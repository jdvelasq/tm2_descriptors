"The role of social media marketing activities in converting existing students into university advocates","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165642291&doi=10.1080%2f08841241.2023.2225431&partnerID=40&md5=056a75315d8a0c4665c0d2dc92780c16","This paper focuses on university social media marketing (SMM) activities and their role in converting following students into university advocates on social media. The study, which has a relationship-oriented approach, first categorizes university SMM activities into four groups: entertainment, interaction, trendiness, and customization. Then it provides the theoretical background for the research model and unveils the role of university SMM on university image, student satisfaction, student loyalty, and electronic word-of-mouth (e-WoM). Data was gathered from 1072 university students in an undergraduate program at 55 universities in Istanbul, Turkey. Structural equation modeling was used to test the model. Results indicate that a university’s SMM activities have a significant role in spreading favorable attributes of universities on social media, and university image, student satisfaction, and student loyalty foster this relationship. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","brand advocacy; Social media marketing; student loyalty; student satisfaction; university image; word-of-mouth communication",""

The direct effect of CSR on brand loyalty, and indirect effects through brand reputation and brand trust have been investigated. Data for this study were collected from 300 students attending a private university in Malaysia. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to assess the measurement model and test the proposed hypotheses. Study findings support all hypotheses. The results confirm the positive direct effect of CSR on brand reputation and brand loyalty, as well as the indirect effects of CSR on brand loyalty through brand reputation and brand trust. This study makes a unique theoretical contribution to the literature through assessing and comparing the mediating role of brand reputation and brand trust between CSR and brand loyalty using the Hierarchy of Effects Model. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","brand loyalty; brand reputation; brand trust; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); higher education; the Hierarchy of Effects Model (HEM)",""

The first analysis of university reputation through the twin perspectives of performance analysis and scientific mapping is presented. The aim of this study is to employ bibliometric tools to visualize the thematic development, the relations, and the tendencies between the topics related with university reputation. In particular, (i) identify the structure of the relationships between past, present, and future research topics; and (ii) determine emerging research trends in the topic research from a longitudinal perspective. Concretely, a bibliometric analysis based on the co-occurrence of keywords (co-word analysis) was carried out, drawing from a sample of 219 papers extracted from the Web of Science. The main results indicated that the university reputation has, as a research topic, only started to attract academic attention more conclusively since 2006. Above all, for the differentiation of some terms from other concepts such as image and where a maturity of analysis has yet to be reached, especially in such topics as university governance and social networks (digital reputation). Moreover, there are topics considered emerging that leave possibilities for research development.

Consequently, the promotional content they produce has changed over the years in many countries. This study investigated whether these neo-liberal trends have impacted the discourse of Pakistani universities’ promotional content, especially the interpersonal relationship between the prospective students and the university. Incorporating Halliday's Functional Grammar with a Critical Discourse Analytical perspective, the textual analysis of the interpersonal meta-function of language reveals that the universities predominantly employ declarative to realize the speech function of a statement; thus, conveying information without generating an imagined dialogue with the students. Following this, imperatives are used to perform the illocutionary function of offer and in rare cases conditional, optative and question statements. The results also established that the universities employ modalities and modulations sparingly which accounts for the text producers’ preference for conveying their propositions in the form of facts, hence leaving no scope for the reader to form his/her opinion. The infrequent use of pronouns in Pakistani universities leads to a lack of liveliness and affinity in writing. The textual analysis reveals that the universities uphold a manifest distance from potential students. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","higher education; interpersonal relation; Marketing trends; Pakistan; prospectuses; students; university",""
"A theoretical and empirical investigation into the effect of accreditation tenure and affiliation on distinctiveness","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179737352&doi=10.1080%2f08841241.2023.2292115&partnerID=40&md5=cce82592546e05af74c383c6194433f1","The objective of this study is to develop knowledge on why some accredited programmes are more distinct. Accreditation and distinctiveness are both important in higher education: maintaining accreditation signals quality, while distinctiveness helps programmes meet their stakeholders’ preferences. Our application of two-stage valuation theory implies that programmes are higher on distinctiveness when they view distinctiveness as beneficial without it posing a substantial risk to their reaccreditation. We quantitatively test the implications of two-stage valuation theory through text analysis of 369 mission statements of business programmes with accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). We examined mission statements, because the AACSB requires that mission statements reflect programmes’ aspirations such as distinctiveness. The multisource data show an inverse U-shaped relationship between accreditation tenure and distinctiveness. The data also show that public programmes have lower distinctiveness than private programmes across lengths of accreditation tenure. This research contributes by helping to shift the discussion from whether reaccreditation helps or harms distinctiveness to how and when reaccreditation impacts distinctiveness. Further, it demonstrates that affiliation serves as a boundary condition on the effect of reaccreditation on distinctiveness. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AACSB; accreditation; distinctiveness; tenure; two-stage valuation theory",""

In three experiments, we show that identical educational material associated with strong (vs. weak or unknown) brand names can boost students’ performance on various educational assessments. We find that this effect occurs via an expectancy mechanism. Study 1 demonstrates that playing an educational game framed as being developed by an institution with a strong brand improves students’ concentration on a subsequent task. In Study 2, studying an educational course supposedly published by a strong brand is shown to improve performance on a memorization task. Study 3 finds that students value educational content more when they are told it is associated with a strong educational brand. This leads to improvements in students’ performance on a numerical reasoning test.

Unless there is conceptual congruence between positioning strategies and rankings, the signals may become diffused and confusing for prospective students. This paper seeks the congruence between positioning strategies and ranking. Since without a validated typology of positioning strategies, such congruence cannot be sought, this paper firstly aims to develop an empirically derived typology of positioning strategies for HEIs. The population consists of HEIs in the UK. Content analysis was used to analyze the WebPages of HEIs to identify positioning bases, and congruence and contradictions between those positioning bases and ranking were identified by correspondence analysis. As a result, a new positioning typology consisting of eight bases, which are top of the range, campus life experience, internationalization, teaching excellence, research quality, graduates prospects, location, and value for money, was identified. In conclusion, HEIs are categorized into three different groups as Leaders and Challengers, Followers, and Nichers and Cost Leaders, and recommendations about how to guarantee congruence between positioning strategy and ranking were made. HEIs should choose positioning bases in line with their rankings since congruence strengthens the position in the minds. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Brand positioning; information asymmetry; positioning strategy; ranking; Signaling theory; university branding",""

The key findings from these articles were sequenced through cosine similarity on R in an algorithmically structured way. This new method can help researchers connect the insights drawn from the use of social media marketing activities and developments in higher education literature and provide marketing professionals at universities with invaluable clues to develop social media marketing strategies to be implemented within their higher education institutions to develop their brand, become more competitive and meet their marketing goals. Furthermore, ADS can be applied to any domain to link extant literature or thematically homogeneous documents to each another for a systematically synthesized cohesive review. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","algorithmic document sequencing; higher education; Social media marketing; student recruitment; systematic literature review",""

This contrasts with previous studies that measured variables that showed an inconsistent influence as predictors of alumni’s desire to contribute. Alumni connectedness, built from socio-psychological literature, is a multidimensional variable that can capture the complexity of the alumni-university relationship. Connectedness consists of relatability, dependency and a sense of community, which combine students’ experiences with university services while at university and afterward This research utilized an online survey that yielded 642 usable responses to validate the model. The model testing results indicate that connectedness significantly influences alumni’s intentions to contribute. Extending relationship marketing principles, this model may assist in restructuring alumni databases by classifying different degrees of alumni connectedness. The differences in connectedness level can help design more contextual alumni marketing programs. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Alumni connectedness; alumni giving behavior; higher education institution (HEI); satisfaction; university services",""

The objective of this work is to analyze the loyalty of university graduates (willing to follow university studies again and/or repeat the same qualification), while identifying the decisive socio-demographic factors (sex, age, father and mother qualifications) and related to university characteristics and experience (type of university, localization, scholarships, mobility, skills, among others) that may motivate their loyalty, especially considering whether they are employed or they have quickly entered the labor market after completing university. The data used were extracted from a survey administered by the National Statistics Institute of Spain (INE) to a sample of 31,651 graduates. Willingness to repeat their university studies was stronger where parents had better educational levels, students received scholarships, or they participated in exchange programs. Regarding their willingness to repeat the course, the only factors that strengthened loyalty were having followed other studies.

A country also has an affective image and personality that may surpass the influence of cognitive image in a consumer’s decision-making process. However, marketing scholars are apt to disregard these elements when they examine a consumer’s purchase decision-making, which results in an incomplete understanding of the country image’s roles in consumer’s purchase decision. This study aims to bridge the gap by examining the effects of country image and country personality on international students’ decisions for study destinations. Samples of middle- and upper-class high school students in Indonesia were selected using a multistage cluster sampling technique. From over 1,000 questionnaires distributed in eight provinces, 888 responses have been used in data analysis. Structural equation modeling using PLS-SEM was used to analyze the data due to the normal distribution issue. The findings showed that both cognitive and affective country images affected students’ intention to study in foreign destinations, either directly or indirectly through country personality and institution image. Based on these findings, the host country's government should focus on creating both positive cognitive and affective country images to attract Indonesian students. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Country image; country personality; institution image; intention; international education",""

Although research and theory in higher education marketing has been addressing this key issue for decades, a clear picture of how to capture and monitor the reputation of higher education institutions has not emerged. As a result, recommendations on how to apply systematic reputation management in the HEI setting are lacking. We review traditional conceptualizations of the construct of reputation, identify common challenges to reputation measurement, and examine their application in higher education settings. Bringing together the baselines from these fields, we argue along four main lines that recommending a theoretically acceptable way to capture HEI reputation is tantamount to an unsolvable task. As a solution to the impasse, we call for an exploration of altered perspectives on reputation measurement for the HEI context. Increased consideration of relevance and departures from existing attempts are two issues that are particularly addressed. To advance the theory and encourage new thinking, we develop several lines of research that we hope will inspire further work in this important area and move the field toward more applicable solutions. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","controlling; higher education; higher education management; measurement; Reputation",""

The findings demonstrate that brand name does not matter very much in lower-ranking universities. But in higher-ranking universities, brand name adaptation leads to higher behavior intention. In addition, the mediation test demonstrates that processing fluency (pronunciation fluency and meaning fluency) is the underlying mechanism to determine the behavior intention.

Data were collected from 402 members of teaching staff to test the proposed model and hypotheses using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results prove the fitness of the suggested model and that the constructs of internal branding (supervisory support, effective internal communication, clear vision and values) do have a significant impact on teaching staff commitment except for the construct of directed training programs (DTP), contrary to previous literature which might be because teaching staff commitment may require variables other than training programs which in turn rings a bell for private universities’ management to partially reconsider the budgets directed to training for teaching staff or it could be due to cultural differences as previous literature was mostly conducted in different cultures, thus a value addition of this study. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","educational services; Internal branding; internal customer commitment; private higher education sector in Egypt; structural equation modeling (SEM)",""

Recruitment pages often seek to demonstrate the benefits of studying at the institution by adopting an objective approach that makes use of textual content that emphasises facts and data. Story-based text consisting of alumni experiences of a programme of studies represent an alternative textual approach to argument based content that can put across a personal view of experiences. The research proposes hypotheses about the impact of these two types of content on website stickiness and the role of gender, using an experimental methodology. We use Facebook ads over 24 days to recruit participants and to collect gender and stickiness metrics using Google Analytics. Analyses show stronger stickiness results for story-based content and differences between the two types of content by gender. The results support narrative paradigm theory that suggests that story basedcommunication is more effective than argument-based communication.

The results suggest that satisfaction and reputation are the antecedents of loyalty, although the importance of each varies depending on the stakeholder in question, since stakeholders respond to different strategic patterns. Thus, in the case of students, satisfaction is clearly the predominant variable, while for social entities, reputation is more relevant.

BGC that included four universities’ tweets and UGC that consisted of consumer comments were analyzed by content and correspondence analysis in R programming language. The findings indicated that BGC was in alignment with universities’ generic strategies. BGC-UGC dispersions across brand personality were in alignment for the differentiator university, while there was a mismatch between BGC and UGC for low-cost universities. The differentiator university was associated with being prestigious, cosmopolitan, and conscientious, while the low-cost universities were associated with sincerity.

This research focus is contextualised with analysis on the CDM process and the disparity between UK and international students, to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the influential factors. The findings of this research point to accreditation, price and rankings having the most influence on CDM among prospective online MBA students. It suggests that the CDM process among international students is more extensive than among UK students. International students’ searches had a longer duration, compared more programme alternatives, favoured detailed information such as course content and marketing materials, and searches often culminated in an application to more than one university. Meanwhile, UK students were more influenced by outbound university phone communications, which the data imply is attributable to English being their first language. Concluding practical recommendations include marketing messaging optimisation, strategic focus on rankings, accreditation and pricing and driving brand loyalty among prospective international students. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","consumer decision-making; Higher Education; Marketing; MBA; online Education",""

Echoing this line of thought, this exploratory paper analyses the interrelationship between the level of IMC adopted and business performance in higher education institutions (HEIs). The methodology used is linear regressions and CART trees to test the proposed hypotheses. Results show a positive association between the degree to which IMC is adopted and business performance on three levels (institutional, faculty, and master’s). This paper makes several contributions. First, we propose three scales that measure the business performance of HEIs, their faculties, and their master’s degrees. Second, we assess the relationships between IMC and business performance on three distinct levels in higher education (HE) in a non-English speaking European country. Third, we take into account two different perspectives: those of managers and academics. Finally, our discussion highlights that universities should strive to achieve the highest level of IMC because this is positively associated with their performance in terms of sales, branding, and satisfaction. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","business performance (BP); higher education (HE); higher education institution (HEI); Integrated marketing communication (IMC); scales",""

The specification of the student not merely as a ‘customer’ means that traditional marketing no longer has sufficient capacity to explain the behavior of the student body. In this study, a four-level relationship marketing model is tested to check the influence of perceived organizational support (POS) and perceived employability on identification with the institution and the perceived price-quality ratio and how these influence student satisfaction. In addition, the constructs prior to POS and perceived employability are identified, which are explicit enough to enable specific marketing actions to be carried out. As POS is a construct defined for the labor market, its use applied to relational marketing comes up as something innovative. To this end, Likert scales have been designed and validated to measure these constructs. The results of this test show how the perception of organizational support depends on the relationship of the student body with the administration and management of the center. Likewise, the perception of employability depends on the perceived reputation and the perception of the promotion of employability.

To recognise this is not to be controversial but to confirm the rhetoric of what is delivered by universities. We suggest that the recognition of the inherent tensions can have benefits for students and for the university itself and suggest a notion of relationship might provide a worthwhile conceptual framework to effect this. We argue that a fundamental remit of universities should be to implement policies to nurture diversity amongst the cohort and to develop the individuality of each student and demonstrate that the feeling of being treated as a valued individual by academic tutors is fundamental to the symbiotic relationship between students and university.

Data from 339 parents of prospective university students were collected and analysed using structural equation modelling. The findings reveal that parents’ experience with university staff, perception of other parents, and quality of university facilities affect parents’ satisfaction. The results suggest that parents satisfied with a university are more likely to recommend that university to their children and prefer the university brand. These two constructs were found to influence university choice for those parents with non-similar education to a university programme. For parents with similar education to a university programme, only parents’ university brand preference influences university choice. © 2022 The Author(s).

The primary data were collected based on a survey of students at two public universities–United Arab Emirates University and Zayed University, as well as three private universities–New York University, Abu Dhabi University, and Alain University. The data were analyzed using an ANOVA test, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using SPSS and Smart PLS software. This study found high reliability and validity of the scale under five dimensions, which determine the student’s choice of the university. The findings show that several factors, such as the academic reputation, grants and funding, location and proximity, facilities and services, promotional and marketing channels, drive students’ choices for studying at universities in UAE. This finding will help the administrators of private and public universities in the UAE, in particular, and other regional and international universities, in general, address the growing competition among the institutions of higher education.

Self-esteem needs were a critical part of this process, positively influencing how much students liked a particular university. Results also suggest that the choice of a college/university may very well be similar to the purchase of luxury products, such as choosing a prestigious brand watch, handbag, or automobile. Despite the hopes of faculty and administrators, students may not think of instructional quality first when choosing higher education. These results have implications for colleges and universities, for students making educational choices, and for the general public. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","extension of self; Higher education choice; luxury consumption; self-image; university brand image",""

A theoretical debate on definitional and measurement issues has also been growing. Thanks to the benefits that IMC can offer organizations, it is interesting to study it with regards to the higher education (HE) environment since higher education institutions (HEIs) have been focusing on the potential of different and new ways of communication and their integration. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to explore the concept of IMC in HE. And second, to present a tool that measures the level of integration of marketing and communication achieved in the HE context in a non-English speaking country, while also considering different perceptions in the same organization. The methodology of this paper is based on a multi-stage research design adopting qualitative and quantitative approaches. The main contributions are a reliable and valid adaptation of a tool that measures the level of IMC in a set of selected HEIs and a proposal of five dimensions that explain IMC in HE context. This will help to build a more robust theoretical body of knowledge regarding not only IMC but also higher education marketing (HEM). © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","higher education institution (HEI); higher education marketing (HEM); Integrated marketing communication (IMC); multi-stage design; scale development",""

A comparison of the teaching quality delivered on different programs of study will be an important element of this decision-making process. The Teaching Excellence Framework proposes that teaching quality will be assessed by measures including the evaluation of student learning gain. This paper reflects on an analysis of consultation responses from key stakeholders across the UK higher education sector to determine how evaluating learning gain could be effectively achieved. Synthesizing these responses, ten key considerations regarding evaluating learning gain have been identified that together provide a unique perspective to ensure that any evaluation of student learning gain subsequently undertaken is relevant to the marketing of higher education. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","higher education; learning gain; Marketing; marketization; student learning; teaching excellence",""

This paper looks to address the issues of branding in higher education by exploring the themes present in PSAs aired by American universities. In study one, researchers examined current PSAs employed by National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Football Bowl Subdivision schools of varying academic rank to evaluate the differences in messaging approaches. In study two, the researchers conducted a framework analysis to generate an understanding of what role international themes play in PSAs of 'high-ranking' institutions.

Hypotheses are tested on survey data collected from 378 respondents facing a high-involvement service choice. The results suggest that two distinct information processing routes are active when consumers (here prospective students) evaluate complex beliefs. Furthermore, service values have distinct effects on the processing of WOM information. Self-oriented values foster more cognitive processing, whereas socially oriented values have the opposite effect. Considering the reasons as to why a service is needed (service values) should be a focus for marketers since they can be a powerful persuasion approach affecting the processing of WOM. This study contributes to earlier research on higher education marketing by incorporating service values into the pre-purchase phase of prospective students’ decision-making. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","consumer evaluation; credence criteria; high-involvement service; higher education; information processing; Service values; word-of-mouth",""

Based on the model of student buyer behavior developed by Kotler and Fox in 1995, the study focuses on the first step of this model, so-called motives. The study results are based on qualitative data collected by means of semi-structured styles of interviews with 30 current students at three higher education institutions in Syria in the summer of 2010.The study reveals three dimensions of needs and motives. These are: Self needs and motives; Social needs and motives, and Souk (market) needs and motives. Accordingly, several detailed explanations for each dimension concluded from the study are presented. The findings reveal that the three dimensions are important for university students in Syria when attending universities. People responsible for marketing in higher education institutions need to pay attention to understand their students' motives when designing their customer-oriented marketing strategies. Study programs at universities could be designed to better satisfy such needs and motives. This study could provide bases for further research through a replication of the model using the information offered by the survey. Further research could investigate the research questions in a wider student population employing a quantitative approach. The importance of this study comes from the classification of needs and motives into a three-Ss model (Self, Society and Souk).

In view of this, a students' evaluation instrument containing 25 items which has good psychometric characteristics has been proposed. Furthermore, since some criteria of students' evaluation of teaching are usually developed before others, and thus may influence them, the paper attempts to identify which among them exert such influence.

Export marketing remains an area of limited focus in the marketization of higher education literature. The study predominantly follows a quantitative research design using survey methods. A sample of British universities was studied and partial least-squares analysis was performed. The findings indicate that four export higher education-specific variables are important drivers of EMO in universities. The paper also confirms EMO's direct effects on university export performance and its indirect effects mediated through university international reputation. In light of these findings, a number of implications are advanced for university management. The study also makes important theoretical contributions: it contributes to a growing body of literature on marketing of higher education; it enriches the export marketing literature by examining EMO in a service setting and it adds to the EMO–export performance relationship by examining the mediating role of international reputation. The findings are limited to British universities. Therefore, they may not be generalizable to other geographical areas. In addition, the results of this study were obtained from a small sample size and generalization of the findings to other higher education institutions should be made with caution. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","export market orientation; higher education marketing; PLS",""

Because admissions brochures often serve as a potential student's introduction to the campus, they are carefully crafted to provide a specific impression of the institution. This study examined one aspect of the marketing of colleges by examining the portrayal of racial and ethnic diversity. Through a content analysis of over 10,000 photographs from 165 four-year institutions in the US, the accuracy of the photographic portrayal of diversity in recruitment materials was assessed. Findings indicate that the majority of institutions provided images of diversity to prospective students in 2011 that were significantly different than the actual student body.

With the mushrooming of business schools (both private autonomous and government supported) and fading global boundaries, especially in the Indian context, communicating a business school brand to stakeholders has become extremely important. It is imperative for Indian business schools to differentiate and build strong brands in the competitive business education space in India. Brand building helps in creating, evolving and enhancing a brand's positioning and its perceptions among stakeholders. These perceptions are critical in influencing behavior and hence the performance of an institution.

Many rust belt states are looking to transform themselves from a state dependent on manufacturing and agriculture to a more diverse knowledge based economy. Many nations use higher education as a catalyst for economic development but rarely has it been viewed as a more local state or province based initiative. Therefore, one often overlooked component of an integrated economic strategy is encouraging more international students to attend college in a particular state, as an economic development tool. International students not only add significantly to the local economy through direct expenditures, but enrich the experiences of domestic students. In addition, many international students remain in the community in which they were educated, adding a global dimension to existing firms, or in many cases, establishing a new entrepreneurial venture. As competition for students intensifies, and states look to find solutions to supplement their growing budget deficits, many more will be looking to promote their public universities to increase international student enrollment. Yet little is known about the perceptions of the two groups, international students and domestic students, who will be most directly impacted by the economic and public policy issues. Understanding the perceptions of international students is crucial to developing an effective marketing plan, while views of domestic students are also important as they shape the experiences of international students and influence public policy. The current study utilised a survey of more than 800 students to measure current students' perceptions in the following three areas: the state economy, impact of international students, and public policy and international students. Results suggest that domestic students are concerned about the state's economic future, have a positive perception of the economic benefits of international students, and support policies to increase international student enrollment.

A great concern is that the knowledge of internal branding and employee brand support in higher education institutions is based on knowledge imported from the business sector, and more practices should thus be adapted and implemented. It is found that transformation leadership, despite being little researched in the internal branding context, remains the pivotal element to the successful implementation of internal branding, as transformational leadership provides space for intellectual stimulation and consideration of individuals who are present at universities.

Thus, we examine category-level reputation within the context of a study measuring the reputational attributes of three distinct categories of post-secondary institutions (medical-doctoral universities, primarily undergraduate universities, and career colleges) among a single key stakeholder group - employers. We leveraged mixed-methods to analyze the reputational attributes of the three categories. This included one-on-one interviews with employers (N = 30) and a survey of hiring managers (N = 164). The results suggest that among this stakeholder group each category possesses distinct reputational attributes that influence its position in the highly competitive educational marketplace. The implication of category-level reputation in higher education may have a profound influence on stakeholder's formation of beliefs and attitudes towards an institution by anchoring an institution's brand in a category. This anchoring effect may be an asset and offer rewards such as increased prestige; however, it may also act as a liability and risk an institution's position.

We contend that individuals who finish a MOOC are more likely to establish a new goal intention for university than those who do not finish. This new goal intention is likely to be prompted by the individual’s satisfaction with their MOOC experience as well as a sense of discontent in not having fulfilled their broader educational goals. For those who do set a new goal for university study, we contend that the institute hosting the MOOC is likely to form part of the consideration set used by individuals to narrow down their choice of tertiary provider. Moreover, we argue that this same host institute is likely to be chosen from the consideration set where the MOOC experience is a satisfying one and where a strong link can be established between the pedagogical and delivery approaches used in both the MOOC and university settings. This research has implications for how tertiary institutes create and use MOOCs, and offers insights into how providers can more effectively market higher education courses to those progressing through a MOOC pathway. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","consideration sets; consumer goal theory; marketing; MOOCs; university",""

This article reports on findings from studies that investigated the brand promises of four UK universities - one from each of the HE 'mission groups'. The evidence indicated that, contrary to existing published presumptions, there is considerable potential for the application of branding in HE, but in differing and nuanced ways. Clear branding themes emerged across the cases such as environment, experiences, aspiration, and global positioning. While these enabled the universities to position their brands with distinction, the overriding method used across the cases - and the key point of differentiation - proved to be the presence of a core brand promise. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","brand promise; differentiation; positioning; universities",""

Being located in a strategic position between Asia, Australasia and Oceania has made it an attractive proposition for foreign higher education providers wanting to expand their international presence. Despite this, there are many market and regulatory challenges facing foreign providers operating as private higher education institutions (HEIs) within Malaysia. To gain a competitive edge they must clearly understand how the many cultures, values, norms, behaviors, and mindsets within Malaysia can be used to drive strategy. Unfortunately, very little is known about Malaysian perceptions of private HEIs compared to public HEIs. By drawing upon utility theory, the aim of this research is to construct a scale for measuring brand identity of HEIs in Malaysia. Data from a sample of 371 students from private and public HEIs in Malaysia were collected and analyzed using structural equation modeling to form a two-factor measurement model consisting of visual and verbal identity cues. Tests of differences were performed, which showed dimensions such as distribution channel, public relations, promotion, core service, price, and system having significant differences between private and public HEIs. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","brand identity; higher education; Malaysia; private education; scale development",""

It is argued that those institutions that have a strong distinctive image will be in a better position to face a changing future. Employing a multistage methodology, the web pages of 20 UK universities were investigated by using a combination of content and multivariable analysis. Results indicated 'traditional values' such as teaching and research were often well communicated in terms of online brand but 'emotional values' like social responsibility and the universities' environments were less consistently communicated, despite their increased topicality. It is therefore suggested that emotional values may offer a basis for possible future online differentiation. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Branding higher education; Branding universities; E branding; Online branding; University branding; Website branding",""

These dimensions are linked to one another. The strong interrelationships between these dimensions are indicative that holistic approach needs to be adopted rather than dealing with each dimension in isolation in creating a valued education. Significant performance gaps of key influences indicated that the satisfaction levels are below students’ expectation despite the satisfaction scores being above average.

This research focuses on students' perceptions of the importance of satisfaction, trust, and commitment in the development of student loyalty. In particular this research examines whether or not these antecedents differ for male versus female students. A structural equation modelling approach was adopted using a sample of 447 students. Despite literature which characterises males as task oriented, and females as relationship oriented, gender did not influence the salience of the antecedents to loyalty. These results show that first and foremost both gender groups seek to form affective and emotional bonds with their institution and hence a sense of psychological closeness to it. Student satisfaction was found to be the second most important driver of loyalty across both genders. Conclusions, implications and opportunities for future research are presented.

Specialized programs are believed to cultivate stronger relationships with students, which lead to stronger alumni relationships and increased donations. This research tests this empirically by examining relationship perceptions and donation behavior among alumni of both traditional and specialized MBA programs from a university. The findings suggest that graduates of specialized programs are more likely to perceive relationships with their MBA programs than their traditional program counterparts. These graduates are also more likely to donate to their universities and to direct their donations toward their specialized MBA programs. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Alumi relationships; Donation behavior; MBA programs",""

The research findings show that market segmentation determines the applicability of internationalization and/or marketing of higher education. Activities related to the internationalization of education play a critical role in influencing the research-oriented students' choice of a Canadian graduate school.

However, far less attention has been placed on how this sense of balance (in its various forms) actually, and specifically, affects the structure and process of undertaking strategic alliance activities between Chinese and foreign companies. This paper deals with this issue by examining agreements and associated activities undertaken between 206 Chinese universities and foreign education partners to identify whether there is any specific sense of balance between the two sides. The paper notes that successful agreements and alliances do reflect a tangible sense of balance in the way the agreements were structured and in terms of the processes used to implement and undertake associated activities. The value of the paper is that it notes that foreign universities and their Chinese partners need to organise and undertake balanced alliances in the Chinese strategic alliance context. The fact that all respondents indicated that balanced alliances were a key to success makes this observation even more useful. This paper, therefore, adds the concept of balance to the literature of strategic alliance in the higher educational field, at least in China. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","China; Culture; Education; Educational contracts",""

The paper then discusses (on the basis of presenting the same set of students with the findings of this part of the research) how foreign universities might adapt their courses and programs to meet the cultural needs of Hong Kong students. It was found that universities need to adopt a delicate balance between respecting traditional Chinese values and concepts, and encompassing more westernized beliefs and attitudes which enable the students to learn in an environment which enables them to express their creativity and individualism, within a fundamentally quite conservative cultural environment.

Student registration data from a large, urban, public university, which is routinely available at little cost, is used to identify five student segments. These segments include traditional students, non-traditional students, a sizable international student segment, a graduating segment, and a group of transferees. The unique needs of each segment are identified and appropriate service strategies are formulated for each segment. The diversity of the segments establish the utility of using target marketing principles for designing service strategies and the viability of using registration database for such a purpose. © 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Although this topic has been studied from a variety of perspectives, the issue of why Hong Kong students might switch from one locally provided foreign university program to another has not been researched despite evidence of it being common. The current research found that students switched to another university if it offered a wider range of course delivery modes, if they could fast track their degree and if they were failing at the existing university. Increasingly, to be successful in competitive markets such as Hong Kong, foreign universities need to deliver their programs in a wide variety of modes, provide high levels of administrative and academic support, and ensure that they assist their students as much as possible. If they do not, students are likely to move to another provider. These findings have complex and far-reaching delivery ramifications for foreign universities wishing to survive in competitive markets such as Hong Kong-and elsewhere-where there is a high degree of competition amongst universities and a stressed economic situation which could force students to adopt quite ruthless consumer behaviour in regards to their university provider.

The type of influencer is investigated in terms of the relevance of their indirect prior experience. The total number of influencers is considered as a useful representation of the level of self-monitoring. Satisfaction, although considered as an attribute of service quality in previous literature, is here modelled as an attitude, viewed from the consumer's internal mental and emotional processing, rather than from the service quality perspective. The findings indicate a strong dependent link between the measure of self-monitoring and the major measure of cognitive satisfaction. There was no such strong link between 'type' of influencer and any measure of cognitive or affective satisfaction, nor was it proved that the 'type' of influencer caused a difference in levels of satisfaction. The relevance of prior experience of others does not exert a very strong effect on levels of satisfaction. Finally the level of self-monitoring, expressed as a behavioural variable, i.e., total number of decision-makers, was found to effect both cognitive and affective levels of satisfaction. The implications for higher education marketers are that affective or emotional satisfaction or dissatisfaction can remain in the applicant's memory for longer than cognitive or thinking satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

The market attractiveness with significant pecuniary and non-pecuniary gains from full-fee paying students will result in a more competitive environment for higher educational institutions around the world seeking to improve their market position. Student satisfaction is a key strategic variable in maintaining such a competitive position with long-term benefits arising from student loyalty, positive word of mouth (WOM) communication and image of the higher educational institutions to meet the challenges of increasing global competition, rising student expectations of quality, service, and value for money. This process requires educational institutions to carefully analyse these key factors contributing to student satisfaction and therefore develop strategies accordingly. Using logistic regression analysis with factor scores and aggregated satisfaction scores, this study examines the relative importance of factors and their impact on the satisfaction levels of international postgraduate students from four Asian countries studying in Australian universities. The study concludes that the dominant factors that impact on student satisfaction are quality of education, student facilities, reputation of the institutions, the marketability of their degrees for better career prospects, and the overall customer value provided by the universities.

This is particularly so for small regional campuses that compete with larger universities in the state capitals. Campus management needs to carefully monitor both the perceptions of prospective students within the catchment area, and the (dis)satisfaction levels of current students. This study reports the results of an exploratory investigation into the perceptions held of a small regional campus, using two techniques that have arguably been underutilized in the education marketing literature. Repertory Grid Analysis, a technique developed fifty years ago, was used to identify attributes deemed salient to year 12 high school students at the time they were applying for university places. Importance-performance analysis (IPA), developed three decades ago, was then used to identify attributes that were determinant for a new cohort of first year undergraduate students. The paper concludes that group applications of Repertory Grid offer education market researchers a useful technique for identifying attributes used by high school students to differentiate universities; and that IPA is a useful technique for guiding promotional decision making. In this case the two techniques provided a quick, economical and effective snapshot of market perceptions, which can be used as a foundation for the development of an ongoing market research program. Practical steps for such a program are summarized. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Determinant attributes; Importance-performance analysis; Perceptions of universities; Repertory grid",""

This approach is predicated on the grounds that a large amount of research in consumer behavior has shown that in markets where there are many alternative brands, consumers use phased-decision strategies. In these research studies, the consumer is conceptualized as first filtering the alternative brands using relatively simple criteria and then undertaking a more detailed analysis of the reduced sets of brands. Drawing on this research in consumer behaviour and the relevant college choice literature in the fields of education and sociology, we develop a process model of individual brand choice. The composition of the consideration and choice sets was defined in terms of the proportion of “old” and “new” universities. In order to test our model, we used a sample of undergraduate UK students who had just gone through the process of choosing a university. Overall, the results for both consideration and choice sets tend to support the view that the brands (i.e., type of university) contained in these two sets are dissimilar, i.e., independent. In order of importance, we found that the three variables of ethnic group, age, and university proximity were the most important in predicting the composition of both the consideration and choice sets. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Composition of consideration and choice sets; Hierarchical decision sets; High-involvement service; Model development and testing; Model testing; Phased-decision strategies; Pre-purchase information search outcomes; Undergraduate university choice processes",""

A hierarchal model is used as a framework for this analysis. Fifteen hypotheses are formulated and tested, in order to identify the dimensions of service quality as perceived by university students, to examine students' overall satisfaction with influential factors such as tuition fees (price) and university image, and to determine the impact of students' overall satisfaction on favourable future behavioural intentions. Students' perceptions of these constructs are compared using demographic factors such as gender, age, and ethnicity. Statistical support is found for the use of a hierarchical model, three primary dimensions, and ten sub-dimensions. In addition, the results support a relationship between service quality and price; service quality, image, and satisfaction; and satisfaction and favourable future behavioual intentions. However, there is no statistical support for a relationship between price and satisfaction. The results also suggest that students' perceptions of the constructs are primarily influenced by their ethnicity and year of study. The results of this analysis contribute to the service marketing theory by providing empirically-based insight into satisfaction and service quality constructs in the higher education sector. This study will assist higher education management developing and implementing a market-oriented service strategy, in order to achieve a high quality of service, enhance students' level of satisfaction and create favourable future behavioural intentions. © 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Among other things, the instrument inquires about the importance of 16 college characteristics, followed by quality ratings of specific colleges that the student considered on these same characteristics. This study investigated the utility of importance weights in the assessment of college choice, examining how much the importance rating would improve one's ability to predict the student's actual college choice over and above what is possible with just the quality ratings. Another purpose of the study was to determine if importance ratings and quality ratings were independent of each other or associated in some way. Two types of weights were studied: (1) standardised weights created by averaging the importance ratings of the entire sample; and (2) subjective weights unique to each respondent. The weights were combined with quality ratings by either: (1) multiplying the quality rating by the importance rating; or by (2) subtracting the quality rating from the importance rating (gap score). Standardised weights did not improve prediction at all, and subjective weights only improved the predictability of college choice by a very miniscule amount (about 1%). Importance and quality ratings were found to be associated, especially in the ratings of the college that the student decided to attend. Some correlations were linear in nature, but many were non-linear, such that characteristics rated high or low were perceived as more important than characteristics assigned mid-range quality ratings. It was concluded that importance weights do not enhance prediction of college choice, but they may be useful for administrators in prioritising interventions. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Admitted student questionnaire plus (ASQ<sup>+</sup>); College choice; Gap scores; Importance; Quality; Ratings; Weights",""

Although there has been considerable research regarding various aspects of these alliances, including the types of activities undertaken, and the levels of alliances formed in this sector (Hayhoe 1989, 1996; Willis 2000), there has been less evaluation of the factors which have motivated the majority of Chinese universities to actively seek suitable foreign partners for collaboration particularly in regard to the delivery of activities and programs within China. This research identifies a range of factors driving the Chinese desire to form alliances with foreign universities. These in general relate to the special and somewhat idiosyncratic role of universities as agents of social and economic change in China. To effect this change they have often sought foreign partners who are able to assist China to develop a market economy. Universities within the Chinese top 100 university system have become increasingly selective in their choice of foreign universities and are requiring far higher levels of commitment than hitherto. It is now not unusual for foreign universities to deliver degree programs in China, and not just via study abroad and distance means. Gradually, over time, Chinese universities have become more discerning, particular and careful in the selection of foreign university partners. To this end, this paper identifies three distinct phases of Chinese university selection of foreign partners, dating back to 1978. The current phase, which emerged around 2000-2001 underscores the growing desire on the part of Chinese universities to select better quality, more committed and longer-term foreign partners-partly an issue of signing agreements with fewer, but better universities than in the past when a more ""scattergun"" approach was utilised. doi:10.1300/J050v16n01_06.

Quantitative research developed from the focus group responses and based on a stated preferences [choice] survey of school students [n = 526] followed. Students' preferences regarding university choice were predominantly influenced by the quality and flexibility of the degree and or course options, likelihood that employers will recruit from the university, the extent that university accommodation is subsidized and the overall cost of attending the university positioned in comparison to other universities. Secondary students would prefer not to attend a university with access restricted to an 'A' bursary examination mark [bursary is a New Zealand pre college examination to gain fee subsidy], that has limited first year accommodation, or which offers sports scholarships. New Zealand secondary school students are relatively price insensitive, with the cost of attending university not perceived as a deterrent. Moreover, the research findings show a positive cost-value relationship exists in students' choice preferences.

"Potential of the social media as instruments of higher education marketing: A segmentation study","2011","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79958181690&doi=10.1080%2f08841241.2011.573593&partnerID=40&md5=f117b01244836aa1cb329453b812d260","The importance of social media as platforms of social interaction, communication and marketing is growing. Increasing numbers of businesses in various industries have already integrated or plan to integrate social media applications into their marketing programs. Higher education institutions show increased interest in the potential of social media as a marketing tool. Particularly important is the potential of these tools to reach and attract future students. An important issue for research is to understand how potential students use social media and what their role is in the decision making process of choosing a program of study, a University, or College. This paper identifies market segments among future students based on the use of the social media and examines the impact of the social media on the choice of a higher education program and institution. The study is based on data collected by means of a national survey among future university students in the Netherlands. Future students are pupils from the last two years of secondary education. Market segmentation was carried out based on the use of social media, by means of a cluster analysis and a factor analysis; the latter proved to be the best choice since it produced more differentiated market segments. The findings indicate the existence of three distinct segments in the population of future students in the Netherlands on the basis of social media use. Another major finding of the study is that future students are mostly interested in social interaction and information seeking when using social media, while the content contributed by this group is limited to photo and video sharing. Compared to traditional communication channels social media still play a secondary role in the students' choice. While penetration of socialmedia is extremely high among future students, the impact of these in the choice of study and institution is relatively low compared to more traditional forms of university marketing. This paper provides university marketers with a useful insight into the developments in the market and discusses various options and opportunities for engaging social media as effective marketing tools. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Higher education marketing; Market segmentation; Social media; Student recruitment; Web 2.0",""

Recent research findings suggest that the factors that create student satisfaction with teaching ('teaching satisfiers') may be qualitatively differently from the factors that create dissatisfaction with teaching. Thus, this research uses the Kano methodology to reveal the characteristics of professors that students take for granted ('Must-be factors') and that have the potential to delight them ('Excitement factors'). Kano questionnaires containing 19 attributes of effective professors taken from previous studies and focus group discussions were handed out in two marketing courses to 63 postgraduate students enrolled in a service marketing course. The Kano results corroborate previous US findings that revealed the importance of personality in general and support studies that stress the importance of professors creating rapport with their students in particular. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Educational services; Effective professors; Kano methodology; Quality attributes; Student satisfaction",""

Accordingly, the market for MDPs can be described as being very competitive. The purpose of this exploratory research is to provide insights for public universities which should help them better understand the needs and wants of buyers. Armed with this information, public universities should then be in a position to compete more effectively with providers from the private sector. In order to provide such insights, this empirical research was motivated by two broad research questions: (1) How do organizations purchase MDPs? (2) What design characteristics would current purchasers of MDPs like to be built into future MDPs?

The objective was to identity important criteria used to select a university. In addition, this study compared the responses of students from these schools to determine whether selection criteria differ. Using a Likert scale of important to unimportant, students from these universities rated ten of the 52 criteria important to their selection. They included: programs, academic reputation, degree marketability, faculty contact time, accreditations, assistantship/campus employment, financial aids, placement reputation, completion time, and library size. However, they rated academic reputation and completion time significantly different. The private school students rated academic reputation significantly (0.00) more important, whereas the public school students rated completion time significantly (0.03) more important. To attract prospective private school students to public schools, public school administrators would benefit by emphasizing the quality and reputation of its faculty and programs. Private school administrators are likely to attract more students if they are able to improve the quality and increase the quantity of computer facilities. Moreover, they would profit from designing flexible programs and classes that would allow for a more rapid completion time. © 1996 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

This paper describes two action research projects undertaken by staff in the International Office to engender improved quality of service delivery and subsequently an improved image of the university in the process of informal marketing. The results of the action research projects have produced specific outcomes, further planning and changes to management practices in the International Office, all related to improving the quality of services being delivered and the quality of management, a strategy that can be adopted in universities worldwide. Each research project was small, but facilitated changes or improvement to a target, strategically identified and discussed with management. These projects did not occur as strategic parts of an overall marketing plan, but were recognised as making contributions to effective outcomes of the existing marketing process. The paper then discusses the role of management in employee empowerment and the action research process arguing that management's role is to ensure that stimuli such as this are not Stifled. © 1998 Taylor Francis Group LLC.","",""

The answer lies not in expanding resources, but rather through solutions than can be found by clearly and precisely integrating the institution's communications and marketing goals with its strategic and academic goals. The successful marketing structure will support the institutional profit centers, and more specifically, will focus on its primary profit center: student recruitment and retention. Effective market and communications plans, and resulting strategies, can be best accomplished through a task force concept that melds the capability to create and implement plans that effectively respond to those opportunities identified through an integrated marketing effort. The desired net result is the employment of all the resources and assets from development, alumni relations, communications, and admissions in a synergistic way that introduces and reinforces the institution's image in those key areas. Marketing and communications are not the central purposes of an organization; but they are critical functions and, as such, cannot be, as is done in many colleges today, relegated to the lowest rung of the organizational ladder. The process of restructuring and rebuilding can be successfully facilitated using techniques such as Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) that focus on reforming thinking and constituting new tasks. However, these tools and techniques can provide effective change only if the parties involved agree that change is required and can be achieved only through revolution, rather than evolution.While true integration is a lofty goal, it is critical in today's noisy marketplace because the more integrated and consistent an institution's marketing and communications activities are, the more likely it is to realize significant gains in its visibility and reputation. © 1999 by The Haworth Press, Inc.","Advantages and disadvantages; Latent themes; Non-traditional programs; Student perceptions",""

One strategy that has not received much attention is a price differential strategy. A tuition price differential allows schools or departments within a university to charge a different (higher) tuition rate as opposed to a flat rate tuition charge. Primary concerns for not adopting such a strategy is the fear of losing students to competitive institutions or sustaining criticism from various constituencies. Such a strategy however, may be effective if communicated to students and others. A price differential may serve as a legitimate signal of quality. The benefits, however, from the price increase must be evident in tangible terms for the student.

Previous research has identified four levels of alliance activity/agreement available to foreign and Chinese universities, ranging from low level to high level alliances. This paper explores the issue of whether foreign universities moved through these levels of alliances as a form of staggered market entry and whether commitment increased as they undertook higher forms of alliances. The research found that there was almost no movement between the various levels of alliance, and that high levels of commitment were required at all levels to make an alliance successful. This means that foreign universities have to be careful to establish alliances with Chinese universities which initially meet their specific needs rather than assume that alliance programs can simply be moved upwards or downwards in level and scale over time. They also need to be aware that a high level of commitment will be required to make any alliance successful and that this commitment will be measured in tangible (resources) and intangible (relationship) ways.

The practice of changing a firm's name to send a signal and to broaden consumer appeal is one such strategy. It is an expensive and controversial strategy when used by schools, but is it also effective? We hypothesize that an effective name change strategy will positively impact a school’s enrollment. Using the time series quasi design approach, we analyzed the pre-event and post-event incremental change in enrollment on a sample 140 colleges and universities. We used a five-year pre-event and a five-year post-event analysis period. The results show that, on average, the strategic name change has no significant impact on the post-event enrollment patterns. The t-value is 1.61. A further analysis of the incremental enrollment patterns of the individual schools, shows that only 10 (about 7%) of the sample experienced significant incremental change in post-event enrollments (significance level of 5%, a two-tailed test). Hence, college administrators who are contemplating using the strategy as a marketing tool to boost declining enrollments are advised to proceed with extreme caution. © 1997 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

A substantial shift in the demographic trends for traditional aged college students 18 to 24 years old from 30,350,000 in 1980 to 25,231,000 will occur by the year 2000. This decrease of prospects for institutions of higher education will stimulate a significant rise in competitive efforts to recruit and retain undergraduate students. Such efforts may include increases in financial aid, scholarships, housing facilities, co-curricular activities and/or the hiring of more specialized faculty. Notably, they will also result in a modification of the curriculum. It is this curriculum transformation which will continue to accelerate the introduction of marketing internship programs into academia. This article will explore four alternate models of MIPs: (1) the Faculty Model, (2) the Faculty/Administrative Model, (3) the College of Business Administration Model and (4) the Administrative Model. These models present options for any level of commitment from the College Internship Office to the College of Business faculty. The implementation of any of these models will provide a plausible approach to offering the best possible MIP while contributing to overall college recruitment and retention efforts. © 1996 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The admissions officers were asked to report the use and perceived effectiveness of the following fifteen marketing techniques: Publicity, target marketing, market segmentation, advertising, program development, market positioning, market research, access, marketing plan, pricing, marketing committee, advertising research, consultants, marketing audit, and marketing director. The results clearly indicate and increase in the acceptance, use and perceived effectiveness of the fifteen techniques. However, the data also indicate that many institutions are not consistent in their use of the marketing techniques. For example, many institutions use target marketing without first applying market segmentation, and then neglect to develop a positioning strategy vis-à-vis their competition. The very low use of developing marketing plans, using marketing directors, committees, or consultant’s points to a lack of integration of marketing throughout the organization as well as a lack of a strategic marketing focus. While marketing certainly had become more accepted, it is still in its infancy at many institutions. Marketing is viewed as an excellent way to attract students and yet is not commonly seen as a way to increase student satisfaction, lower attrition, and develop strategic and competitive advantages in the marketplace.

The University of Western Australia’s MBA program began in 1973. Using the records for this period, demographic variables are tested as predictors of student success. It is found that students who have been admitted without taking the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) do significantly worse than average, as do those students whose previous degrees were in the professional fields of Medicine, Law and Architecture. Women do less well than men, though this is explained by the fact that a larger percentage of women have been admitted without GMAT scores. It is also found that, for those students admitted to the course, the GMAT score (except for very high scores) and the years of work experience are not significantly related to success. This result is interpreted as indicating, not that GMAT score and work experience are unrelated to success, but rather that these criteria have been appropriately weighed against other criteria in the selection procedure. © 1990 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The current paper reviews the research which has been conducted on home schooling to answer four questions of importance to college or university officials as they contemplate targeting this group: (1) why do parents home school? (2) what are the characteristics of home schoolers? (3) would home schoolers make good college students? and (4) how could a college or university effectively reach out to home schoolers?

Arguably, one such area centers around the topic of ’style’ (i.e., how something is said rather than what is said) and its potential effect on how student recruits may perceive and react to recruitment ads. Consequently, the study reported here addresses this very topic. Specifically, this study tested reader response to recruitment ads of identical content but written in eight different styles. Our results suggest that certain styles, independently and in combination, do affect readers’ perceptions along such lower-order assessment dimensions as ad interest, appeal, believability, and clarity, yet do not differentially affect much broader, overall measures such as overall attitude toward the ad or intent to respond.

Conversely, keeping already-admitted students is a relatively new phenomenon that recognizes the important contribution that retention makes, along with recruitment, to total enrollment. This paper reasons that recruitment and retention are not, and should not, be operating in total isolation of one another. Indeed they are not mutually exclusive. The researchers propose that the variable linking recruitment and retention is college choice - the selection process that a student goes through in choosing a college and forming expectations of the institution selected.

The findings illustrated that: A marketing orientation was almost non-existent, there was evidence of a dichotomy between the Faculty and the Administration about marketing effectiveness, the most used marketing techniques were the least effective, and the least used were the most effective. Additionally, factor analysis results did not support a clear portrayal of five factors of marketing effectiveness as identified in the overseas research, but rather a single marketing effectiveness factor.

The admissions officers were asked to report the use and perceived effectiveness of the following fifteen marketing techniques: Publicity, target marketing, market segmentation, advertising, program development, market positioning, market research, access, marketing plan, pricing, marketing committee, advertising research, consultants, marketing audit, and marketing director. The result clearly indicate an increase in the acceptance, use and perceived effectiveness of the fifteen techniques. However, the data also indicate that many institutions are not consistent in their use of the marketing techniques. For example, many institutions use target marketing without first applying market segmentation, and then neglect to develop a positioning strategy vis-à-vis their competition. The very low use rate of developing marketing plans, using marketing directors, committees, or consultants points to a lack of integration of marketing throughout the organization as well as a lack of a strategic marketing focus. While marketing certainly has become more accepted, it is still in its infancy at many institutions. Marketing is viewed as an excellent way to attract students and yet is not commonly seen as a way to increase student satisfaction, lower attrition, and develop strategic and competitive advantages in the marketplace.

This paper will explore the AACSB’s criteria for evaluating outside Ph.D.’s so that Deans can make informed decisions when hiring outside Ph.D.’s and so that Deans can counsel these faculty to insure they will eventually earn terminal degree status. © 1990 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Taking advantage of the aggregate data, we estimate a three-stage least squares model which takes retention, enrollment and SAT scores as all endogenous. Our results highlight interactions between the three endogenous variables which confirms our suspicion of the need for multiple equations. In addition, a variety, of specific results emerge, including the impact of interviews, ability, socioeconomic status, and the student-faculty ratio of the college. In general many of these results can be understood in terms of the human capital model in which the decision to continue depends on a weighing of the benefits against the full costs of college.

In order to successfully market a university, it is necessary to understand the factors involved in the student decision making process. It is also important for a university to understand how it is seen by its potential students on those factors that influence choice. This paper reports a study that was designed to examine several factors related to this problem. These include determining what factors influence student choice and how those factors compare for students at different types of institutions. Additionally, comparisons were made on the extent to which students believed these factors were present at various institutions. Finally, a comparison was made between perceived attributes and their actual presence. © 1994 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.","",""

"A content analytic approach to services advertising in India","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097365894&partnerID=40&md5=761d704c2d997dfee07d8170cc11230e","This study attempts to gauge the extent to which services advertisements in Indian magazines differ in terms of advertising styles and types of service. The findings suggest that services advertising styles differ across the service types considered, while the ‘documentation’ style or informative advertisements are predominant. The study concludes by offering managerial guidelines in terms of services advertising insights, especially to international services providers wishing to enter or expand in India. © 2010.

"K-Pop as (mis)representation of Korean culture","2022","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140016094&partnerID=40&md5=532cb1a4e86ed7c74349eeea5a503025","K-Pop, short for Korean popular music, is a genre that has grown into a global phenomenon over the last few decades, influencing not only the international music scene, but also social and cultural issues that extend beyond the realm of the music industry. Apart from the various academic studies regarding its model of success, its financial contribution to Korea’s economy, and the behavioral patterns of its fandom, K-Pop offers fertile ground for semiotic research, and harbors many aspects yet to be uncovered and further examined. The current article explores the issue of Korean cultural representation and misrepresentation through KPop, by examining the two diametrically opposed perspectives within the framework of history and cultural identity. The study suggests that the divergent vantage points between the proponents of each stance consist in their understanding and interpretation of culture itself. © 2022, International Journal of Marketing Semiotics and Discourse Studies.

"Pragmatic functions and interpersonal communication using emojis in WeChat by Chinese undergraduate students: a corpus-based study","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195085928&partnerID=40&md5=f39fe80c4dcbfc3c463aa2f03f996f63","Online chatting lacks live physical non-verbal interaction, causing communication difficulties and conflicts. Emojis (emoticons), a visual language that simulates non-verbal cues, are gaining popularity among young people, particularly Chinese students. However, few studies have used WeChat data to study their pragmatic functions. This study employs a qualitative research design, by drawing on chat-logs from 20 Chinese undergraduate students aged between 20-25 years old. Six pragmatic functions of emojis are found to be principally operative, namely attitude/ emotion signalling, speech act emotion signalling, attitude/emotion intensity enhancement, illocutionary force modification, joking, irony. This study sheds light on the profile of the users of emojis, while aiding the identification of the intended meaning of the sender. © (2023), (University of Kassel).

"The colonising effect: Marketisation and the discursive enactment of institutional identity on Ghanaian universities’ websites","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141136940&partnerID=40&md5=a5838cf436b369c8726b7a17df82fd73","The relationship between discourses of marketisation and the institutional discourses of higher education has been widely explored. The focus has been on discerning the ways whereby discourses of marketisation have come to colonise institutional discourses, and shape the identities, as well as the purposes of higher education institutions. A major research trend on the relationship between marketisation and higher education has been the reliance on promotional discourse genres. The literature on how marketisation has come to shape online institutional discourses in Ghana is scant. This study explores how the discourses of marketisation have shaped the types of identities that are enacted through the international students’ section on the websites of two leading institutions. The study draws on the dialectical relational approach to CDA (Fairclough, 2013), as the principal methodological and analytical framework. The findings show that the discourses of marketisation have colonised institutional discourses, thus greatly affecting institutions’ construal of instrumental, entrepreneurial and globalised identities. In addition, the paper explores how the verbal and visual modes were used in complementarity, in the performance of institutional discourses. The study concludes by arguing that higher education institutions in Ghana will have to construe identities that are more academically oriented. © 2021, International Journal of Marketing Semiotics and Discourse Studies.

"Amongst branding, design and architecture: a semiotic analysis of ING DIRECT's bank shops","2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097432437&partnerID=40&md5=d9e57219c0bc3896f85731db68a2833d","The purpose of this article is to analyze the discourse of ING DIRECT bank shops, that is bank branches with an original and attractive design that were established in Italy in 2011. What makes these places of consumption particularly interesting from a semiotic point of view is the fact that they are concept stores: physical spaces where the values and the characters of the brand are rendered tangible and where subjects may develop sensorial, cognitive and emotional relationships with the brand. On the one hand, this solution had a strong impact on the retail banking sector. However, on the other hand, it brought with it several risks in terms of brand identity and corporate identity; risks that a semiotic outlook can profitably uncover. With reference to the branches of Roma, Milano, Bergamo and Padova, and by shifting between descriptive and analytical moments, this paper addresses (i) the choices made on the expression plane which are responsible for creating the particular ambiance – the set of effects of meaning – that characterizes the bank shops; (ii) if, how and to what extent the bank has succeeded, through a specific architectural and design configuration, to substantiate the profound values that underlie its identity; (iii) if there is consistency between what the bank tells about itself and what it communicates through the spatial discourse of its branches. © 2010.

"The lexicon of Bekasi district’s semiofoodscape: between tradition and innovation","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195099144&partnerID=40&md5=02efa2eef2b228ee11258b12ce51a5c4","Food plays a vital role, not only as a means of sustenance, but also as a mode of communication. Traditional foods in traditional markets are facing challenges due to globalization. The revitalization of traditional markets as a food landscape has not received much attention from a communication perspective. This study draws on the concept of semiofoodscape that integrates language, food, society, and lexicography to examine the interaction between social actors and foodscape. The empirical research employs a convergent mixed methods research design, resulting in the development of a sensory lexicon comprising flavor and texture wheels. These wheels can serve as a sensory vocabulary in various research design settings. The importance of semiofoodscape in preserving traditional food and culture is discussed and future research avenues are outlined. © (2023), (University of Kassel).

"On the generic structure of managerial position job advertisements in tertiary education institutions","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141206676&partnerID=40&md5=3e1aec62927d7594ae6f0e8bf6c76231","Within the area of marketization of higher education in the last three decades, a key strand of research that continues to engage researchers concerns genres that are produced by universities themselves such as mission/vision statements, strategic plans, and job advertisements. Although there have been studies on job advertisements, very little attention has been given to the rhetoric of managerial positions’ job advertisements (MPJAs) of tertiary education institutions in Ghana. The present study, therefore, explores the generic structure of 30 MPJAs from ten tertiary education institutions that were published in the major public newspaper Daily Graphic, by utilizing a qualitative research design, facilitated by content analysis. The analysis was informed by Swales’ (1990) approach to genre analysis and Huttner’s (2010) genre-related typology. The study revealed that MPJAs of tertiary institutions adopted a five-move pattern (institution identification, vacancy declaration, job details, application details, and authority signing), with variations in some of the steps. These findings suggest that tertiary education institutions in Ghana construct their MPJAs in a similar fashion, although this may differ in other cultural contexts. The implications for scholarship on MPJAs and texts construction pedagogy are discussed. © 2022,Journal of Marketing Semiotics & Discourse Studies.

"The discursive construction of gender identities in Portuguese movie poster","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195071132&partnerID=40&md5=0c3f2cd12373361e17bfbb2027ed8e9b","This paper examines the normative construction of masculinity and femininity as portrayed in Portuguese movie posters. The study offers a reading of how these gender identities are crafted, informed by Kress and van Leeuwen’s grammar of visual design (2021). The analysis scrutinizes narrative, conceptual, interactive, compositional, and modality aspects. The dataset comprises six Portuguese movie posters. The findings indicate that the depiction of normative masculinity and femininity in these movie posters conforms to stereotypical gender traits commonly found in advertisements. Furthermore, if we consider Portuguese movie posters as a form of advertising textuality, their portrayal of masculine and feminine images is both aestheticized and idealized, aiming not only to attract moviegoers, but also to reinforce dominant ideological norms. © (2023), (University of Kassel).

"Branding industrial heritage in the wake of the cultural turn: the case of Santralistanbul","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163408706&partnerID=40&md5=6b2d7d45b17cf88273fc102b6d4bc924","This paper draws on a multidisciplinary framework by bringing heritage studies into focus from a cultural analytic point of view, also informed by relevant branding perspectives. It aims to examine how the advent of the cultural turn and the attendant economic and symbolic processes affect post-industrial landscapes to be repurposed and marketed in new ways. The old power plant of Silahtarağa, which was rebranded as Santralistanbul and transformed into a cultural space hosting the Museum of Energy, is studied within the scope of this paper to gain a deeper understanding of meanings, uses, and values as part of the broader social context. A social semiotic methodological avenue is pursued whereby the transformations undergone by the focal heritage site are addressed against the background of the three metafunctions, namely representational, organizational, and interactional, which are adapted from Halliday (1985) and applied to a museum setting through the multimodal framework developed by Ravelli and Heberle (2016). The paper begins with background information on the Silahtarağa Power plant and its transformation into Santralistanbul. It is followed by a literature review of the changes brought about by the cultural turn while reflecting on the relationship between industrial heritage and branding through cultural industries and the flagship projects that replaced heavy industries. After exposing the methodological framework, the multimodal semiotic analysis is applied to the case of the Museum of Energy. © 2023, International Journal of Marketing Semiotics and Discourse Studies.

"Marketisation of Ghanaian higher academic institutions: a hypermodal analysis of universities’ homepages","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097404240&partnerID=40&md5=05d24e6d599a14765eabcb33040bcf05","The marketisation of higher education continues to incite universities towards the adoption of vital promotional practices. As a result, the university homepage has gained much interest from scholars and researchers from various backgrounds, including discourse analysts. However, the bulk of the literature focuses on homepages of universities in Anglo-American and Asian-Pacific contexts, whereas research of African and, particularly, Ghanaian universities’ homepages remains scant. In addressing this gap, the present study investigated how selected Ghanaian universities project their corporate identities (CIs) to promote their products and services through the hypermodal resources (images, verbal resources, and navigational elements) on their institutional homepages by drawing on Kress and van Leeuwen's (2006) visual grammar model, and Zhang and O'Halloran’s (2012) hypermodal framework. The findings reveal that although Ghanaian universities portray their space as an intense academic environment, they tend to emphasise human resources rather than the existence of structural resources or facilities in representing their identities. In addition, the discoverability of information on the homepages was found to be low, with no overlaps between information sub-categories. The study, therefore, contributes to the scholarship on the marketisation of higher education and has practical implications for the design of universities’ homepages in Ghana and other jurisdictions.

"Consuming the scapegoat: Mass shootings as systemically necessary cultural trauma","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097136617&partnerID=40&md5=2cbd1f5ed04ff403554ccb0bfe21c176","Mass shootings constitute a recurrent and most violent phenomenon in the U.S. and elsewhere. This paper challenges the ready-made, solipsistically contained metanarratives on offer by mainstream media and formal institutions with regard to the psychological antecedents of the perpetrating social actors, while theorizing mass shootings as acts of violence that are systemically inscribed in the foundations of communities. These foundations abide by the logic of sacrifice which is propagated in instances of collective traumatism. It is argued that the cultural trauma that emanates from events of mass shootings, inasmuch as the commemorative events that are performed on regular occasions, constitute re-enactments of the death drive that sustains communities. The cultural analytic deploys against a CDA reading of longitudinal studies on mass shootings, coupled with psychoanalytic discourse analysis, prior to submitting mass shootings to a deconstructive line of reasoning as systemically necessary transcendental violence. Ultimately, it is shown that the intertextual institutional chain that informs the mediatized representation of this social phenomenon merely attains to obliterate and, hence, to propagate cultural traumatism and the sacrificial logic that underpins it. The terms micrometanarrative, parafunction and expropriating ipseity are introduced and operationalized in this context. © 2020.

Using interviews and applying Grounded Theory, this study offers a description regarding managers’ 1) perceptions of what makes a hardcore manager as against a casual one; 2) motivations to participate in FPL at hardcore levels; 3) media usage; 4) the impact FPL has on their consumption of the sport and its products; and 5) the marketability of specific players. Subsequently, we develop an understanding of international FPL hardcore managers’ consumption behaviour. This understanding helps teams, marketers, and sponsors both directly and indirectly to establish a more effective reach to this growing psychographic group. Moreover, it contributes to the body of knowledge of cultural consumer research. © 2023, International Journal of Marketing Semiotics and Discourse Studies.

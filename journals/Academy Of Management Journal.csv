"NAVIGATING THE PARADOX OF PROMISE THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION OF MEANINGFUL CAREER NARRATIVES","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181230355&doi=10.5465%2famj.2021.0292&partnerID=40&md5=875dd6132235b64872bc3996ca70436a","Working with a prominent mentor can offer many benefits to one’s career: mentors provide skills, resources, and values that leave a lasting imprint. Yet, these promising starting points also present a puzzle as people make sense of their careers further on: they must acknowledge their association with their prominent mentor, without being overshadowed by them. We refer to this tension as the paradox of promise. Through a qualitative study of former employees at the Eames Office, we examine how individuals navigate the paradox of promise as they construct retrospective career narratives. We find that individuals narrate their formative experience as imprints, but with two distinct emphases—values-dominant imprints versus skills-dominant imprints. Individuals then narrate their later career experiences by reprinting, reinforcing the existing meaning or finding new meaning in relation to their imprint; we induced three reprinting practices: (a) embracing values, (b) contrasting values, and (c) supplanting values. Using imprints and reprinting, former Eames employees crafted overarching sources of career meaningfulness: belongingness narratives, emphasizing collaboration and contribution with others; self-expression narratives, emphasizing authenticity and freedom; and achievement narratives, emphasizing expertise and accomplishment. Our study contributes to interpretive perspectives of career success and mentor relationships, and how meaningfulness is constructed over the career.

"ON THE PLURALITY AND POLITICS OF ALLY WORK: LIBERALISM AND SELF, RELATIONAL, AND ORGANIZATIONAL ALLY WORK","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159357973&doi=10.5465%2famj.2021.0999&partnerID=40&md5=feaa6bfa51b0c43b8c51a7d273b41923","We theorize that ally work (actions by employees belonging to advantaged social groups to support employees belonging to disadvantaged social groups) can be organized into three modalities: self ally work that is oriented toward developing skills and capabilities, relational ally work that is focused on building positive work relationships, and organizational ally work aimed at changing organizational practices to support disadvantaged coworkers. Drawing from the theory of political ideology as motivated cognition, across multiple pre-registered field studies we found that employees who were more liberal-leaning (vs. conservative-leaning) reported higher engagement in all three modalities. We also examined whether contextual affordances amplified the liberalism effect. Specifically, we tested whether personal accountability for diversity, colleague diversity, and organizational ideology directed liberals toward greater engagement in self, relational, and organizational work, respectively. As hypothesized, more liberal-leaning employees reported higher engagement in organizational ally work in more ideologically liberal organizations. However, the hypothesized effects of personal accountability were not supported. Notably, personal accountability had a positive effect on self ally work among more conservative-leaning employees. The moderating effects of colleague diversity were also mixed across studies. Highlighting both the plurality and politics of ally work, we discuss theoretical and practical implications of our findings. © 2023 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""
"ON THE STATUS SHOCKS OF TOURNAMENT RITUALS: HOW RITUAL ENACTMENT AFFECTS PRODUCTIVITY, INPUT PROVISION, AND PERFORMANCE","2023","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138329451&doi=10.5465%2famj.2020.0585&partnerID=40&md5=38515200a91b4cb2a67745cda9a60bc1","We propose a novel process through which status shocks may enhance performance. Specifically, we theorize that, when status shocks include a ritualistic conferment of social prestige—such as in the case of “tournament rituals”—participating in that ritual enactment may increase tournament winners’ productivity and improve the inputs they receive, thereby improving their overall performance. We also consider the duration of that performance improvement, finding a decay that is consistent with our theorized mechanisms that are based on emotional energy. Our study shows that status shocks may carry not only informational value, as signals of quality, but also symbolic and social value that change the behavior of individuals who receive these shocks and of the input providers with whom they interact. We employ difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity designs on game-level data from the National Basketball Association to provide causal evidence for our hypotheses. © 2023 Academy of Management.

This analytical predisposition overlooks the possible roles of social network sites (SNSs) such as Facebook and Instagram. These online platforms enable a cohabitation of different audiences—that is, a context collapse that allows a growing, invisible audience to easily access information about one’s stigma. In our qualitative analysis in a Latin American organization, we develop a model that documents the everyday dynamics of context collapse among gay male employees. In a disclosure dilemma, employees are uncertain about how to be a professional online and simultaneously keep SNSs as platforms where they can show more relaxed versions of themselves. As a response, most employees adopt mirroring, and attempt to reflect their face-to-face disclosure levels on SNSs. Some employees engage in destigmatization efforts online, and as an outlier case we mapped an employee in collapse denial. Our study questions the established idea of disclosure as a relatively controlled process in microinteractions. We also nuance the assumption of SNSs as safe spaces and show the unintended impacts of context collapse on the stigmatized. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""
"MEDIA COVERAGE OF FIRMS IN THE PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE SIGNALS: A CONFIGURATIONAL APPROACH","2024","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192726666&doi=10.5465%2famj.2020.1791&partnerID=40&md5=d50e691fc4a3f952536f0341503bfe23","Recent management research suggests that firms try to orchestrate conformity and distinctiveness in their behavior to reconcile opposing demands of norm compliance and competitive distinction in order to appear optimally distinct. Whether they succeed or not depends on how audiences perceive the multiple signals they elicit. Extant literature has not fully uncovered how the media combine these different signals to form a representation of firms’ behavior and their subsequent reactions to these combinations. We adopt a configurational approach to address this gap in the environmental sustainability context. Drawing on unique proprietary data on 118 cases in the energy utility industry and using fsQCA, we determine that different equifinal signal configurations are associated with positive media coverage regarding environmental behavior or the lack thereof. We then generate five patterns of signals that explain media reactions and disentangle the underlying logics behind them. Our study adds to the research on the multifaceted nature of signal (in)congruence perception by discussing the role of conformity and distinctiveness and highlighting that this perception depends on the signals’ credibility. Delivering a balanced orchestration of conformity and distinctiveness signals is possible, but complex, because audiences tend to penalize incongruent postures they cannot associate with a given category. © 2024 Academy of Management.

In the present study, we integrate conservation of resources theory, the crossover model, and the relative contribution model to understand the influence of perceived organizational support during reentry on both mothers' and their significant others' home stress and, ultimately, workplace experiences. Beyond actor effects, we investigate the relationship between each parent's perceived organizational support on their partner's home stress via three crossover mechanisms: (a) direct, (b) indirect, (c) shared stressor. Notably, we offer a theoretically novel lens through which to view the shared-stressor mechanism. Drawing upon the relative contribution model, we conceptualize dual-earner parents as a team and argue that because mothers are the critical members during this period, their resources will directly influence both parents' home stress. Findings yielded by this multistage, multisource field study demonstrate the importance of supporting mothers as critical members of the family during reentry, as organizational support that is perceived as inadequate directly affects home stress and indirectly influences workplace experiences that can impede successful transitions and threaten career outcomes for both parents. © 2023 Academy of Management.

Building on research on resilience, resourcefulness, and crisis management, we induce a process model that unpacks the mechanisms and dynamics that enable organizations to act resiliently. We find that organizations approach adversity using two types of resourcefulness. Promotive resourcefulness focuses on opportunities from adversity, which leads to acting resiliently. We show how promotive resourcefulness becomes sustained over time by endogenously producing resources-crisis agency, trust, and hopefulness-which expands an organization's identity and leads to resilient acts. In contrast, preventative resourcefulness focuses on minimizing worst-case outcomes, which leads to a lost organizational identity and relatively weak adversity adjustment. We find that preventative resourcefulness becomes part of cycles that erode trust, limit crisis agency, and generate hopelessness. Additionally, we explain how financial, emotional, and operational updating can shift preventative to promotive resourcefulness, allowing organizations to act resiliently later in a crisis. Our findings unpack critical mechanisms and processes that explain whether and how organizations act resiliently over time. © 2024 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

Based on Park and Sturman’s PFP perception framework, we integrated two motivation theories—transactional theory of stress and role engagement theory—to delineate two countervailing mechanisms that explain how individuals appraise and react to perceived PFP. Our research considers employees’ perception of PFP-I (perceived PFP based on individual performance) and highlights leader competence and warmth as critical contingencies. We propose that perceived PFP-I is appraised by employees as a challenge when leader competence is higher, which leads to employees’ work engagement and enhanced task performance, but is appraised as a threat when leader warmth is lower, which leads to employees’ work withdrawal and decreased task performance. In two three-wave survey studies, we found support for our model. The present research advances our knowledge regarding the incentive effect of PFP-I by emphasizing the importance of perceived PFP-I and proposing a new way of seeing employee motivation and performance ensuing from perceived PFP-I through the lenses of stress and role (dis)engagement. Our findings provide insights into how organizations and leaders can effectively utilize PFP to motivate employees. © 2023 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

Drawing on the acculturation literature, we classify the patterns of dual identities based on membership in nation and organization into four identity profiles: (a) diffuse (weak national and organizational identification), (b) national (strong national and weak organizational identification), (c) organizational (weak national and strong organizational identification), and (d) integrated (strong national and organizational identification). We submit that perceived conflict between the dual identities renders MNEs’ host country managers less likely to present the integrated and the organizational identity profiles and more likely to present the national identity profile than domestic firm managers. MNEs’ host country managers also identify more strongly with their nation and less strongly with their organization than domestic firm managers do. The combination of strong national identification and weak organizational identification among MNEs’ host country managers exposes them to greater acculturative stress within foreign organizations. The results of an analysis of a sample of 843 Korean managers working in 19 Korean firms and 60 MNE subsidiaries in Korea corroborate our hypotheses.

Screen displays, forecasts, simulations, indicators, multidimensional models, figures, and images are increasingly central to work of all kinds. Representations are simultaneously transparent and opaque. They contain and reveal information about the organization. Yet, they conceal the computational work used to convert data about the physical world into abstract depictions. Computational opacity is consequential when representations become misaligned with the physical world they depict. We examine how computational opacity can be breached. Drawing on an ethnography of a machine-shop, we show how operators develop practical computational literacy skills—the capacity to visualize and talk about physical objects and processes independent of them; to translate this noncomputational thinking and talking into computational symbols, syntax, structure, and assumptions; and to create computational solutions. Operators develop this skill vicariously, observing programmers as they solve problems. We contribute to understanding how those without programming capacities may decrease their dependence on programmers and increase their capacity to create and alter representations of the physical world.

Yet, little is known about how investors infer such gendered preferences and when they are particularly likely to do so. Integrating insights from third-party bias research with social role theory, we posit that when women propose novel ventures, investors are more apt to make unpromising social approval forecasting—an anticipation of the extent to which other investors will endorse these ventures—and thus withhold funding support. This is because the intensified gender role violations due to women being entrepreneurial in tandem with being novel lead investors to impose harsher judgments that these ventures violate normative business practices. Our hypotheses receive support from results of three methodologically complementary studies, including an archival study of Shark Tank (2009–2019) coupled with preregistered online and field experiments. By casting light on how venture novelty, a key determining factor of entrepreneurial success, makes third-party bias against women particularly salient, our work identifies a less overt “entrepreneurial gender dilemma” and derives new insights into policy-making designed to help women entrepreneurs surmount financial and social barriers in the innovation-based economy.

To better understand how a corporate office affects business unit search, we focus on the role of corporate proximity (hierarchical, geographic, and cognitive) between the corporate office and constituent units. We argue that corporate proximity improves a business unit’s local search process through two mechanisms—vertical linkages and corporate attention—that positively condition the likelihood of persisting; that is, reentering a product market after having experienced a prior product failure in that market. We find support for our theory using data on reentry in the U.S. medical device industry following exit from the market due to product failure. We also explore how age of the product market and characteristics of the failure—cause and severity—further moderate corporate proximity’s role in business unit reentry.

Yet, customers frequently reside in organizations, and organizational members may not be aligned in their views regarding the benefits an innovation offers. Decision-making within organizations is rarely under the purview of a single executive and various members can wield influence. Given this plurality, how do entrepreneurial firms gain organizational adoption for their innovations? I explore how 54 entrepreneurial firms, all participating in a digital health accelerator, attempted to gain organizational adoption for their innovations. I show that, when entrepreneurs pursued an embedded process, they developed ways to expand the relevance of their innovations for new customers through new use cases, but strategically paced and withheld disruptive aspects of their innovations to appease different audiences within customer organizations. Firms that leveraged a market-centric process also expanded the relevance of their innovations. Despite sparking the interest of executives, firms using a market-centric approach did not gain adoption. By unpacking the process by which some entrepreneurs discovered how to strategically pace the deployment of their digital innovations, I contribute a mechanism that explains how digital innovations gain organizational adoption.

Despite these negative epistemic emotions, and motivated by a heightened sense of moral duty, professionals engage in service-oriented practices of collegial and humanistic work that depart from the knowledge-centric practices of their usual work.We detail how the repeated development of positive moral emotions when performing such practices leads professionals to ultimately consolidate and embed service-oriented practices in their professional work.

In this paper, I propose that colleague exits can shape employees’ careers through the creation of valuable relational “vacancies.” Focusing on employees engaged in collaborative research, and drawing on the vacancy chains literature, I argue that colleague exits create new collaboration opportunities for remaining employees that can enhance learning and facilitate competency-driven promotion. Yet, employees will benefit only when these opportunities arise as a result of their own collaborators leaving—that is, employees must lose to gain. Using longitudinal data on employees within a single research organization, I show that collaborator exits increase the likelihood of employees’ competency-driven promotion in a way that noncollaborator exits do not. Furthermore, it is the exit of higher-level collaborators that is most beneficial.

Studies have typically considered certain responses and focused on established decision rules to examine search directions, thereby, implicitly assuming that all responses considered are workable solutions to performance shortfalls. Conversely, we argue that variations in decision-makers’ beliefs about the effectiveness of particular responses in improving firm performance play an important role. These beliefs, alongside evidence supporting them, determine which specific responses firms adopt. To test this argument, we focus on two types of search solutions represented by research and development (R&D) intensity and philanthropic donation intensity. Based on 2009–2018 data collected from publicly listed Chinese firms, we find that, when decision-makers agree on the effectiveness of R&D, the positive relationship between performance shortfalls and R&D intensity strengthens; whereas when they agree on the effectiveness of corporate social responsibility (CSR), the negative relationship between performance shortfalls and donation intensity weakens. The effects of shared beliefs on the effectiveness of R&D and CSR are stronger when they are supported by relevant evidence—that is, when there is a stronger correlation between R&D or CSR on the one hand and firm performance on the other. © 2024 Academy of Management.

We theorize that this stems from an interplay between organizations’ idea selection and the external generation of ideas: an organization selects ideas shared by external contributors, and the external contributors, who strive to see their ideas selected, use the prior selection to infer what kind of ideas the organization is looking for, and to respond. Contributors whose ideas are misaligned with the organization’s selection tend to stop submitting ideas (i.e., self-selection) or adjust the ideas they submit so that they correspond (i.e., self-adjustment), resulting in a less diverse pool of ideas. Our central hypothesis is that the more consistent organizations are in their selection, the stronger the coevolutionary lock-in: organizations with greater selection consistency receive future ideas with lower content variety. We find support for these predictions by combining large-scale network analysis and natural language processing across a large number of organizations that use crowdsourcing. Our findings suggest a reconceptualization of external search as a two-way street: organizations are not simply passive receivers of ideas but send signals that shape the pool of ideas that externals share. © 2024 Academy of Management.

Past research has highlighted the value for hybrids in recruiting board members representing different logics to avoid attentional drifts; yet, diverse boards have also been prone to conflicts that occasion attentional lapses, thereby jeopardizing these organizations’ pursuit of multiple goals. We draw on a longitudinal comparative case study of five work integration social enterprises with institutionally diverse boards to uncover an integrative model of hybrid governance consisting of a protective board structure and relational leadership processes that, together, prevent distracting cognitive and emotional conflicts and foster attentional engagement of both the board and senior managers to multiple goals. The protective board structure prevents shifts in board composition and ensures the enshrined representation of the organization’s logics. Relational leadership processes—which help board members relate to each other, with the organization’s mission, and with senior managers—include enculturation processes (i.e., interventions to reduce the cognitive and emotional gap between institutionally diverse board members) and bridging processes (i.e., interventions to facilitate communication and alignment between the board and senior managers in the decision-making process).

Further, we position authenticity as a continuum, as individuals may temper their gender expression to elicit acceptance and express a gender that feels “authentic enough” as they contend with the impact of prevailing gender norms and expectations in the workplace. Finally, the findings suggest that the identity transition process evolves in a nonlinear way and involves a dynamic interplay between the desire to express one’s gender in a way that feels authentic and the desire to feel accepted by others. © 2023 Academy of Management.

Not only have scholars emphasized novelty as a necessity, but they have almost considered it a sufficient condition for performance. Challenging this assumption, we hypothesize that novelty can produce high performance only in combination with specific configurations that feature other value drivers, such as efficiency, lock-in, and complementarity, which help firms not only create value but also capture more of it. Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis of two samples of Internet-enabled firms largely supports our hypotheses. We find that novelty alone is insufficient for high performance, even when it appears as a necessary condition for very high performance in new technological environments. Our results highlight how novelty combines effectively with other value drivers (in particular with efficiency) and strategies (in particular with differentiation) contingent on the intensity of competition, firm size, and firms’ technological environment.

Applying our approach to 1,620 retail stores over 22 months, we show that modeling exit events as a dynamic and interdependent system adds to our ability to predict subsequent human capital outflow. Dismissals had the weakest total effect on subsequent voluntary turnover, layoff announcements had the strongest and most immediate effects, and voluntary turnovers had moderate but lasting effects.We also find that these three exit reasons each exhibit a distinct pattern of subsequent turnover intensity and longevity. Based on characteristics of work units in our setting, our results correspond to a cumulative worker-level average effect of 0.17 quits following dismissals, 0.23 quits following quits, and 2.2 quits following a layoff. We find that these ""multiplier"" effects are concentrated among workers of similar performance: high performer exits beget high performer quits, just as low-performer exits beget lowperformer quits. Our findings suggest analyses offering individual-level estimates of turnover will generally underestimate the broader,work-unit level consequences of individual exit events on similar workers. © 2023 Academy of Management.

Leader–member exchange (LMX) theory and research have suggested that leader–follower relationships develop, mature, and then stabilize. Integrating recent work that has found important and impactful within-individual variations in what was thought to be relatively unvarying relationships, we theorize that leader–follower relationships (like other linkage types), are not only differentiated (varying between people) but also fluctuate across time periods (varying within people). We also discuss how people can understand their relationships better by comparing them to a relevant and proximal referent; this underlines how prior levels of LMX serve as a lens by which followers evaluate their current LMX. Across two studies, we discuss how comparing this week’s LMX to last week’s LMX can signal improvement (i.e., gains) or deterioration (i.e., losses) in the relationship, with differential implications for positive and negative affect. We also provide additional insights into LMX fluctuations by contrasting within- and between-individual variance in established and newly founded relationships, and by examining those incidents that are more likely to influence LMX in a given week.

In an attempt to resolve this equivocality, scholars have suggested that status hierarchy may play a role, proposing that status differences can constrict team-level information sharing in diverse teams by privileging the knowledge of higher-status members and discounting the knowledge of lower-status members. Although there is some evidence to support this notion, there is also evidence to suggest that status differences may amplify information sharing in diverse teams by offering status enhancement incentives to members who share unique knowledge. In this paper, we reconcile these different predictions by suggesting that the effects of status hierarchy on the relationship between knowledge diversity and team information sharing will depend on the stability of the hierarchy. Using a diverse sample of 156 teams across 110 organizations, we found that status differences constricted information sharing in knowledge-diverse teams when hierarchy stability was high and amplified information sharing in knowledge-diverse teams when hierarchy stability was low. These information sharing effects, in turn, affected team performance. Our study highlights how hierarchy stability is critical for understanding whether status differences constrict or amplify information sharing in knowledge-diverse teams.

By conjuring visual snapshots of the future, leaders paint a portrait of what their organizations can one day achieve. It would thus stand to reason that leaders who naturally think and speak in terms of picture-like detail (a “concrete orientation”) would promote more organizational change than those who are inclined to think vaguely (an “abstract orientation”). Yet, research has established that individuals with a concrete orientation tend to focus on short-term, narrow details (e.g., small features of a single product) rather than long-term visions requiring the coordinated effort of all employees. To determine how and when concrete-thinking leaders induce large-scale change, we integrate theory on attention, organizational hierarchy, and construal. We predict that leaders who have a concrete orientation will promote change by redirecting their attention toward long-term visions of the future, if their organizations have strong, rather than weak, hierarchies. By contrast, hierarchical strength will have no such effect on leaders with an abstract orientation. We test these predictions in an archival study of CEOs and then examine the attention-based process that helps explain this effect in a preregistered experiment. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

However, individuals capitalize in the context of workplace relationships that serve instrumental functions, pointing to the possibility that the process of capitalization may at times be instrumental as well. In this paper, we integrate theory on capitalization with the social-functionalist model of emotions to develop a model that explains how workplace interpersonal capitalization serves the instrumental function of spurring knowledge sharing. We identify pride as a linking mechanism between workplace interpersonal capitalization and knowledge sharing, and we argue that experiencing pride is contingent on employees disclosing positive events that they attribute to their own efforts. We also identify perceived coworker responsiveness as a boundary condition qualifying the association between pride and knowledge sharing.

Yet, why does Maoism continue to have an impact on the behavior of Party members? In this study, we argue that, although the influence of Maoist ideology has become weaker among younger Party members and Party members with higher educational attainment, such ideological decay is countered by a process of secondhand ideological imprinting. Based on data from 1, 298 non-state-owned Chinese listed firms for 2000-2017, we find that firms with Party-member board chairs file fewer patent applications and are more likely to commit patent infringement. These effects are weaker if a board chair is younger or has higher educational attainment. Importantly, the moderating effect of young age is reduced as the presence of older Party-member corporate directors in a region becomes more prominent. However, the moderating effect of education appears to be unaffected by the presence of older Party-member directors. These findings generate fresh insights on the dynamics of ideological decay and persistence. © 2023 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

Analyzing data from historical archives, interviews, and observations, we use both qualitative and quantitative methods to reveal how the endurance of an elite category is an ongoing cultural accomplishment that occurs via periodic redefinition of its “symbolic boundary”-that is, the set of meanings and practices that distinguish the elite from nonelite. Modeling the boundary in terms of semiotic codes of opposition, we find that the encoding of the symbolic boundary serves as a temporary settlement that conveys both the category's elite exclusivity and its cultural consonance with broader societal beliefs, tastes, and practices. Over time, however, with industry and societal changes, tensions erupt in the balance between the needs for exclusivity and consonance, propelling a redefinition of what it means to be elite. Our research extends current theorizations of elite category endurance by revealing how the elite symbolic boundary is neither permanent nor unassailable; rather, we show how it changes to enable long-term elite category endurance. © 2023 Academy of Management.

We argue the coherence of a firm’s crisis management strategy—the degree to which its elements fit together consistently and logically—plays an important but previously unconsidered role in shareholder trust repair. We utilize multiple methods to abductively develop and test our theory. First, we conduct a qualitative comparative analysis of 51 cases of financial misconduct among S&P 1500 firms that disclosed a misstatement via press release and dismissed either the CEO or CFO within 90 days of the disclosure. Analyzing aspects of these firms’ crisis communication and the type of dismissal executed, this study reveals four configurations that highlight the influence of crisis management (in)coherence on shareholder trust. Second, a policy-capturing study examines the underlying mechanisms that drive shareholders’ perceptions and intended behaviors relative to manipulated crisis management strategies in a controlled setting.

We analyze unique field data obtained from a job-matching mobile-application platform for startups, finding the hypothesized gender gap and showing that women, but not men, are sensitive to information about organizational gender composition, especially for startups signaling “diversity debt”—that is, no or only a token representation of women. A preregistered experiment further reveals that women’s identity threat concerns mediate these effects. Gender disparities in startups are reproduced in a vicious cycle as existing underrepresentation deters women from applying.

We conducted a qualitative study of 73 Tanzanian participants who had both a self-employed work role and a family planning counselor community role.

We challenge this agnostic assumption by putting the first organizational founding into a specific spatiotemporal context and revealing the role of provisional spaces, defined as small-scale, easily accessible settings where market pioneers temporarily experiment with applications of an innovation before dedicated organizations emerge. We theorize that provisional spaces disseminate necessary information about an innovation and enable potential entrepreneurs to envision a new template for organizing. Therefore, geographic communities with a higher number of provisional spaces are more likely to host the first organization embodying a new form sooner than others. Using archival data on all movie-showing venues in Chicago communities, 1896–1927, we find empirical support for our theorizing. Community variance in volume and types of provisional spaces for movie projectors, such as opera houses and penny arcades, led to community-level differences in the emergence of distinct movie theater forms: nickelodeon, movie house, and movie palace.

Through an inductive qualitative study of a French antiterrorist unit, we move beyond dyadic treatments of interpersonal trust repair to theorize a model that elucidates the organizational practices that can be used to guide members through the trust repair process. We also induce core mechanisms, such as establishing trust violation rules and providing trust templates, that explain why these organizational practices work to repair interpersonal trust. We suggest how this organizationally directed trust repair process can lead to full, partial, or failed trust repair for trust violators, with consequences on whether and how these violators may be reintegrated into the organization.

Focusing on the media’s essential role in scandalizing misconduct, we take a media routines perspective to theorize how the status of past transgressors inside and outside the focal transgressor’s industry creates different contexts that shape the likelihood of scandalization. We argue that the prevalence of past transgressions by high-status firms within the industry leads journalists to scrutinize the misconduct more, amplifying the effect of the focal firm’s status by highlighting its commonalities with past transgressors. Conversely, the prevalence of transgressions by high-status firms outside the industry attenuates the firm status effect on scandalization by directing media attention outside the industry, limiting the information that can be inferred from firm status. Past transgressors’ status and their categorical proximity to current transgressors serve as boundary conditions for the scandalizing effect of status.

Specifically, we show how working through governance obstacles-that is, coordinating and collaborating challenges arising from a multistakeholder governance approach to responding to grand challenges-can erode actors' ability to mitigate these wicked problems. We illustrate this process through an in-depth case study of WaterHealthOrg, a multistakeholder initiative established to address degrading water health in Australia's critical Great Barrier Reef region. Our findings reveal how, in an effort to avoid group paralysis or dissolution, actors employ specific practices to address governance obstacles. By doing so, actors set off a cumulative self-reinforcing process, driving them to consolidate rather than critically reflect on and adapt their collective response. Drawing on these insights, we develop a conceptual process model of how efforts to manage multistakeholder governance obstacles can generate governance traps that shape participants' ability to collectively respond and, ultimately, mitigate grand challenges. © 2023 Academy of Management.

Research has indicated that employees in lower-power positions are best poised to challenge leaders, because these individuals better understand others' perspectives and have a different lens on day-to-day organizational issues compared to powerful leaders. While several well-known leaders rely on a lower-power employee (i.e., right-hand partner) to amplify their efforts, it is unclear how one becomes a right-hand partner or what this entails. Relying on qualitative data from 74 individuals (61 chiefs of staff and 13 leaders), we develop a process of heedful challenging: the process of presenting alternative perspectives to someone in an individualized manner. In this process, the lower-power employee utilizes their knowledge of the leader and their understanding of how organizational issues are impacting employees to thoughtfully challenge the leader by presenting differing perspectives and illuminating the implications of their behavior. We articulate how one becomes a right-hand partner through this process, present the defining characteristics and drawbacks of being a right-hand partner, and describe instances when this process goes awry. This work contributes to theory about unequal-power relationships and provides insight into howlower-power employees can broaden leader's perspectives. © 2024 Academy of Management.

In seeking technology adoption, organizations thus must find amiddle ground between professional autonomy and managerial goals. Extant scholarship has examined such middle grounds but has focused on adoptions of specific technologies.However, amid broad technology adoption pressures-expectations on organizations lacking precise prescriptions, success criteria, and sanctions-novel middle-ground approaches might emerge. Our 16-month ethnography of a Finnish school indicates that intraprofessional segmentation-specialization of work tasks within a professional community-can allow organizations to navigate technology adoption while balancing professional autonomy and managerial goals. This segmentation supported managers' and certain teachers' enthusiasm about new technologies at work, without undermining other teachers' autonomy. This segmentation emerged, persisted, and intensified through two processes. First, it emerged through differentiating practices,which allowed a divergence ofwhat teachers said and did regarding technology. Second, this segmentation persisted and intensified through reinforcing practices, which furthered differentiation by formalizing, reorganizing, and strengthening it. Our study contributes to scholarship on occupations and technology by showing how intraprofessional segmentation can help organizations align technology with professional work amid broad technology adoption pressures. © 2024 Academy of Management.

Drawing on research on AI–human collaboration, job design, and employee creativity, we examine AI assistance in the form of a sequential division of labor within organizations: in a task, AI handles the initial portion, which is well-codified and repetitive, and employees focus on the subsequent portion, involving higher-level problem-solving. First, we provide causal evidence from a field experiment conducted at a telemarketing company. We find that AI assistance in generating sales leads, on average, increases employees’ creativity in answering customers’ questions during subsequent sales persuasion. Enhanced creativity leads to increased sales. However, this effect is much more pronounced for higher-skilled employees. Next, we conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with the employees. We found that AI assistance changes job design by intensifying employees’ interactions with more serious customers. This change enables higher-skilled employees to generate innovative scripts and develop positive emotions at work, which are conducive to creativity. By contrast, with AI assistance, lower-skilled employees make limited improvements to scripts and experience negative emotions at work. We conclude that employees can achieve AI-augmented creativity, but this desirable outcome is skill-biased by favoring experts with greater job skills. © 2024 Academy of Management.

Such coalition-based advocacy is largely driven by women, which has led to debate about whether men’s involvement as allies can help. Integrating literatures on signaling and legitimacy, we propose that the demographic composition of a gender equity advocacy coalition matters: men-only groups lack “coalition legitimacy,” or the perception that they are the “right” spokespersons for gender equity issues, whereas women-only groups struggle to convey “issue legitimacy,” or the perception that gender equity is of strategic importance within business organizations. By contrast, mixed-gender coalitions signal both forms of legitimacy, and are thus uniquely effective. We demonstrate these effects over three studies: managers reporting on advocacy coalitions comprising their colleagues (Study 1), an audio-based study showing that the proposed effects are unique for gender equity issues (Study 2), and a stimulus sampling study involving multiple policy proposals (Study 3). Our findings highlight the different forms of legitimacy that women and men bring to the table when selling gender equity issues.

We explore how anticipated image risk (i.e., individuals’ beliefs that the act of leading might harm their image with others) and lay beliefs about leadership ability (i.e., that this ability is fixed versus malleable) may diminish individuals’ endorsement of a leader identity and thus their leadership emergence. Across MBA consulting teams, supervisor–employee dyads, and virtual workers, we find that lay theories of leadership ability moderate the negative relationship between anticipated image risk in leadership and leader-identity endorsement, which affects subsequent leadership emergence (Study 1). Using qualitative survey data, Study 2 identifies three specific image concerns that individuals associated with leading: seeming bossy, seeming unqualified, and seeming different from one’s peers. Study 3 tests whether a newly developed measure of three specific image risks similarly predicts leader-identity endorsement and emergence. Last, in Study 4 we experimentally manipulate the anticipation of image risk to show its causal impact on leader-identity endorsement and emergence. © 2023 Academy of Management.

I draw on evolutionary life history theory, which proposes that growing up in a poorer versus wealthier environment impacts the sense of control people feel when exposed to threat in adulthood. I integrate this perspective with transactional stress theory to propose that job insecurity has a disproportionately negative effect on employees from poorer backgrounds, leading to lower engagement and higher emotional exhaustion among such employees, while those from wealthier backgrounds are buffered against these effects. These responses to job insecurity, in turn, amplify job loss risk for employees from poorer backgrounds, regardless of employees' current job or financial situation. A preregistered, multisource, five-wave longitudinal study conducted at the height of the COVID-19 crisis in India found support for these predictions. A follow-up quasiexperiment conducted in India and the United States replicated the effects on engagement and exhaustion. The impact of job insecurity on well-being is stratified and acts as amechanism that reproduces childhood inequalities. © 2024 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

Research has proposed that progressive role expansion—starting one’s career specialized in a single work role and later expanding into new work roles—would be helpful to navigate this challenge. However, we propose that when women engage in lateral role expansion within professional careers, they face a “glass wall”—an invisible barrier that limits their work opportunities due to a gendered evaluation of role expansion. Specifically, role expansion by female (vs. male) freelancers is seen as less agentic, and such difference undermines female freelancers’ perceived competence and commitment. Three studies using different methods (archival data and experiment), industries (music and film), and samples (Korean and American) show that female (vs. male) freelancers who expand into new work roles are seen as less agentic and have less chance of finding new work opportunities. Although women who pursue careers outside of organizations may become unshackled from gender biases embedded within traditional organizational hierarchies, we suggest that they still face obstacles in the new forms of work.

On the demand side, we propose that audience ambiguity and commitment concerns regarding cross-category moves limit the potential compensation of industry-changing executives. On the supply side, we argue that executives might accept smaller monetary rewards in exchange for acquiring experience in a new domain. Since category status also affects audience evaluations of candidates and candidates' desire to affiliate with a specific social category, we further hypothesize that both demand and supply mechanisms aremoderated by status differences between an executive's origin and destination industries. Our analysis of voluntary mobility and compensation patterns of S&P 1500 executives supports these arguments: industry-changing executives realize lower compensation than closely matched within-industry movers. As expected, the compressing effect of changing industry on compensation is contingent upon status differences across industries. Executives who transition to higher-status industries face more stringent compensation discounts, while those moving to lower-status industries experience similar compensation variation as within-industry movers. Our study advances category and status-attainment research by incorporating the influence of industry prestige on career outcomes of cross-category moves, while casting light on the individual consequences of executivemobility. © 2024 Academy of Management.

We further investigate an alternative remedy, or organizational frame, that may mitigate retaliation against higher-powered female moral objectors, finding that using this frame increases perceptions of self-control and reduces retaliation.

We take a person-centered theoretical approach to examine configurations of demands and resources that are sufficient to produce exhaustion, engagement, and other strain outcomes. Using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis across three studies, we find three equifinal configurations sufficient to produce exhaustion: (a) high workload and emotional demands, (b) low social support, and (c) high workload and low autonomy. We also find evidence for causal asymmetry in both exhaustion and engagement. Our person-centered approach yields more theoretically consistent results compared to a variable-centered approach. The findings highlight that certain job demands may only be buffered by specific resources, and that certain configurations of demands cannot be buffered at all.

Prior work has investigated rhetoric that emphasizes diversity in organizations is necessarily beneficial (value-in-diversity rhetoric), which is puzzling given the reality that diversity can have positive or negative consequences.We introduce the construct of contingent-diversity rhetoric, which emphasizes that diversity is beneficial if its challenges are overcome, and thus captures the reality of diversity's effects. Drawing from the psychology of the self, we theorize that leaders use contingent-diversity rhetoric less commonly than value-in-diversity rhetoric, due to fear of appearing prejudiced. Drawing from the psychology of employee motivation, we theorize that contingent-diversity rhetoric results in more diversity effort among employees than value-in-diversity rhetoric does because contingent rhetoric increases perceptions that diversity goals are difficult to achieve. Four multimethod studies support the proposed descriptive-prescriptive paradox: contingent-diversity rhetoric is descriptively less common, but prescriptively more effective, than value-in-diversity rhetoric.

However, managers often resist such initiatives. Existing academic and practitioner conversations point to managers’ demographics or ideology as the source of resistance to diversity initiatives. We propose that such resistance may originate from the managerial position itself. We argue that positions of structural power induce organizational identification, which motivates a view that one’s workplace is equitable. Seven archival studies of government employees (Studies 1a–1 g) and three surveys of working adults (Studies 2a, 2b, and 3) suggest those higher in structural power perceive less inequity in their workplace due to higher organizational identification, resulting in lower support for diversity initiatives. Asking managers to deliberate on inequities within their own organization, thus challenging their default positive view, helps managers overcome their identification barrier (Study 4).

We offer a more nuanced view by proposing that intrinsic motivation does not uniformly increase prosocial behavior toward all others. Specifically, we argue that employeeswith higher intrinsicmotivation aremore likely to value intrinsicmotivation and associate it with having higher morality (i.e., they moralize it). When employees moralize intrinsic motivation, they perceive others with higher intrinsic motivation as being more moral and thus engage in more prosocial behavior toward those others, and judge others who are less intrinsically motivated as less moral and thereby engage in less prosocial behaviors toward them. We provide empirical support for our theoretical model across a large-scale, team-level field study in a Latin American financial institution (n 5 784, k 5 185) and a set of three online studies, including a preregistered experiment (n5 245, 243, and 1,245), where we develop a measure of the moralization of intrinsic motivation and provide both causal and mediating evidence.

To meet this demand, organizations may span different categories. However, valuing spanners is challenging for audiences. We contend that spanners’ valuation depends on category nesting, as the congruence of informational cues varies between basic categories and subcategories. Furthermore, we expect that more expert audiences find spanners to be more congruent (and hence, more valuable) at a subordinate level than at a basic level of categorization. We test our hypotheses using a mixed-methods design in the context of venture capital investments. We analyze observational data on more than 29,000 venture capital deals and develop two experimental studies. Our findings support our hypotheses that subcategory spanning lowers valuation, and that this effect is attenuated as investors’ expertise increases. Our experimental studies further show that congruence is a causal mechanism explaining these effects.

Drawing from the innovation collaboration literature, and qualitative insights from interviews and contracts, we argue that collaboration risk impairs task performance of public–private versus private–private collaboration. We attribute this to two collaboration risk mechanisms: cooperation problems arising from misaligned social versus economic incentives, and coordination problems due to differences in organizational governance and processes. We test our hypotheses using the development history of 2,496 antimicrobial drugs from 1995–2019. After accounting for endogenous selection into collaboration, we find that public–private collaboration is less effective than private–private collaboration. However, this performance gap reduces for innovation tasks under high technological uncertainty (i.e., in the discovery stage and for developing new drug action mechanisms). To probe the distinctive cooperation and coordination mechanisms, we also examine innovation task efficiency. Findings reveal a wider gap in task effectiveness but not efficiency between public–private and private–private collaboration, suggesting more significant cooperation than coordination problems. Our theoretical and practical insights pertain to whether, when, and how public–private and private–private collaboration offer viable pathways for socially beneficial innovation tasks.

By analyzing longitudinal qualitative data fromone of the world's largest digital labor platforms, we found that the platform implemented three experimentation regimes-explicit, concealed, and unbounded-that reconfigured workers' autonomy in unexpected ways. We theorize the introduction of and successive changes in platform-based experimentation as constitutive of the ""experimental hand."" Our model of the experimental hand captures how successive changes in platform-based experimentation regimes reconfigure workers' degree of autonomy: workers first experienced increased autonomy, followed by diminished autonomy, and finally workers normalized their diminished autonomy as a ""business as usual"" aspect of work life on the platform.

This research examines a group of employees who have received relatively less attention in the employee awards literature: those who are nominated for but fail to receive an award. Integrating social comparison theory with the functional theory of counterfactual thinking, we argue that nonwinner nominees go through complex motivational states and affective experiences, which influence their collaboration responsiveness to colleagues. We conducted a field quasi-experiment using 160,830 collaboration records of 494 employees over eight months (Study 1) and a multisource study using survey data and 34,911 collaborative records of 598 employees over two months (Study 2). The results revealed that, compared to non-nominees, nonwinner nominees have lower collaboration responsiveness to winners following the award announcement, especially when they have a higher structural proximity to winners. However, in the long run, nonwinner nominees have higher collaboration responsiveness to others in general. Furthermore, being nominated for but failing to receive an award simultaneously induces nonwinner nominees to experience higher causal-inference counterfactual thinking and negative affect, which exert opposing impacts on nonwinner nominees’ collaboration responsiveness. This research advances the understanding of the impact, influencing mechanisms, boundary conditions, and temporal dynamics of employee awards on workplace collaboration.

Despite the universal necessity of wearing clothes and the fact that employees make decisions about this daily, organizational scholars have not yet addressed this question. We integrate sociometer and enclothed cognition theories to propose that aspects of clothing—their aesthetics, conformity, and uniqueness—hold symbolic meanings that have implications for employees’ state self-esteem and subsequent task and relational behaviors (i.e., goal progress, social avoidance). We first provide evidence for the nature of the symbolic meanings associated with these three dimensions of work clothing in a set of within-person experimental studies. The results of a 10-day field study of employees from four organizations generally supported our predictions, showing that daily clothing aesthetics and uniqueness had effects on state self-esteem and downstream behavioral consequences. The effects of daily clothing conformity emerged under the condition of greater interaction frequency with others in the workplace.

We argue that producers compete against prior and current competitors, and against their past selves. In the context of 153 artists active during a key period of the emergence of modern art (1905–1916), we utilize a convolutional neural network used in computer vision to extract feature vectors of artworks, and measure quantitative distance of these artists’ works from canonical reference points. We find that artists are rewarded for distinctiveness from prior and current competitors and their past selves (up to a point). However, artists’ autonomy to differentiate themselves depends on their position in the social structure, which we divide into supply-side artist-to-artist networks, and demand-side artist-to-gallerist networks. Artists with high or low supply-side status receive higher rewards for distinctiveness from current competitors than do artists with middle supply-side status. Artists with higher demand-side status receive higher rewards for distinctiveness from their own past, but lower rewards for distinctiveness from current competitors. These results show that peers strive to constrain each other to conform to positions of gravity within product space, and that market audiences deploy either higher or lower constraints on a producer’s identity depending on the reference point.

While the dominant explanations for this link involve physiology and cognitive resources, we offer a different perspective. We suggest that dreams, or psychological experiences during sleep, spill over to affect employee behavior. This spillover effect, we argue, results from the interplay between dreaming, meaning creation, and emotion. Taking a morning-of perspective, we theorize that recalling and ascribing meaning to dream experiences elicits awe—an epistemic emotion produced by appraisals of vastness and a need for cognitive accommodation. In turn, because awe reduces individuals’ focus on themselves and their concerns, we argue that experiencing awe upon awakening increases employee resilience, and ultimately goal progress, throughout the workday. However, because awe entails a felt need to expand one’s existing ways of knowing, employees may vary in their receptivity to awe. We therefore argue that the link between awe and resilience hinges on trait epistemic curiosity, or employees’ inherent desire to seek and acquire new knowledge. Across three studies—including a morning-of field study, a single-day morning–afternoon study, and a two-week experience sampling study—we find that ascribing positive meaning to dreams elicits awe, which in turn promotes resilience, and ultimately goal progress, throughout the workday.

We develop a contingency framework explaining how movements’ success depends on the internal fit between their private and public politics strategies with the tactics of mass and elite mobilization. We also highlight the importance of how these tactics fit with external conditions like the cognitive legitimacy of the industry and industry countermobilization. When movements rely on a private politics strategy to condemn an industry in the eyes of the public, social movement mass will be decisive. Alternatively, when movements use a public politics strategy to push for regulatory intervention, mobilization of elites is crucial. We develop our understanding of external contingency factors by exploring how cognitive legitimacy residuals from local ancestral populations affect both mass-driven private politics and elite-driven public politics, and how national-level industry countermobilization efforts affect elite-driven public politics strategies. We test these ideas in a historical study of the Scottish whisky distilling industry during the rise of temperance movements (1823–1921). We contribute to the social movements literature by showing how movements’ entry deterrence in contested industries depends on the internal fit between their strategies and mobilization tactics, as well as on their engagement with external contingencies.

Through this qualitative investigation, we develop a grounded model that illustrates the process of brokering identities, a form of identity work diversity trainers engage in that involves their deliberate efforts to call themselves and others in during diversity training.

Although these firms created “out of necessity” possess few resources besides their founder’s human capital, the role that this critical endowment plays in establishing a successful firm during a crisis is unclear, as existing knowledge offers diverging predictions about the value of general and specific human capital. We argue that this debate remains unresolved because we lack a holistic understanding of how each human capital type influences performance when founding conditions vary, and aim to reconcile the contrasting claims by considering how “hard” a crisis hits a given industry. Analyzing data collected from 500 founders who created firms in Greece during the Great Recession, combined with data from the Greek Statistical Office, we find that general human capital provides the greatest benefits, on average, during a crisis; yet specific human capital is more valuable in both the most favorable and the most unfavorable industry contexts. These results reveal how the value of human capital in entrepreneurship is contingent on founding conditions, and call into question existing notions of what it means to be resilient in a crisis. © 2024 Academy of Management.

However, evidence has hinted that morality may not always be a burden and instead could spark creativity. I develop a model that investigates how work moralization—or the degree to which individuals integrate moral considerations into their work tasks—influences employee creativity. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, I argue that work moralization can lead to prevention-focused cognitions (i.e., moral rumination), which impair and redirect the cognitive resources needed for creativity. However, I also posit that work moralization can lead to promotion-focused cognitions (i.e., cognitive flexibility), leading employees to adopt cognitive approaches that increase creativity. Moreover, integrating research on value congruence, I suggest that work moralizers are the least likely to ruminate—and the most likely to become cognitively flexible—when they perceive that their values are aligned with those of their organization, which ultimately fosters higher levels of creativity. I test my theoretical model with two field studies and a preregistered experiment. This research challenges the consensus that moral considerations generally have a negative impact on creativity, and contributes to research on organizational ethics and creativity.

Through an inductive process study, we examine the development of the market for genomic (DNA) data—an emergent digital market plagued by moral conflicts over privacy and ownership. Drawing on interview, archival, and observational data, we analyze how rules for exchanging genomic data emerged, and how entrepreneurial technology-development moves influenced those rules. Our findings reveal a four-step process, which we call the technological entrainment of moral issues, involving the progressive synchronization of framings, technical policies, technologies (software), exchange platforms, and market participant behaviors. This process baked particular moral stances on privacy and ownership into technological designs, which then dictated the rules market participants were required to follow to engage in exchange. We conclude that when markets are digital, technology processes central to exchange end up controlling many moral aspects of exchange. Our study contributes to theories of morally contentious markets and cultural or institutional entrepreneurship by illuminating how those theories can incorporate material (not only symbolic) aspects of technology processes and better explain the emerging moral order within the rapidly expanding realm of digital markets. © 2023 Academy of Management.

Based on an in-depth qualitative study of how apparel multinational corporations have addressed labor standards violations since the deadly 2013 Rana Plaza factory collapse, we show how CSR managers navigate the tension between the emerging responsible management logic and the highly institutionalized market logic, revealing how some go beyond accommodating responsible management within the market by prioritizing responsible management in market-protected spaces. We theorize the construction of market-protected spaces as a multilevel mechanism for institutionalizing an emerging logic in the context of a field dominated by the market logic via three forms of institutional work: restraining the jurisdiction of the market logic, infusing the responsible management logic with nonmarket elements, and maintaining market-protected spaces against resistance. A “market-protected space” is an institutionally bound space that suspends the dominance of the market logic on selected issues based on a binding institutional infrastructure that allows prioritizing responsible management—unlike voluntary CSR, which still prioritizes the market logic. The concept of a market-protected space maps a path for policy-makers, managers, and other actors interested in institutionalizing responsible management in the global economy.

To understand what motivates mentors to overcome this barrier and more fully engage with their mentees, we introduce a new construct, “learning direction,” which captures the beliefs people have about which individuals within a hierarchy—upward, lateral, or downward—are valuable sources of knowledge. Although most mentors believe knowledge resides higher up in hierarchies, the current research demonstrates mentors are more engaged and effective when they value insights from below. Our first three studies found that downward learning predicted mentor engagement (Study 1) because downward learning-directed mentors viewed mentoring as a worthwhile opportunity for their own learning (Studies 2A and 2B). A field study examined downstream consequences on mentees’ learning outcomes, finding that downward learning-directed mentors trained more hireable mentees (Study 3). A final experiment established causality while also demonstrating that learning direction is open to intervention: reflecting on a downward learning experience increased mentor engagement, which enhanced the mentorship experience for their mentees (Study 4).

Studies abound on how categories emerge and become established, or fall out of use. Yet, extant research has often examined the evolution of categories one at a time, leaving open the question of how related categories affect a focal category’s viability. In contrast, we consider both intra- and inter-category dynamics. Viewing categories as continuously shaped by actors’ efforts to position their products, we argue that these efforts alter the coherence that products exhibit not only within a category (a category’s heterogeneity), but also across related categories (a category’s distinctiveness). We theorize how the interaction between a category’s heterogeneity and distinctiveness shapes its subsequent viability. When a focal category’s distinctiveness is low, the heterogeneity–viability relationship takes an inverted U-shape. However, as distinctiveness grows, the relationship flattens and eventually flips to a U-shape. We explain this by considering the trade-off between the “classification” and “valuation” benefits that a category affords. We find support for our argument by tracking 170 categories over an 11-year period on Kickstarter, one of the largest crowdfunding platforms. By providing a nuanced understanding of category dynamics, we shed new light onto the fluctuating viability of categories. © 2024 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

Received wisdom is twofold: evaluators prefer White leaders because they possess prototypical leader traits; however, during periods of decline, evaluators prefer racial minority leaders because their stereotypical traits (e.g., warmth) position them to galvanize followers. We argue that whereas LCT is useful for explaining racial bias in nonsuccession contexts, it is insufficient for explaining racial bias during succession. During succession, evaluators focus on the predecessor as the comparison point when evaluating candidates. This causes stereotypes and prototypes to fade from evaluators’ minds, only to be replaced by a different racial bias—racial transference—which occurs when evaluators falsely assume that a leader candidate has the same personality traits as a racially similar predecessor, and thus will perform similarly. Consequently, evaluators select (reject) candidates who are racially similar to successful (unsuccessful) predecessors. We find support for these predictions in an archival study, a preregistered experiment, and three supplementary studies. Altogether, theory on racial transference establishes that racial bias during succession is driven by evaluators’ tendency to generalize between racially similar predecessors and candidates, even if such generalizations are inconsistent with prevailing stereotypes and prototypes. © 2024 Academy of Management.

Other leadership research has also assumed that leaders, especially founders, can transformtheir leadership influence into a legacy thatwill survive death and departure from the organization and continue to impact followers. However, to understand the historically embedded nature of leadership influence, it is critical to unpack how specific leaders can become group prototypes and influence followers after their departure. We address this opportunity by examining organizational ghosts-former organizational members who become the ideal prototype of an organization's values and identity. Drawing on qualitative data from an organizational merger, our analysis reveals that admired and adored leaders with broad exposure became embodied organizational prototypes. After organizational exit, they became organizational ghosts, institutionalized by associative learning, perpetuated practices, and physical memory work. When activated-either intentionally or organically-these ghosts had ""ghostly encounters"" (remembered and imagined) with remaining members that safeguarded the organization, comforted organizational members, and devalued alternative value systems.We introduce the concept of organizational ghosts, explain how leaders can become ghosts, and specify remembered and imagined encounters as mechanisms throughwhich former leaders can have enduring influence in organizations. © 2024 Academy of Management.

Extending this line of research, we examine how two structural factors—geographic and network proximity—affect men’s and women’s chances of forming high-status connections. Using data on the formation of collaboration ties with star scientists within the research and development laboratories of the 42 largest pharmaceutical companies between 1985 and 2010, we show that women who are geographically colocated with a “star” colleague are less likely to form a tie with that colleague compared to male peers who are similarly colocated, and that this difference persists irrespective of the star’s gender. Conversely, women benefit more than men do from network proximity, as indicated by the presence of common third-party ties, and this difference widens if the star colleague is also a woman. By illuminating how geographic and network proximity affect the chances of forming high-status connections differently for women than for men, our study goes beyond the notion that women have reduced access to workplace social capital and expands consideration to the structural factors that underpin—that is, amplify or reduce—that disadvantage. © 2023 Academy of Management.

Drawing from theories of executive human and social capital, we suggest that anticipation of internal disruption stemming fromhuman and social capital changes in a CEO succession may lead to external disruption for the focal firm. In our sample of S&P 500 firms between 2010 and 2018, we find that competitors are more likely to attack the focal firm when the successor's professional experience differs drastically from that of the predecessor and less likely to do so when the successor is an insider.We also find that competitors' attacks following a succession event can be minimized by limiting changes to only one form of capital (i.e., human or social). Moreover, retaining the predecessor as board chair after the succession could be an effective human capital preservation strategy for reducing competitors' attacks when the difference in professional experience between the predecessor and successor is high. However, retaining the predecessor as board chair may not have the same effect when it comes to social capital.

But do people build the network structure in which they perform best? We address this question by advancing a novel two-stage explanatory model that explicitly disentangles the network formation process from its performance effects. We hypothesize that “adaptors” (i.e., individuals inclined to focus on implementable solutions through commonly accepted and well-defined approaches) perform best when their network spans structural holes. Yet, these same individuals systematically forego opportunities to build relations across structural holes. By contrast, “innovators” (i.e., individuals inclined to focus on envisioning creative solutions that break away with established approaches) draw no or even negative performance returns from structural holes. Nevertheless, their inclination is to build ever-new bridging relations. We test and find support for this counterintuitive hypothesis through a randomized longitudinal field experiment enabling us to disentangle empirically both stages of our theorized process model. Our findings help illuminate why people may build networks that hurt their performance, shed a new light on the role of individual cognitive style in shaping network advantage, and bear concrete implications for organizations aiming to leverage networks to enhance employees’ performance. © 2023 Academy of Management.

In three studies, we examine how employees communicate with their partner about engaging in OCB and how this affects employees’ OCB, their work–family conflict, and their partner’s satisfaction. In Study 1, we use qualitative data to identify five ways employees communicate with their partner in order to engage in individual initiative OCB (e.g., staying late at work, volunteering for special assignments). In Study 2, using dual-concern theory, we hypothesize that self-concerned citizenship communication strategies will not only increase OCB, but also increase work–family conflict, and we predict that other-concerned communication strategies will reduce work–family conflict and increase partner satisfaction. Using survey data from employees and their partners, these hypotheses were partially supported. Finally, in Study 3, we use experimental vignette methodology to provide causal evidence that citizenship communication strategies influence partner satisfaction. Together, these studies increase our understanding of how employees communicate with their partner about OCB, indicate that there is no single communication strategy that has positive implications for both OCB and home life, and suggest that employees and their partners tend to think of OCB as involuntary for achieving family goals.

Although prior studies have investigated the roles of uncertainty and sunk costs as sources of inertia, an unacknowledged type of sunk cost associated with temporary suspensions of operations is related to the erosion of existing capabilities. Building on the resource-based view and real options theory, we argue that resource idling contributes to capability erosion and that the anticipated capability loss motivates firms to refrain from idling their resources under demand uncertainty in the first place. The negative effects of uncertainty on resource idling are likely to be particularly strong for firms with superior capabilities and for those having a greater reliance on human capital. Using data on oil drilling contractors in Texas, the empirical evidence lends support to our theoretical arguments. Our insights suggest that resource idling shapes the development path of capabilities and risks jeopardizing firms’ competitive advantages. The seemingly operational decision of temporarily idling resources can therefore be quite strategic for a firm, and “hysteresis,” or inertia in continuing operations, can preserve firms’ capabilities.

Integrating theorizing on cognitive resource allocation, we explain how and why the effect of individuals’ conflict experiences on their task performances hinges upon their self-regulation of attention processes guided by the structural elements of conflict experiences. In Study 1, using data extracted from continuous audio and video streams of paramedics participating in live-actor mass-casualty response exercises, we found that sending within-team conflict and receiving between-team conflict related positively with task performance, whereas receiving within-team conflict related negatively to task performance. In Study 2, we conducted a mixed-design scenario-based experiment to examine the underlying mechanisms that drive such effects. Our findings reveal that on-task attentional pull was an important mechanism for a positive sending within-team conflict–task engagement relationship, whereas off-task attentional demands were driving the negative receiving within-team conflict–task engagement relationship.

Yet, many professionals face audiences in their relational contexts—especially powerful clients—who can hold incongruent values and may threaten professionals’ jurisdictional control. How can experts enact their values without jeopardizing their jurisdictional control amid clients holding incongruent values? We examine career advisers in undergraduate business schools, whose occupational values often contrasted with values common among their student clients. Through an ethnography of one school’s career advisers, combined with interviews of such advisers throughout the United States, we find that advisers navigated interactions by discerning student values and accordingly modulating their value-enactment practices through masking, moderating, or magnifying their values. This allowed advisers to uphold their jurisdictional control when facing students exhibiting incongruent values, while enacting their values with students exhibiting unclear or congruent values. We contribute to the relational perspective on occupations and professions by positing how discernment and modulation help experts navigate relational tensions by recognizing and drawing on intraclientele heterogeneity, unpacking how professionals might not entirely resist or change amid incongruence but instead pursue a more mixed approach, and highlighting when and how experts mask or moderate rather than overtly enact their values.

Triggered by the error experience, these professionals engaged in a cognitive sensemaking process, aiming to determine the root causes of the error and evaluate their level of responsibility. In this process, clinicians considered aspects of themselves and their social environment (i.e., supervisors, organization, colleagues, and clients) as either sensemaking assets or liabilities. The self and others became sensemaking assets when helping to alleviate initial feelings of guilt, and sensemaking liabilities when aggravating them. Depending on the outcome of their sensemaking process, clinicians engaged in control-focused or escape-focused identity work.

We draw from two tenets of social information processing theory to propose that negative contact with beneficiaries has a dual effect on employees. Whereas negative contact may make employees perceive low social worth, it may simultaneously lead employees to believe they are engaging in self-sacrifice for a worthy cause—a relatively positive justification of such experiences. We investigated these ideas in three studies. In Study 1, a three-wave survey of registered nurses and their supervisors supported the hypothesized dual effect. Further consistent with our theorizing, the effect of perceived self-sacrifice on job satisfaction and performance was contingent on coworker emotional support: with higher support, perceived self-sacrifice exhibited a null relationship with satisfaction and a positive relationship with performance; with lower support, these effects were negative. In Study 2, we again studied nurses using an experimental vignette method, showing that negative contact exhibits a causal effect on employee perceptions, and that negative contact is more likely to lead to perceived self-sacrifice when the contact is attributed to the nature of the work versus one’s own performance. In Study 3, a two-wave survey of people from various occupations replicated the effects of negative contact on perceived social worth and perceived self-sacrifice.

First examining the role of managerial agency and collectivist shared values in the pay transparency–compression relationship in a simulation-based experiment, we test the overall model in a multisource field study using a sample of 111 medical device distribution firms. Our findings demonstrate that: (a) firm-level pay transparency is predictive of greater pay compression, (b) firm-level rates of i-deal grants are largely explained by this pay compression via its effects on employee i-deal requests, and (c) this sequential effect is amplified in firms with more collectivist shared values.

We argue that this predominantly positive view of recipient reactions to helpers is because the literature has not adequately distinguished the outcomes of reactive helping (i.e., assistance provided in response to a request) from those of anticipatory helping (i.e., assistance offered or provided in advance of being asked). We propose that anticipatory helping, especially from helpers with higher status than the recipient, is more self-threatening to recipients than is reactive helping; hence, recipients are less likely to accept this help and more likely to lower their evaluations of both the helper’s performance and their relationship with the helper. We find support for these hypotheses with four studies and one supplemental study that use experimental and field methodologies across a range of work contexts and social exchange relationships. Because our findings imply that both peer- and higher-status employees should withhold anticipatory help, which is impractical and potentially detrimental, we identify how these helpers can instead mitigate the negative effects of anticipatory helping by signaling a more balanced social exchange relationship with the recipient.

We complement extant work by studying factors beyond the investor-startup pair; namely, incidental contextual factors such as changes in the physical environment. Drawing on affect-asinformation theory, we conjecture that, in the face of intense uncertainty, sunnier days may affect investors' mood and result in a greater likelihood of investment. Archival and experimental analyses inform our predictions. The former utilizes proprietary data on 1,335 startups graduating from European accelerators. Every accelerator holds a ""Demo Day,"" where startups pitch to investors. We find that graduating on a sunnier day increases the likelihood of investment. This effect is stronger under intense uncertainty, where (a) startups are nascent, or (b) founders have limited human capital.

When a crisis strikes a firm, the continuation of those relationships can be jeopardized, as many indirectly affected firms will leave the relationship. This abandonment can be particularly harmful if the crisis-struck firm is dependent on the relationship for valuable resources. However, some firms choose to continue their relationship with the crisis-struck firm. We consider what makes those firms resist the temptation to respond rigidly and abandon the crisis-struck firm. We contend that firms that defy such indirect threats do so as a result of threat-defiant learning, which stems from confidence gained from their prior relational experiences. We test this concept in the context of venture capital firms’ (VCs) investments after venture crises in the form of venture involvement in a lawsuit. Studying 435 VCs’ decisions on whether to continue to invest in 105 ventures experiencing lawsuits, we find support for threat-defiant learning. This study contributes to the literature on crisis, threat rigidity, and entrepreneurship by showing how firms can resist threat rigidity in interfirm relationships, specifically how VCs learn from experience to defy threats posed by venture lawsuits and make post-lawsuit follow-on investments.

In addition, wespecify an antecedent condition that produces such daydreams (cognitively demanding work; Studies 1 & 2) as well as a boundary condition of the effects of daydreaming on creativity (professional identification; Study 2). Taken together, the studies reported here largely support our theoretical model. Cognitively demanding work reliably elicits both facets of daydreams. However, only problem-oriented daydreams relate to creativity directly; the relationship between bizarre daydreamsand creativity is entirely dependent on professional identification. In addition, we observe negative relationships between both facets of daydreams and performance more generally when employees lack professional identification (Study 2).

While there has been growing research on insider activists who import social movement resources, little is known about how internal activism might operate through a coordinated and collaborative approach with external social movement organizations, which we refer to as embedded activism. Likewise, collaborative activists encounter organizations with a wide range of prior reform experience, and the resulting “opportunity structure” for collaboration is not well understood. We investigate how a network of embedded activists can operate to advance reform efforts across diverse organizations. Our analysis combines surveys, interviews, and archival records from the Environmental Defense Fund’s Climate Corps program, which embeds graduate students in partner organizations to advance climate change reforms. Embedded activists accomplish this work by matching external resources with the organizational context in order to generate a fertile mixture of support and ambiguity and create new solutions. External resources are especially important for organizations that are at the extremes of prior issue development. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We develop and test a moderated-mediation model of expert decision-making linking expertise, identity threat, and overprecision to understand when and why experts offer overly precise judgments, and how they can cope with disconfirming feedback. We find support for this model in a series of lab experiments which show that (a) experts are more likely than novices to double down and produce overly precise predictions following disconfirming feedback, (b) this feedback-induced overprecision by experts is mediated by perceived level of expert identity threat, (c) the source of the feedback matters for identity threat and overprecision, and (d) self-affirmation attenuates identity threat and reduces overprecision. We supplement these experimental findings by investigating experts’ response to disconfirming feedback in two real-world settings: Major League Baseball umpiring and chief financial officer predictions of stock market returns. Our model and results show that feedback can harm expert decision-making by leading experts to be overly precise in their judgment, challenging existing notions on the ability of expert decision-makers, and providing insight into when and why experts should be relied upon in organizational decisions.

In this study, we contribute to the impression management literature by exploring how both positive and negative strategic noise may intercede in the process of reactive impression management. We argue that in reactive impression management, since firms already know the initial market reaction to a focal event, they can “strategically” release subsequent positive or negative strategic noise depending upon the direction and magnitude of the initial market reaction to the focal event. Using a sample of 7,575 mergers and acquisitions from 2001 to 2015 that represent our focal events, we find strong evidence to support our arguments.

We test our hypotheses in three studies: a field survey, a preregistered analysis of an archival dataset, and a preregistered experiment. This work provides evidence that the internal self-views long associated with those from lower social class backgrounds may not adequately describe the upwardly mobile. Contrary to having a persistent low sense of their abilities, we find that the upwardly mobile espouse high efficacy and do speak up but that managers appear less likely to provide them with equal opportunities for voice, instead seeking it from employees from more elite backgrounds.

In this paper, we consider compassion as an agentic action by which employees may replenish their own depleted resources and thereby recover. We draw on conservation of resources theory to examine the resource-generating power of two distinct expressions of compassion (self- and other-directed) on three dimensions of burnout (exhaustion, cynicism, inefficacy). Utilizing two complementary designs—a longitudinal field survey of 130 social service providers and an experiential sampling methodology with 100 business students across 10 days—we find a complex pattern of results indicating that both compassion expressions have the potential to generate salutogenic resources (self-control, belonging, self-esteem) that replenish different dimensions of burnout. Specifically, self-compassion remedies exhaustion and other-compassion remedies cynicism—directly or indirectly through resources—while the effects of self- and other-compassion on inefficacy vary. Our key takeaway is that compassion can indeed contribute to human sustainability in organizations, but only when the type of compassion provided generates resources that fit the idiosyncratic experience of burnout.

In doing so, we develop a model that illustrates how constructing a “moral dualism” is central to stigmatizing an organizational category. This involves concurrently establishing “stigmatizers” (ingroup) as morally superior and amplifying the deviancy of the fossil fuel industry (outgroup), both in relation to analogical contexts. Stigmatizers strategically employed two types of analogy: “deep” and “surface.” Deep analogies produce emotive power, facilitating the moralization of the ingroup through the transfer of affective meanings from a source context to a target domain. Surface analogies generate causal power to inform wider audiences of the target’s deviance through association with already-stigmatized organizational categories. Analogical power underpinning the morally dualistic nature of stigmatization can therefore empower fringe actors to stigmatize an incumbent as they appropriate meanings from analogical source domains.

Improved communication technology has facilitated the use of bridge supervision, so manager and boss can easily interact by audio or onscreen as a pair of people disconnected from surrounding colleagues—but at what cost to the manager, or to effective management? We argue that bridge supervision affects the way in which managers play their role, but not how well the role is played. We find clear support for the argument in a traditional corporate hierarchy. Managers operating under bridge supervision exclude the boss from their work discussions and are conservative in expressing emotion. Behavioral correlates notwithstanding, compensation and good ideas have their familiar association with network brokerage independent of bridge versus embedded supervision. In sum, bridge supervision affects manager style, but not performance.

This consensus is due in part to these employees' ability to work with traditional 20th-century technology. Such pairings balance the systematic nature of conscientious employees with the technology's need for user input and direction to perform tasks-resulting in a complementary match. However, the 21st century has seen the incorporation of intelligent machines (e.g., artificial intelligence, robots, and algorithms) into employees' jobs. Unlike traditional technology, these new machines are equipped with the capability to make decisions autonomously. Thus, their nature overlaps with the orderliness subdimension of conscientious employees-resulting in a non-complementary mismatch. This calls into question whether the consensus about conscientious employees' effectiveness with 20th-century technology applies to 21st-century jobs. Integrating complementarity and role theory, we refine this consensus. Across three studies using distinct samples (an experience sampling study, a field experiment, and an online experiment from working adults in Malaysia, Taiwan, and the United States), each focused on a different type of intelligent machine, we show not only that using intelligent machines has benefits and consequences, but, importantly, that conscientious (i.e., orderly) employees are less likely to benefit from working with them. © 2022 Academy of Management.

In college admissions and workplace hiring contexts, we find that decision-makers are more likely to favor disadvantaged applicants over applicants with objectively higher achievements when choosing between selection policies than choosing between individual applicants. We document this policy-people gap among admissions officers, working professionals, and lay people using both within-subject and between-subject designs and across a range of stimuli. We find that the gap is driven in part by shifting standards of fairness across the two types of decisions. When choosing between individuals, compared to choosing between policies, decision-makers are more likely to prioritize what is fair to individuals (a microjustice standard of fairness) over what is fair in the aggregate (a macrojustice standard of fairness). As a result, an intervention that has decision-makers prioritize the same standard of fairness across the decisions mitigates the policy-people gap. This research helps us understand why decision-makers' choices so frequently violate espoused organizational policies and suggests one way to increase the representation of disadvantaged groups in organizations. © 2022 Academy of Management.

But how do these distributed efforts-which often vary in strength-interact? To answer this question, we attend to the interaction between weak and strong governance reforms. Drawing on longstanding research on organizational values and the sociology of law, we theorize how the enactment of weak and broad sustainability legislation is likely to increase pressure on values-driven businesses to pursue both values authentication and material authentication by way of strong third-party certification. We test our conceptual model by examining the effects of the frequently criticized benefit corporation legislation passed in 36 U.S. jurisdictions on the related B Corporation certification. We find that new certifications and recertifications both increase in jurisdictions with such legislation and these effects are amplified or attenuated depending on corporate sustainability norms in the region. Taken together, our findings contribute to the intensifying societal conversation regarding the prospects for remaking capitalism, illustrating how even weak legislation can contribute to systems change not only by encouraging incremental sustainability reforms within a field but also by triggering an authentication imperative that mobilizes values-driven businesses to pursue rigorous certifications. © 2022 Academy of Management.

Using dual formation strategies from the onset fosters the development of stronger transactive memory systems, because close relationships facilitate smooth coordination among founders specializing in complementary tasks. Transactive memory systems thus mediate the relationship between formation strategies and early entrepreneurial success. Findings from two field observational studies and a field intervention study support our theory: teams formed based on a dual strategy raised greater seed funding on Kickstarter—a leading crowdfunding platform—(Study 1), were more successful in a prestigious entrepreneurial competition (Study 2), and gained more profits from selling their initial products (Study 3).

Building on social role theory, we develop a moderated-mediation model showing: (a) TMT psychological safety mediates the effect of TMT gender diversity on firm ambidextrous strategic orientation (ASO) (why), and (b) firm slack moderates this mediated effect (when). We tested our model in the context of Chinese high-tech small- and medium-sized enterprises. After confirming gender differences in social role-based proclivities at the TMT level, a multiwave survey study of 373 members from 120 TMTs showed that TMT gender diversity positively affects ASO via TMT psychological safety, and this mediated effect is stronger when firm slack is lower than higher. We further interviewed 23 top managers to supplement key quantitative results. Our study advances upper echelons researchon TMT gender diversity in two ways. First, it highlights the gender-specific interpersonal benefit of TMT gender diversity, which is markedly distinct from the cognitive-variety argument associated generically with TMT demographic diversity. Second, it considers both men and women in TMTs in a more balanced manner, thereby offering an alternative account to the female-focused theorization of the positive strategic implications of TMT gender diversity.  © 2021 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We explore how the sequence in which individuals expose ideas to their network contacts affects their innovation performance. We argue that, during idea elaboration, inside-out network sequencing—that is, mobilizing input and support from inner-circle ties before outer-circle ones—yields an innovation performance advantage over outside-in network sequencing and all-in-one mobilization of network contacts. Inside-out network sequencing generates valuable early feedback and support from inner-circle ties that actively engage with ill-defined, ill-structured, and uncertain ideas, and delays exposure to outer-circle ties until ideas can better withstand criticism from beyond the social circle where they emerged. We further contend that the benefits of inside-out network sequencing are amplified in environments that lack support for innovation. Using an analysis of survey data and archival innovation performance records for 301 research and development scientists and engineers in a large multinational firm, we find support for our predictions.

We develop a process model of professional stigmatization that identifies the dynamics that precipitate and then catalyze that trajectory and highlight the underpinning mechanisms.

We develop and test a model of how social identity processes, as outlined in selfcategorization theory, influence how perceiving that one is treated as an insider encourages behaviors reflecting social engagement with host country nationals, both within and outside of work. In a sample of 389 Syrian refugee employees in 88 supervisory units, perceived insider status was indirectly related to work initiative and community embeddedness through organizational identification. These indirect effects were moderated by diversity climate and perceived stigmatization of refugees in the broader society. Perceived insider status had its weakest effect on identification, and was not related indirectly to the outcomes when diversity climate was lower and perceived stigma was higher. We discuss the implications for theory development and practice concerning how social identity salience can inhibit personal affirmations at work from encouraging members of marginalized groups to demonstrate a deeper commitment to the organization and society. © 2022 Academy of Management.

I find that a shared sense of meaningfulness is composed of a shared feeling and a shared representation that are constructed sequentially. Leaders trigger and propel formation through a set of actions I refer to as ritual work that proliferates emotional energy across the population of members. Members subsequently share their feelings of emotional energy through talk and gesture to develop a shared feeling of meaningfulness. Leaders then articulate words and connect these words to shared feelings to produce a shared representation of meaningfulness. I integrate these findings into a three-step process model.

Taking a sociocultural perspective on social class, we argue that a key contributor to the class pay gap is that people from upper-class origins tend to work in occupations with greater autonomy, whereas their lower-class counterparts tend to work in occupations that are more prosocial. We further propose that autonomous occupations pay better than prosocial occupations. Across two distinct nationally representative samples in the United States, we find that people with upper-class (vs. lower-class) parents are more likely to work in autonomous occupations, but less likely to work in prosocial occupations, even when controlling for education, occupational prestige, and other potential confounds. This pattern of occupational sorting explains a substantial portion of the class pay gap.

Taking the perspective of the disconnected firms to whom the broker is tied, the “alters,” we argue that structurally induced “inequity” in opportunity, or the broker’s potential recombination of a larger share of alters’ knowledge than vice versa, exerts a destabilizing effect on brokerage persistence. Furthermore, geographic distance, via its role in the cognitive classification of rivals, enhances alters’ tolerance for inequity and contingently weakens the destabilizing effect of structural inequity in knowledge recombination opportunity that benefits the broker. Specifically, we postulate about the sociocognitive prismatic nature of geography in that geographic distance makes it less likely that alter firms see the broker as a rival and are hence less sensitive to inequity. We test our hypotheses with 260 broker and 517 alter firms in the global biopharmaceutical industry from 1985 to 2005, yielding 53,377 triad-year observations using a complementary log-log discrete time survival estimator. Our results support the hypotheses, highlighting the interplay between structural inequity and geographic distance in explaining brokerage decay.

Their practices have generated strong criticisms from a police force unsure how to engage them because they lack an empathic understanding of hunters' lived experience. Through a three-year phenomenological ethnography of a U.K. hunting team, we advance efforts across organization research to theorize the role of lived experience in social action. Specifically, we deploy the phenomenological concept “way-of-being” to explain hunters' use of extreme practices. Our interpretive account shows how the multiple ways-of-being that characterize the team's lifeworld suffuse their practices with a complex layered affectivity that is constitutive of the commitment necessary for their persistence. This offers a phenomenological alternative to social psychological models of motivations for vigilantism while also advancing emotions research in organizational institutionalism and practice theory. Practically, our study contributes to the policing challenge of mitigating hunting's harmful effects by facilitating more constructive mutual engagement. This offers a possible pathway for addressing the broader challenge posed by epistemically closed, social media-enabled communities that act out their concerns in ways that disregard our common humanity. © 2022 Academy of Management.

How might such individuals end up achieving emancipation from an infantilizing identity? To address this puzzle, we conducted a longitudinal study of a German sheltered workshop, an organization providing employment for disabled people. We observed that workers with disability initially maintained a regulating organizational identity based on paternalistic segregation. However, over time, they constructed their own self-determining identity and coproduced a change in the workshop's identity from “shelter” to “inclusion.” First, we show that in order to coconstruct their preferred self-concept, benevolently marginalized individuals need to gain the support of those in power, who change their role from a guardian to an ally. Second, while achieving liberation from overt marginalization is likely to involve confrontation with one's oppressors, we suggest that achieving emancipation from benevolent marginalization is a collaborative process of mutual consciousness raising and sensitization. Third, while changes of identity may occur after exposure to alternative discourses, often involving the contentious performances of external activists, we show how insider activists mobilize collective action for change within a protectionist organization. © 2022 Academy of Management.

Yet, we know little about whether and how strategic decision makers' emotions are regulated and how such regulation influences strategy making. Based on a longitudinal study of Nokia from 2007 to 2013, we develop a process model of socially distributed emotion regulation. This model shows how various organizational groups help regulate top managers' emotions. Top managers contain their initial emotional reactions to strategic options thanks to activities performed by groups with power over top managers. This enables top managers to form data-informed reappraisals of strategic options, contributing to gradual changes in their emotions. The reappraisal process is aided by diverse groups performing distinct roles. Top managers' revised emotions, in turn, enable them to form new, iterative data-informed reappraisals and ultimately enable radical strategic change. Our study contributes to research on emotions and strategy making by showing how socially distributed emotion regulation operates during strategy making and influences its outcomes. We contribute to the cognitive perspective on strategy by showing how cognition and emotion interact over time during strategy making. © 2022 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

However, as prior studies have examined different facets of attention, a theoretical tension has emerged as to whether attention to a broader or narrower set of strategic issues better facilitates firm performance. On the one hand, a narrower breadth of strategic attention limits the risk of managerial cognitive overload. On the other hand, a greater breadth of strategic attention helps managers avoid blind spots and identify more or better opportunities. We argue that this balance shifts based on the quantity and quality of opportunities available in the market and on firms’ recently demonstrated ability to execute against these opportunities effectively and efficiently. Using a novel text-analysis tool that we develop, validate, and make available, we find support for our arguments within a random sample of Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 companies. We find that broader strategic attention is associated with enhanced performance in weaker opportunity environments, with firms using their resources efficiently, or with firms’ failure to utilize their capabilities effectively. In supplementary analyses, we also provide new insights into the importance of following attention with subsequent organizational action.

We predicted that Black women's categorical nonprototypicality would reduce the believability of their discrimination claims, but that their nonprototypical attributes would lead to divergent treatment, depending on the type of discrimination alleged. Our predictions were supported across six experimental studies (Studies 1-4b). Specifically, Black women's gender and racial discrimination claims were believed less compared to those made by White women and Black men, respectively. Moreover, after they alleged discrimination, Black women received less financial remedy versus White women, but more financial remedy versus Black men. Mediation testing revealed that the mechanisms underlying the believability and treatment of Black women were their nonprototypical categorization and attributes. Using discrimination data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Studies 5a and 5b replicated the effects observed on believability and financial remedy. By focusing on nonprototypicality at both categorical and attribute levels, we thus help to disentangle when Black women's intersectional invisibility may result in either intersectional advantages or disadvantages. © 2022 Academy of Management.

Chronotype refers to the setting of a person's biological clock that gives rise to a distinctive pattern of sleep habits and preferred diurnal activity. We propose a synchrony effect and predict that people are creative when the external clock is aligned with their internal, biological clock. According to our model, positive mood and creative self-efficacy act as affective and cognitive mechanisms of this synchrony effect. We present three studies that test our theorizing: a quasi-experimental field study with 260 employees, a day-reconstruction study with 238 employees, and a one-day experience sampling study with 319 employees. Across the studies, we find that chronotype moderates the effect of time of day on creativity. Overall, late chronotypes were more creative in the late afternoon and early chronotypes tended to be more creative in the morning. The alignment between chronotype and time of day also gave rise to positive mood and creative self-efficacy; however, the studies provide only partial support for the hypothesis that positive mood acts as a mediating mechanism. We discuss the implications of these findings against the background of an embodied cognition perspective on creativity. © 2022 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

First, founders' diverse experiences should foster startup survival because the combination of various experience-based knowledge components drives the needed innovation. Second, founders' shared experience in an incumbent firm in the industry of the startup should positively relate to startup survival because of the transfer of shared knowledge and routines. This paper reconciles both streams of research by proposing that startups can combine both types of experience-based advantages when founding teams are composed of founders who individually possess a variety of firm experiences and other founders who jointly transition from the same industry incumbent. Using a sample of startups in technological manufacturing industries, I test the direct effect of the two types of experiences and their complementarity in decreasing the likelihood of startup failure. The results show that such complementarities exist so that startups are less likely to fail when their founding teams combine within-founder experience variety and across-team shared experience.

Models of identity construction have suggested that a past career decision-choosing one professional “road” while leaving behind a “road not taken”-should lose its salience over time. We challenged that consensus by introducing the construct of forgone identity dwelling-thinking about and reflecting on a professional path that could have been. Our field and experimental studies showed that employees did dwell on forgone professional identities, even when the decision events that resulted in them were years in the past. Drawing on cognitive-motivational-relational theory, we showed that forgone identity dwelling resulted in longing-a yearning for something missing. Such longing created a “double-edged sword” for the behavioral consequences of forgone identity dwelling. On the one hand, longing was associated with increased withdrawal behavior and decreased helping behavior because employees were distracted from the here and now. On the other hand, longing was associated with job crafting that in turn reduced those reactions-particularly for employees with an internal locus of control.

We found that, as marginal leaders, L&D executives lacked an established template for their leader identity and had to navigate conflicting prescriptions for their function. The conception of learning—a process that involved finding a place in relation to significant counterparts, taking a stance on learning, and building learning spaces—allowed them to craft identities that gave meaning and direction to their work, grounding their identity as leaders. Not all marginal leaders took the same trajectory toward firm ground for their identities. Some left the margins to lead, embracing either an instrumental or a humanistic view of their function. Others learned to lead from the margins, casting that duality as a paradox. Taking a systems psychodynamic approach to examine marginal leaders’ trajectories through a defining duality, this study reveals the interplay between existential and strategic layers of leader identity construction.

We qualitatively investigate the influence that the town of Arco, Italy, and its periodic event “RockMaster” exerted on the emergence of the global sport climbing industry. We advance the concept of “catalyzing places” that support industry emergence and growth through an ongoing, cyclical process of three forces: “centripetal” (i.e., attracting), “catalyzing” (i.e., reacting), and “centrifugal” (i.e., ejecting). The forces attract communities of practice to the place, expose them to intense, transformational experiences toward entrepreneurship, and induce them to establish their businesses elsewhere. By redeploying the resources and reputation acquired in the place, these scattered communities enact a collective phenomenon of user entrepreneurship and ultimately industry emergence. We claim that the ongoing activities of the place, and the periodic ones of the event, are mutually reinforcing.

This is a crucial issue, especially for peripheral actors lacking the resources, status, or power of more central ones. Our historical analysis focuses on the long-term struggle of the Cree First Nation in Canada and explains how they succeeded in increasing their dispositional legitimacy in and through the settlements. This required work in three interrelated processes: expansive argumentation, including problematizing of the state of affairs and creating discursive resonance with the prevailing discourses and values; building momentum by generating attention and exerting pressure in networks of actors; and seizing opportunities to negotiate with the other side.

We find that employees’ encounters with measurement practices both affirm and challenge perceptions of work as worthy by influencing whether employees can accomplish their work tasks, see the impact of their work, and have a credible and valued voice in their interpersonal interactions. Building on these findings, we develop a model that theorizes practical, existential, and relational pathways through which measurement encounters create ongoing expansions and contractions of work worthiness.

This research has shown that individuals often construct both positive and negative meanings, which can be challenging to manage because the meanings people construct require a certain coherence to provide a foundation for action. This challenge is intensifiedwhen dirty work is intractable- when it is difficult, if not impossible, for a person to avoid doing this work. Our study of meaning-making in the face of intractable dirty work examines ragpickers in Mumbai, India, who handle and dispose of garbage, and are further tainted by belonging to the lowest caste in Indian society, and living in slums. These ragpickers constructed both an overarching sense of helplessness rooted in the intractability of their situation, and a set of positive meanings-survival, destiny, and hope-rooted in specific facets of their lives and enacted through distinct temporal frames. By holding and combining these disparate meanings, they achieved ""functional ambivalence""-the simultaneous experience of opposing orientations toward their work and lives that facilitated both acceptance and a sense of agency, and enabled them to carry on in their lives. © 2022 Academy of Management.

As individuals usually possess different types of ties, selecting the optimal ties in each phase and changing ties as needed are central activities for creative success. We identify the types of ties (weak or strong) that are helpful in idea generation and idea elaboration and, given this understanding, whether individuals activate ties in each phase accordingly. In an experimental study of individuals conversing with their ties, we provide evidence of the causal effects of weak and strong ties on idea generation and idea elaboration. We also find that individuals do not always activate ties optimally and identify network size and risk as barriers. Our results in a series of studies reveal that individuals with large networks, despite providing more opportunity to activate both strong and weak ties, activate fewer weak ties and are less likely to switch ties across phases than individuals with smaller networks, particularly when creativity is perceived as a high-risk endeavor. Finally, we find that activating the wrong ties leads to either dropping creative ideas or pursuing uncreative ones. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

However, demographic attributes-such as race, gender, and functional background-may create asymmetric influence patterns between group members in diverse groups because these demographic characteristics are often associated with status differences. In the current research, we examine how to attenuate this disparity in member influence in diverse groups by focusing on the role of a leader's gazing behavior. Across two studies,we found that asymmetric influence patterns in which high-status members tend to wield greater influence in group decision-making processes were attenuated when a leader increased their visual attention toward low-statusmembers in the group. This reduced disparity in member influence which in turn improved group information elaboration and group performance in a collective decision-making task. Theoretical and practical implications for leaders' visual attention, diversity, group decision-making processes, and group performance are discussed. © 2022 Academy of Management.

Retained transgressors experience the tension of liminality: they maintain their affiliation to the organization, making them structural insiders, but they have committed a transgression, making them moral outsiders. How might transgressors attempt to reintegrate and feel like full organizational insiders once again? And what makes transgressors feel more, or less, reintegrated? Previous work has studied reintegration from victims' or third-parties' perspectives, but little is known about transgressor reintegration. To build theory on transgressor reintegration, I studied transgressors at a military service academy. Through waves of qualitative data collection and inductive analyses, I find that transgressions threaten transgressors' integration, leading transgressors to feel precarious in their perceptions of membership and their feelings of belonging. Transgressors attempt to restore both elements, but use distinct approaches for each. Because belonging restoration requires positive interactions with many organizational actors, transgressors can-and, in my data, frequently do-experience restoration of membership but not belonging. Therefore, it may be relatively rare for transgressors to feel highly reintegrated following transgressions, even in organizations that devote considerable resources to reintegration. © 2022 Academy of Management.

We build on the dynamic strategic renewal literature, combine it with upper echelons theory insights, and integrate knowledge about female executives' career strategies to theorize how and when female appointments into top management teams (TMTs) cause firms to change their approach to knowledge-related strategic renewal. In doing so, we reconcile the tension among extant mediating processes invoked to explain how female TMT representation might affect strategic decisions: change orientation and risk-taking propensity. Estimating a dynamic ordinary least squares model on panel data from 163 multinationals, we find that following female (but not male) TMT appointments, TMT cognitions shift, becoming more change oriented and less risk seeking. Subsequently, these TMT cognitive shifts cause a decrease in mergers and acquisitions and an increase in research and development. Our model of female TMT appointments as catalysts that cause shifts in TMT cognitions, which, in turn, redirect knowledge-related strategic renewal from a buying to a building approach, is a novel effort at advancing research on women at upper echelons to examine time-dependent, within-firm mechanisms linking women in upper echelons and firm outcomes. © 2022 Academy of Management.

I seek to rebalance the existing conversation around this phenomenon by highlighting that it may also have interpersonal benefits. To identify these benefits, I revisit seminal theorizing to advance the construct of workplace impostor thoughts which I define as the belief that others overestimate one's competence at work. Incorporating theory on contingencies of self-worth, I present an integrative model that outlines why such thoughts may be positively associated with other-perceived interpersonal effectiveness and why they may not be. I test my theory across four studies (n 5 3,603) that feature survey, video, and preregistered experimental data. I find that employees who more frequently have such thoughts are evaluated as more interpersonally effective because they adopt a more other-focused orientation. I do not find that this interpersonal benefit comes at the expense of competence-related outcomes (i.e., performance, selection)-a point I revisit in my future directions. When examining my theorized competing pathway, I find that, whereas workplace impostor thoughts do encourage those who have them to self-handicap-consistent with prevailing wisdom-such thoughts do not operate through self-handicapping to harm other-perceived interpersonal effectiveness. I conclude by situating my findings alongside prior work. © 2022 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

We argue that women and men have different dominant narratives about the reasons why people discriminate against people of their respective genders. While women attribute the majority of their perceptions of gender discrimination in the workplace to patriarchal norms and practices, the majority of men’s perceptions of gender discrimination emerge from a belief that organizations are likely to discriminate against them in order to reduce discrimination against women. These differences in understandings about the root causes of gender discrimination also produce divergent psychological consequences. We argue that perceived workplace gender discrimination (a) reduces self-efficacy among women but not among men and (b) reduces both men’s and women’s sense of belonging in the workplace. We further argue that these effects contribute to a reduction of well-being among members of both genders, with the negative effect on well-being being more pronounced among women than among men. We examine these predictions in five studies of working adults.

We suggest that the impasse is partially due to prior research’s exclusive focus on how work orientation affects one’s effort and subsequent job performance. Drawing on theories of signaling, cognitive biases, and reciprocity, we propose that calling-oriented employees enjoy better objective career outcomes than job-oriented employees via an external pathway: managers misperceive employees’ calling orientation as evidence of better performance and stronger organizational commitment. In Study 1—analyses of the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study—we find support for the main effect, and in Study 2—an online experiment—we constructively replicate this effect and find evidence for our predicted explanatory mechanisms. Furthermore, observing a calling-oriented employee prompts managers to perceive them more favorably in other domains, creating a halo effect. Our research sheds light on how individuals’ subjective view of the meaning of work influences their objective career success, highlighting workplace signals and managerial perceptions as important mechanisms.

In addition, we explain how variety in executives’ gender, age, and tenure and an innovative climate weaken the negative effects of job demands on both overall innovation and the share of exploratory innovations. Our theory suggests that a controlling climate and employees’ education weaken the negative effect of job demands on overall innovation but exacerbate the negative effect of job demands on the share of exploratory innovations. Using surveys collected on-site from 243 Chinese firms, we find support for five of our 10 hypotheses and marginal support for three additional hypotheses but no support for the two moderating effects of innovative climate.

We identify two novel temporal work design characteristics that can speed up employees’ experienced passage of time: temporal predictability and task segmentation. Jobs with high temporal predictability do not make employees go through uncertain wait times before embarking on their next task. High task segmentation occurs when a large chunk of work time is segmented by categorically different temporal markers. We tested a model in which temporal predictability and task segmentation affect experienced passage of time, which in turn influences job performance, with five studies: two experiments that established the internal validity of temporal predictability and task segmentation (Studies 1a and 1b), a naturalistic field study in a factory that investigated the natural consequences of distinct temporal work design (Study 2), an organizational field study that constructively replicated the model using a sample of knowledge workers and their supervisors (Study 3), and an online survey in which we connected our model with the broader work design literature (Study 4).

We depart from the existing approach, which considers the effect of gender and other factors in isolation, and propose that endorsement depends on who suggests which ideas and in what ways. Drawing upon expectancy violations theory, we argue that ""positive counter-stereotypical voice""-conceptualized as an idea that signals desirable traits stereotypically associated with the opposite gender-is more likely to be endorsed compared to ""positive yet stereotypical voice"" (i.e., that signals desirable traits consistent with stereotypical expectations of the speaker's gender). We argue that communal voice for men and agentic voice for women constitute positive counter-stereotypical voice, whereas agentic voice for men and communal voice for women constitute positive stereotypical voice. Then, we examine why positive counter-stereotypical voice results in positive evaluations-endorsement- by arguing that it affects attributions of competence and benevolence, albeit differently for men and for women. We test our hypotheses across three studies-one field and two experimental.

Despite the benefits of informal mechanisms of coordination for knowledge-based work, there is considerable ambiguity regarding their effects in MTSs. To resolve this ambiguity, we build and test theory about how interpersonal interactions among MTS members serve as an informal coordination mechanism that facilitates team and system functioning. Integrating MTS research with insights from the team boundary spanning literature, we argue that the degree to which MTS members balance their interactions with members of their own component team (i.e., intrateam interactions) and with the members of other teams in the system (i.e., interteam interactions) shapes team- and system-level performance. The findings of a multimethod study of 44 MTSs composed of 295 teams and 930 members show that as interteam interactions exceed intrateam interactions, team conflict arises and detracts from component team performance. At the system level, a balance between intrateam and interteam interactions enhances system success.

It remains unclear how a difference between the national political climate and the CEO’s own political ideology might affect strategic decision-making. Applying upper echelons and threat response perspectives, we propose that divergence between the national political climate and the CEO’s own ideology provokes a threat response, leading CEOs to cut research and development spending and increase retained earnings. We then examine two boundary conditions for this relationship. First, we propose that CEO wealth tied to the firm in the form of vested stock options will increase the perceived threat of ideology divergence, strengthening the threat response. Second, we propose that industry regulation will dampen the threat perceived from divergence, as well as hindering the CEO’s ability to respond to the threat at all, because of greater stability and lower discretion, respectively.

We, therefore, adopt a paradox lens to explain the dynamics through which different actors within these systems navigate the contradictions that are generated. Drawing on a global qualitative study of multi-country risk pools that provide rapid capital in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, we advance paradox theory by showing how organizational actors' interactions (a) maintain equilibriumby generatingmutually reinforcing balance among paradoxes, while (b) the clustering of poles from different paradoxes generates disequilibrium, and (c) the reknotting of poles from different paradoxes restores equilibrium. As our process framework shows, these dynamics form an iterative cycle between equilibrium and disequilibrium that is essential in enhancing the promise of market-based solutions to address development issues, which in our study refers to increasing the rapid availability of capital to respond to disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and droughts. © 2022 Academy of Management.

These leaders were charged with advancing organizational goals in foreign markets. We find that some leaders enacted downward deference when they recognized that they had less expertise, networks, and influence relative to their local subordinates. This manifested in two ways: (a) attempts to reduce social distance, which involved seeking connection, earning trust, and participating in adjacent collaboration with local subordinates, and (b) yielding to subordinates’ expertise by privileging their judgment, transferring influence to them, and conforming to their local hierarchical expectations. Our supplementary quantitative analyses showed that previous experiences in foreign cultures, both in terms of total time spent abroad and exposure to cultures that were distant from their own, correlated with adopting downward deference. Those leaders also had higher job performance ratings, and were promoted to higher executive levels over time, compared to their counterparts who did not practice downward deference.

In a sample of employed adults, we used an experience sampling method to capture within-individual variation in small talk over a three-week period. Given that we are the first to examine small talk as an episodic phenomen on, we also conducted a validation of our daily small talk measure with master's students and two samples of employed adults. Using multilevel pathanalysis, results show that small talk enhanced employees' daily positive social emotions at work, which heightened organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) and enhanced well-being at the end of the workday; furthermore, small talk disrupted employees' ability to cognitively engage in their work, which compromised their OCB. Additionally, higher levels of trait-level self-monitoring mitigated negative effects of small talk on work engagement.

Our field research in two entrepreneurship-nurturing organizations in Detroit reveals important heterogeneity in resourcing modes and venture growth in time and space. Specifically, we find that ventures developed through differentmodes of resourcing (financing vs. local bricolage) grow at different spatiotemporal scales (scaling up toward fast geographical expansion vs. scaling deep toward locally anchored endurance), and consequently generate distinctive yet complementary contributions to their depleted place of origin. Unlike scaling-up ventures whose local impact was explosive yet short-lived, scaling-deep ventures created jobs, products or services, and spillover effects that stayed local and addressed specific local problems. Building on these findings, we challenge the exclusive pursuit of high-growth entrepreneurship for poverty alleviation and suggest that entrepreneurship-driven local development requires cohabitation of ventures growing at varying scales. © 2022 Academy of Management.

Accordingly, we hypothesize that the newness, simplicity, and unscriptedness of executive verbal communication are all positively associated with investor opinion convergence. We also argue that the effect of executive communication on investor opinion convergence will be amplified when investors have a greater demand for information as would be the case for those firms with higher earnings uncertainty.

Thus, we contend that in order to better understand people's competitive experiences, we must take a more holistic view, where their experiences and behaviors in the present are a function of their past and expected future outcomes. This research expands the temporal lens of competition by examining how past outcomes (i.e., winning vs. losing streak) and future expectations (i.e., underdog vs. favorite standing) collectively influence an actor's cognitive and affective reactions to a competition, with implications for their willingness to transgress. Studies 1 (fantasy football managers) and 2 (the English Premiere League teams) show that streaks and underdog vs. favorite standing interact to predict competitive transgressions: winning streaks increase transgressions for underdogs, and losing streaks increase transgressions for favorites. Studies 3 (public defenders) and 4 (Democrats and Republicans) experimentally manipulate streaks and standing and unpack the cognitive (i.e., outcome uncertainty) and affective (i.e., excitement for underdogs, and anxiety for favorites)mechanisms that precipitate these transgressions. Theoretical implications for the competition literature, as well asmanagerial insights, are discussed. © 2022 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

Prior research has reported that outside CEOs tend to underperform compared to inside CEOs, with high performance variance. Extending CEO-centric perspectives, we predict that experiential learning enhances post-succession performance, while negative transfer learning undermines it. We then offer a novel, stakeholder-centric theoretical perspective, conjecturing that stakeholders' negative sentiment toward the CEO appointment undermines post-succession performance. We further conjecture that outside CEOs are less effective in leveraging their executive experience and suffer more from negative transfer and negative sentiment when compared to inside CEOs, who can leverage their familiarity and social embeddedness in the firm, which explains why outside CEOs may underperform. Analyzing the appointments of CEOs in U.S. public firms, we find that counter to expectations, the length and breadth of their executive experience do not explain either post-succession performance or the performance differences between outside CEOs and inside CEOs. Rather, the misfit between CEOs' corporate backgrounds and their firms' characteristics and the negative sentiment surrounding their appointments explain performance differences and the underperformance of outside CEOs. Accordingly, our study directs attention to the important yet previously understudied reactions of stakeholders to CEOappointments. © 2022 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

In most cases, entrepreneurs face a trade-off: they can be a big fish in a small pond, getting more attention and development help from a smaller firm with less market access, or a small fish in a big pond, getting less attention and help from a larger firm with more market access. Our study investigateswhat goes into choosing between these options. Drawing fromresource dependence theory and an empirical study of tie formation between developers and publishers of PlayStation 2 video games, we develop and test a framework that identifies the key decision variables and focuses on two moderators-resource need evolution and resource uncertainty related to competition-that explain whether a big fish (more development help) or a big pond (more market access) drives tie formation.

We find that incumbents that have internal inventor network configurations in which inventors are heavily clustered into cohesive subgroups of interconnected inventors are more likely to build on new venture technologies. We suggest that such networks engender specific social capital in terms of information conduits, trust, and common vernaculars that is ideal for inventors to translate and share with their cluster members the technological insights that they have derived from outside sources. Moreover, any insularity that may result from having cohesive clusters is mitigated by internal competition between clusters. In contrast, having a highly connected inventor network engenders social capital that impedes incumbents' absorption of new venture technologies. Broadly distributed access to internal technology, combined with a strong social identity that results from high levels of connectedness, can lead to insularity and a ""not invented here""syndrome.

By departing from the widely held—though often implicit—assumption that culture defines the parameters of identity formation, this paper investigates how the alignment, or misalignment, between a founder’s identity and their perceived sociocultural context influences new firm creation. We engage in an in-depth qualitative study of 49 founders in Taiwan that reveals how founders’ identity structures can be (mis)aligned with their perceived social structures, and how the reinforcement or tensions generated by (mis)alignment can fuel the creation of fundamentally different types of ventures—including those that challenge the perceived sociocultural status quo with a social mission intended to push society toward a new equilibrium. Our theory of founder identity–society (mis)alignment is therefore able to specify a key mechanism linking the founder’s identity with perceived sociocultural context. Furthermore, we advance the influential Schumpeterian theory of creative destruction beyond the purely economic context to address the broader sociocultural environment and to incorporate the concept of creative reconstruction, in which entrepreneurs seek to restore elements of society past.

Through a qualitative, inductive study of a consulting firm, we delimit three auxiliary routines-absorption, dissemination, and differentiation-through which people navigate between the destructiveness of organizational toxicity and the need to perform given roles and tasks.

Moreover, given women's inroads into some traditionally maledominated occupations but not others, these workplaces are increasingly horizontally gender segregated. In this paper, we study how members of these symmetric and segregated occupations manage conflict in U.S. advertising agencies through the case of relationships between ""creatives"" (copywriters, designers, and creative directors) and ""suits"" or account practitioners (account executives, strategists, and managers). Creatives and suits are at the same organizational level in their agencies. While creatives are primarily men, suits, traditionally alsomen, are now primarily women. Drawing on participant observation in five different U.S. advertising agencies and over 100 interviews, we show howcreatives and account practitioners use gender ordering to overcome jurisdictional conflict. These practices are grounded in enacting essentialist gender differences that transform symmetric occupational relationships into hierarchical ones by embedding the gender hierarchy.We find that, while gender ordering helps women and men in cross-occupational pairs get work done, it also reinforces women's disadvantage, because, for women, it involves low-status and emotionally taxing scut work that it does not involve formen. © 2022 Academy of Management.

We draw on the theory of racialized organizations to explain the process whereby exposure to mega-threats leads to heightened avoidant work behaviors for racial minority employees. We theorize and find-across two studies centered upon various mega-threats, including a mass shooting targeting Asian Americans and police killings of Black civilians-that event observers who share identities with mega-threat victims become vicarious victims, which triggers an experience of “embodied threat,” an appraisal of the increased likelihood of personally encountering identity-based harm. The experience of embodied threat coupled with the racialized nature of organizational structures, which limits the agency of racial minorities, then compels employees to engage in threat suppression. Furthermore, we find that threat suppression consumes psychological resources, leading to heightened avoidant work behaviors, or higher work withdrawal and lower social engagement, but, when the psychological safety of identity-based discussions is high, it attenuates this effect. Altogether, our paper advances research on mega-threats and race in organizations, and yields practical insights that can assist managers in reducing the detrimental effects of mega-threats on employees. © 2022 Academy of Management.

Our primary setting for investigating this proposition is the privatization of Chinese firms. We argue that massive layoffs resulting from privatization triggered guilt among firm leaders to drive corporate philanthropy. The analysis of a national survey of Chinese private firms shows that on average privatized firms made approximately 26% more charitable contributions than firms founded as private. This was particularly the case when (a) privatization resulted in layoffs (vs. no layoffs), (b) the firms’ provinces experienced greater unemployment at the time of privatization, (c) the firms’ leaders were directly involved in privatization, (d) the influence of Confucianism was stronger in their provinces, and (e) firm leaders had stronger ties with laid-off workers. An interview-based field study of 25 firm leaders involved in privatization provides qualitative evidence of the influence of guilt on privatized firms’ philanthropy. Finally, a vignette experiment conducted on EMBA students shows the mediation of guilt between privatization and firms’ philanthropic intention. These findings establish guilt as a potent emotional driver of corporate philanthropy, helping redirect the attention of corporate philanthropy research toward nonfinancial drivers.

Yet, the literature on bias suppression (a facet of procedural justice) has indicated that the effects of debiasing initiatives are transient. We aim to explain why sustained bias suppression is intrinsically challenging under the condition of intermittent accountability. We theorize that bias suppression with high accountability induces counterfactual thinking and regret and, ultimately, with subsequent low accountability, decision reversal. However, this process does not occur when accountability is initially low and subsequently high. Thus, intermittent accountability has an asymmetric effect on bias suppression over time-bias suppression is reversed (and biased decisions sustained). We initially provide proof of concept using Standard & Poor's 500 Firms' CEOs. We then conduct a field study of prominent decision-makers: U.S. Supreme Court judges (Study 1). We find that bias suppression is negatively associated with consistency when accountability is initially high but later reduced, as seemingly mediated through counterfactual thinking.

Study 1, a large archival study using a nationally representative sample, finds that connecting as friends with colleagues online is prevalent. Study 2, examining employees across several industries, shows that people experience connecting as friends with colleagues online as boundary blurring. Two experimental studies (Studies 3 and 4) ascertain that employees are more likely to connect as friends online with colleagues who engage in more (vs. less) self-disclosure and are less likely to connect with bosses (vs. peers). Further, self-disclosure, gender, and rank interact, such that employees are more likely to connect with female bosses who disclose more, compared to those who disclose less, and compared to male bosses, regardless of self-disclosure. Our work contributes to boundary management research by demonstrating that employees' decisions to blur the personal/professional boundary online crucially depends on whom they are blurring the boundary with. © 2022 Academy of Management.

Building on our prior work on the chemical bisphenol A (BPA), this study examines how organizations deal with novel risks. It finds that organizations engage in ""risk translation""by translating equivocality associated with the novel risk into more familiar risks, providing them with a clearer basis and guide for action. As multiple organizations take actions to manage these translated risks, the interactive effects result in an ""ecology of risks""that evolves over time, allowing for the construction of a novel risk. The study contributes to research on organizing and risk by theorizing how organizations respond to novel risks, as well as by highlighting the role of translated organizational risks in constructing novel risks and shaping societal responses to grand challenges. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We argue that pluralistic value systems create multiple status conferral mechanisms, and that hierarchies' prestige varies as a function of the values they represent. While status inconsistency, in general, increases the likelihood that actors will pursue opportunities that can boost their lagging status, their status hierarchies' unequal prestige influences the magnitude and direction of actors' responses to their status inconsistency. Further, their ability to respond is constrained by their relative standing in their primary status hierarchy and the extent to which they are embedded in particular professional networks. Using the artistic and commercial status of Hollywood performers, we found that status-inconsistent performers were more likely to appear in films that could boost their lagging status in the commercial hierarchy when they possessed relatively higher artistic than commercial status. Moreover, being high-status decreased the likelihood a performer would pursue opportunities that could improve their lagging status only when they were high status in the artistic status hierarchy, while embeddedness only decreased the likelihood when their primary status hierarchy was commercial. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

We shift attention to an indirect process we call “portfolio spillover”-the extent to which activist behavior targeted toward a firm in an investor's portfolio of holdings influences actions by other firms that are not presently targeted for activism. We examine portfolio spillover by extending the awareness-motivation-capability framework from its traditional domain of competitive dynamics to the governance arena. We theorize that firms will be more likely to respond to investors targeting other portfolio members to the extent that those firms become aware of the implicit threat of activism. We also develop and test theory about how the capability of activists to launch a successful campaign and the motivation of firms to react can moderate this relationship. Using data from a sample of S&P 1500 companies from 2000-2013, we find that firms restructure and reduce growth in response to portfolio spillover. These relationships are stronger when activist investors have capability to attack and firms have motivation to respond. © 2020 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

We argue that institutions and social capital are not simply predictors of ownership structure but can also be historically persistent mechanisms through which past traumatic shocks to society shape modern businesses. Using data from over 30,000 firms across 41 sub-Saharan countries, we show that firms in areas that suffered high historical slave extraction are today more likely to have concentrated ownership. High slave export countries have more sole proprietorships and majority ownership, with our model implying a difference of 43 percentage points between the lowest and highest export countries. This difference is particularly pronounced in the manufacturing sector, where high capital needs can necessitate diffuse ownership when credit markets are weak. Finally, we present modest evidence that weakened institutions and social capital are among the mechanisms through which the historical slave trade increases modern ownership concentration. Our paper answers recent calls to bring both Africa and history back into management research through our theoretical extension into distinct and quantifiable historical origins of firm structure. © 2020 Academy of Management.

Prevailing theory suggests that it is primarily a benevolent force in business, and differences across world religions preclude examining effects that thread across religions. We develop a theoretical account that fundamentally challenges these assumptions by explaining how and why religiosity-regardless of which religion is prominent-differentiates based on gender, widening the gender wage gap. Guided by an integrated review of the religion literature, we specify three dimensions of gender differentiation-social domains, sexuality, and agency-that explain why religiosity widens the gender wage gap. A series of studies tested our theoretical model. Two studies showcased the predictive power of religiosity on the gender wage gap across 140 countries worldwide and the 50 United States via gender-differentiated social domains, sexuality, and agency, explaining 37% of the variance in the wage gap. U.S. longitudinal data indicated that the gender wage gap is narrowing significantly faster in secular states. Moreover, experiments allowed for causal inference, revealing that gender-egalitarian interventions blocked the effect of religiosity on the gender wage gap. Finally, theoretical and empirical accounts converge to suggest that religiosity's effect on the gender wage gap applies across the major world religions. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

Yet, our understanding of vicarious learning among individuals in teams is still quite limited, as this learning is often oversimplified (as one-way knowledge-sharing) or aggregated (as a collective, team-level property), resulting in incomplete and inconsistent findings. In this paper, I extend these views by exploring the underlying distribution of dyadic vicarious learning relationships in teams, specifically using a network approach to examine the consequences of reciprocity in team members' vicarious learning with one another (i.e., where both individuals in a given dyad learn vicariously from each other's knowledge and experience). Using a novel method for calculating weighted reciprocity in networks in a study of MBA consulting project teams, I demonstrate that greater team vicarious learning reciprocity is associated with greater team performance, and also moderates the performance consequences of teams' external learning efforts, offering a potential reconciliation of conflicting results in prior research. In doing so, this paper advances research on vicarious learning in teams, while also providing conceptual and empirical tools for studying learning and other interpersonal workplace interactions from a network perspective. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Using a strategy-based resource management framework, I also argue that there are synergies between leading by example and the manifestation of organizational core values. My theory is grounded in the strategy-based notion that combining organizational resources-leading by example (practical element) and organizational core values (conceptual element)-optimizes employee engagement, which in turn enhances productivity and service quality. I examine my model empirically using two-time-point panel data derived from three different sources (employees, financial data, and secret shoppers) in a sample of 233 retail stores. The findings provide evidence that leading by example improves productivity and service quality (after taking into account the potential influence of charismatic leadership). The indirect effect of leading by example on productivity and service quality (through engagement) is even stronger when manifestation of organizational core values is high.

We also find that these traits alter the relationship between stock risk and returns. Whereas financial economic theory generally posits a positive relationship between risk and returns, on average, we find that this relationship may be either positive or negative for a specific firm depending upon the observed personality of its CEO.

This effect is more pronounced for team members in a lower pay grade because they are more sensitive to social influence owing to their lower status in the team. We test these arguments through a three-part survey of 203 employees from 33 work teams of a telecommunication company in China. Our data show that pay grade dissimilarity is associated with lower relational uncertainty, more for individuals with a lower pay grade, and that lower relational uncertainty, in turn, is associated with higher task performance, higher identification with the team, and lower intent to leave the team.

This ambiguity has prevented meaningful theoretical advancements about employees' voice and silence at work. We draw on the behavioral activation and behavioral inhibition systems perspective to provide a conceptual framework for the independence of voice and silence and explicate how two key antecedents-perceived impact and psychological safety-more strongly relate to voice and silence, respectively. We further differentiate voice and silence by identifying their distinct effects on employee burnout. In Study 1, a meta-analysis, we demonstrate that voice and silence are independent (Mr 5 2.15) and that perceived impact (psychological safety) relates more strongly to voice (silence) than to silence (voice). We also find that silence has a significantly stronger association with burnout compared to voice. In Study 2, we constructively replicate these findings in an interval-contingent panel study across six months.

But what happens when individuals need or desire to disentangle their identities from institutions after identification has taken place? In this paper, I examine previously incarcerated men's efforts to de-identify with the institutional logics associated with prison as they transition back into society. While past work has tended to characterize de-identification efforts as ultimately successful, I reveal how individuals can remain stuck in their identifications and experience identity paralysis. In doing so I add nuance to our understanding of de-identification by revealing the factors that can contribute to its breakdown and failure. I highlight specifically the importance of identity material and the content of institutional logics in influencing de-identification processes, and thus extend the existing focus on the cognitive accessibility of logics. Importantly, I reveal that challenges to de-identification result not merely from the individuals “holding on” to old targets but rather from their becoming stuck and resigning themselves to existing targets when they simultaneously feel they lack identity material to realize new identities and face negative social evaluations. Indeed my findings point to the powerful and durable ways in which institutions shape our identities even when we desire to change them. © 2020 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

Study 1 uses a quasi-experiment to show that U.S. firms, but not non-U.S. firms, spend more on advertising in U.S. presidential election years versus nonelection years. In a controlled business simulation, Study 2 shows that participants spend more on advertising and training in presidential election years versus nonelection years. Two experiments involving practicing managers follow. Study 3 exposes managers to comparative political information featuring a U.S. Senate election; we observe an increase in spending on training and development programs. Study 4 exposes managers to comparative political information for state-level political races, finding that doing so reduces the importance of negative information in the subsequent managerial decision process and leads to increased marketing spending. Moreover, shifting the decision frame from selecting to rejecting options restores the focus on negative information and attenuates the effect.

However, it is unclear whether individuals should stick exclusively to performing their designated tasks within the hierarchical leadership structure, or if, instead, they should switch between different types of tasks to align efforts with changes in the environment. We refer to such task switching-an individual shifting to or from tasks designated for a particular leader position-as leadership task transitions. Our qualitative study of six MTSs responding to live-actor mass-casualty incidents revealed that leadership task transitions are a double-edged sword as they can simultaneously help manage the MTS-environment interface and harm MTS internal functioning. More specifically, leadership task transitions benefit the MTS by rapidly reallocating effort to alleviate the dominant environmental pressure at that time. However, they also harm the MTS by disrupting its internal task-based cycles. Rapidly restoring the disrupted cycles mitigates this harmful effect, but such cycle restoration is not successful when there is a high level of cycle activity or when multiple areas of the MTS are disrupted. Our findings generate new knowledge on how and why leadership task transitions impact MTSs. Implications and future directions are discussed. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

Using irregular financial restatements as the negative integrity signals and prior alliance announcements as the positive capability signals, we find that investors react more negatively to restatements by firms whose alliance announcements are more salient-that is, the firms that announce more frequently and firms that create more positive expectations from those announcements.

Underlying this model is the notion that employees triangulate perceptions of pay secrecy (i.e., a pay-related procedural justice cue that also reflects uncertainty) with their own or others' perceptions of distributive justice as a basis for assessing organizational trustworthiness, with the latter serving as an important driver of voluntary turnover intentions and behavior. Results of two studies (Study 1 at the individual level and Study 2 at the firm level) indicate that, rather than being universal, the relationship between pay secrecy and turnover is contingent upon perceptions of distributive justice, with turnover intentions (at the individual level via organizational trustworthiness) and voluntary turnover rates (at the firm level) differentially affected by pay secrecy under conditions of higher and lower levels of distributive justice. These findings suggest an important extension to organizational justice theories; namely that, when procedural justice cues are confounded with uncertainty (as they are with pay secrecy), the assumed compounding interaction between procedural and distributive justice cues may be replaced by a more antagonistic interaction. © 2021 Academy of Management.

Empirically, we conduct a longitudinal analysis examining the ability of new private equity firms to raise a follow-on fund. Consistent with our theory, we find that unrealized performance, a relatively weak signal, positively influences fundraising.

Further, media attention strengthens the relationship between unrealized performance and fundraising, but media attention exerts less impact on the relationship between realized performance and fundraising.

This curvilinear effect was partially mediated by problem restructuring and the activation of new knowledge. We constructively replicated and extended the curvilinear effect in a field study with Korean employees: procrastination predicted lower task efficiency but had an inverted-U-shaped relationship with creativity. Employees who procrastinated moderately received higher creativity ratings from their supervisors than employees who procrastinated more or less, provided that intrinsic motivation or creative requirement was high. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for time management, creativity, and motivation in organizations. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Across three studies, we examine how disparities in funding outcomes may be due to differences in how entrepreneurs communicate their ventures, whereby female entrepreneurs have a tendency to use more concrete language when describing their ventures than their male counterparts. We find that the use of abstract speech affects investors' perceptions of which ventures are oriented toward long-term growth and scalability, which in turn affects the likelihood that a venture will receive investment.

Specifically, we hypothesize that processes characteristic of being embedded in a closed network are associated with a lack of foresight and a tendency to neglect long-run strategic planning. Using a probability sample of 700 CEOs in China, we show that network closure is associated with temporal myopia, which is evidenced in various measures of business planning. We show that managers embedded in closed networks are less experienced in long-run planning and are also less successful in implementing long-run business plans. Our contribution to the literature is twofold: we add a network perspective to the literature on temporal myopia in strategic management and, more significantly, by grounding temporal myopia in the network surrounding a person, we separate temporal myopia from the person. Myopia emerges from the social situations we create or in which we find ourselves. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

Few have captured the interactional dynamics between the two. This oversight tends to obscure how an extant collective action frame may shift or how a new one may arise during such interactions. To address this issue, we focus on movement-target interactions and illuminate the microfoundations of framing that produce a new collective action frame. Drawing on real-time participant observations, we examine how an unintended collective action frame emerged and escalated during a year-long interaction between the Occupy London movement and St. Paul's Cathedral, Church of England. Occupy protesters shifted from a ""capitalism is crisis"" frame targeting the U.K.'s financial establishment to a ""what would Jesus do?"" frame targeting the Church of England. We develop a process model based on the interplay of frame laminations and three situational mechanisms-emotional attachment to a frame, frame sacralization, and frame amplification-derived from an analysis of framing in movement-target interactions to explain the emergence and escalation of an unexpected collective action frame. © 2021 Academy of Management.

We advance this stream of research by examining the effects of using agency temps on business performance. We find first that, when otherwise identical workplaces make greater use of temporary help provided by agencies, the identification of the employee or “regular” workforce with their workplace declines because the perceived status of the workplace declines. This, in turn, leads to lower store-level service quality and sales. This effect is independent of the notion suggested in earlier studies that temp workers threaten the job security and opportunities for advancement of regular employees. Finally, we find that these negative effects can be mitigated by workplace-level strategies associated with shared instrumental values and social integration practices.

We introduce and define reaction costs as costs that signal senders incur when unintended audiences react negatively to a true signal that was intended for another audience. We argue that activist hedge funds-an unintended audience-treat CSR as a signal that firms have wasteful intentions and capabilities, which prevent firms from maximizing shareholder value in the short term. On that basis, we hypothesize that activist hedge funds are more likely to target firms with higher levels of CSR, thus imposing reaction costs on these firms. We further argue that this relationship is weaker when firms operate in industries with high levels of CSR, and stronger when firms' financial communication is vague. Using data on activist hedge fund campaigns in the U.S. between 2000 and 2016, we find supporting results. Our study shows that CSR signals may be costlier than previously assumed and contributes to research on CSR, signaling, and corporate governance. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

In three studies, we investigate how identity “asymmetries”—differences between teams in terms of whether the team or overarching system constitutes their primary focus of identification—affect interteam information sharing and performance. In Study 1, we manipulate teams’ foci of identification (team vs. system focused) in a sample of 84 five-member teams working in one of 21 four-team multiteam systems performing a computer strategy simulation. We find that, while system-focused teams shared information equally with all teams, team-focused teams shared less information with system-focused teams than they did with other team-focused teams. Interteam information sharing positively predicted interteam performance. In Study 2, we test the assumptions underlying our theory in a vignette experiment, demonstrating that team-focused individuals adopt instrumental motives toward interteam interaction. Finally, in Study 3, we investigate the implications of system composition in terms of team identity foci by means of a simulation study based on the empirical results of Study 1.

We apply this perspective to address a puzzle regarding director appointment in declining firms: Declining firms are often motivated to bring in director candidates with high resource endowments to help enact turnarounds, but these candidates may not join a declining firm's board due to the potential uncertainties and reputational loss of doing so. Drawing on the firm-director interdependence perspective, we predict that director candidates' social capital and human capital have inverted U-shaped effects on their likelihood of joining a declining firm. Moreover, the declining firm's organizational social capital differently moderates the effects of candidates' social capital and human capital.

An increasing body of cultural entrepreneurship research has highlighted an “optimal distinctiveness” trade-off: new ventures need to be distinctive from their peers to stand out, yet distinctiveness counteracts the attainment of organizational legitimacy. In this paper, we challenge the underlying assumption that distinctiveness necessarily counteracts the attainment of legitimacy and propose that distinctiveness can become a source of legitimacy. This proposition matters because it fundamentally alters the relationship between distinctiveness and resource acquisition from certain audiences. We build on these theoretical arguments to examine new ventures' resource acquisition from crowdfunders, one of the most important audiences for new ventures. Analysis of 28,425 crowdfunding campaigns across 39 market categories strongly supports our arguments, showing that higher levels of distinctiveness lead to superior crowdfunding performance. We further demonstrate that the legitimating effect of distinctiveness intensifies under the absence of alternative sources of legitimacy. Our study contributes by uncovering a new mechanism and three contingencies for the “optimal distinctiveness” trade-off. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

Results from an experience sampling study and a set of experimental studies showed that state positive affect fosters an optimistic state that promotes perceptions of justice rule adherence, which influences task performance and citizenship behavior, whereas state negative affect promotes a pessimistic state that promotes perceptions of justice rule violation, which influences counterproductive behavior.

It analyzes qualitative data on two transformation projects to implement kaizen (continuous improvement) collected from two manufacturing plants in a Chinese company. In both projects, material artifacts triggered social interaction, through which frontline employees were stimulated to focus on both performance and learning. However, in one project, the interplay of material artifacts that play multiple roles led to competing understandings of organizational objectives between managerial staff and frontline employees, which resulted in regression to the previous state where frontline employees focused exclusively on performance. In the other project, by contrast, the interplay of artifacts led to interrelating understandings of organizational objectives between these actor groups, which resulted in frontline employees’ constant acceptance of the learning–performance paradox. This paper contributes to extant literature by showing how the interplay of material artifacts that play multiple roles, such as triggering, supporting, disconnecting, and connecting, contributes to rendering paradox salient, as well as to creating organizational contexts for actors’ responses to it. © the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

When a firm ventures beyond these established roles, it often gets punished by its exchange partners. Our interviews in the Champagne grape market, however, suggest that some buyers are penalized more than others in such circumstances. Quantitative analysis confirms that nontraditional buyers receive price penalties for role deviations—through diversification, vertical integration, or disintegration—whereas traditional firms are treated more leniently. A subsequent interpretivist study, using interview data from 78 market participants to explore the exact mechanisms underlying this effect, reveals that sellers blame less traditional buyers when they cross the boundaries of their usual roles because they are thought to act out of volition and bad faith, whereas the same transgressions by more traditional firms are believed to have been necessitated by external circumstances. We conclude that the sanctioning behavior of actors in response to role transgressions by their exchange partners is driven by their interpretation of the motives underlying these transgressions, rather than by the actions themselves. As a result, nontraditional firms may find it difficult to deviate from the traditional roles in their industry. © 2020 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

Using a sample of 2,711 individual newcomers in 820 blue-collar teams tracked over seven years, we show that gender and age dissimilarity effects are not constant over time; rather, dissimilar individuals increase their absences more strongly over the years. Particularly, women and older employees in predominantly male and younger teams show a steeper increase in absenteeism over time and, accordingly, higher absolute absenteeism at later stages of team membership than do their less dissimilar counterparts.

We propose a two-stage theoretical model-first, a lead firm is selected to lead the alliance; second, the lead firm selects other partners-and we argue that political risk affects both stages. In the first stage, firms with knowledge of and influence in the project country are selected to lead projects in countries with high political risk. In the second stage, the lead firm selects a group of partners with knowledge and influence to ensure that the alliance-as a whole-has the resources needed in such countries. We also show, as a corollary, that the imperative to find these resources drives the lead firm to work with more-diverse multipartner alliances despite the higher coordination costs involved. We test our hypotheses by analyzing, first, the selection of the lead firm in 1,044 multipartner banking syndicates that financed some of the world's largest infrastructure projects in 68 countries between 2003 and 2012.

In this study, we use a micro-level approach to provide a better understanding of why outside directors have difficulty in monitoring the CEO. We highlight that an important reason for this lies in the boardroom dynamics associated with (a) outside directors' cognitive conflict with the CEO and (b) the chair's leadership of the board. Our inductive analyses of video observations of board meetings in five Australian corporations revealed the importance of chair participative leadership during disagreement episodes in the boardroom. Follow-up in-depth interviews of board meeting participants highlighted the importance of psychological safety as a key mechanism explaining why participative board chairs appear so effective in dealing with board-CEO cognitive conflict. We corroborate these results with a second, large-scale survey study involving data on 310 outside directors from 64 Dutch boards. Whereas prior work has mostly focused on the chair's relationship with the CEO, we instead highlight the importance of the chair's role as the leader of the board and identify board psychological safety as an important element shaping director monitoring within the confines of the boardroom. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

We explain how some environmental factors increase the state uncertainty associated with firms' dependence on government jurisdictions, whereas other factors increase response uncertainty. We hypothesize that, due to the historical influence of the media and social movement organizations on politics, negative national media tenor and oppositional social movement organization resources increase state uncertainty (i.e., government's likely behavior toward firms becomes less predictable), strengthening the relationship between firms' dependence on jurisdictions and their use of political contributions in those jurisdictions. Further, we hypothesize that top management team turnover and politician turnover increase response uncertainty (i.e., the effectiveness of firms' efforts to manage their dependence becomes less clear), weakening the relationship between dependence and political contributions. We find support for our theory in an examination of state-level political contributions of firms in environmentally intensive industries from 2009 to 2016.

While commonly interpreted in terms of an ""ex post settling-up""process that penalizes directors for failing in their role as monitors of management, the fundamentally social basis of the director labor market suggests that the ex post settling-up process may also incorporate a resource-provisioning role for directors as conferrers of legitimacy. We analyze how growing socioeconomic pressures that aim to redress the longstanding underrepresentation of female and ethnic minority directors may lessen, for these sought-after directors, the penalties typically imposed by the labor market in the aftermath of corporate misconduct.

One reason for this is that the conflict that arises in intercultural creative collaboration is a double-edged sword, and so how it is managed matters. In this research, we examine how the gender of collaborating dyads influences the link between intercultural conflict (task and relationship) and creative collaboration effectiveness. Through two studies (a laboratory study and a field survey), we found that intercultural task conflict has a negative effect on creative collaboration in men dyads but a positive effect on creative collaboration in women dyads. Conversely, intercultural relationship conflict has a negative impact on creative collaboration in general, but this effect is stronger for women dyads than for men dyads. These effects can be traced to how men versus women dyads handled intercultural conflict. There is also evidence that information elaboration (exchange, discussion, and integration of task-relevant information and ideas) mediates the effects of dyad gender and intercultural conflict on creative collaboration.

We then developed a theoretical model to examine possible challenges and benefits associated with this blended work–family experience and tested it with an experience sampling investigation assessing 106 women over 15 workdays in Study 2. Results suggested that breastfeeding interference increased negative affect and decreased positive affect daily, with negative affect hindering breastfeeding goal progress (i.e., ounces of breast milk produced at work) and work goal progress. However, positive experiences tied to breastfeeding enrichment decreased negative affect and increased positive affect, with positive affect increasing work–family balance satisfaction. Beyond these relationships, we explored effects associated with contextual features of breastfeeding at work—breastfeeding stigma, breastfeeding compassion, and quality of the breastfeeding space.

Being amplified was equally beneficial for voicers who framed their ideas promotively and prohibitively (improvement-focused and problem-focused, respectively; Study 1), and for men and women (Study 2). Furthermore, amplified ideas were rated as higher quality than nonamplified ideas. Amplification also helped amplifiers: participants reading experimentally manipulated meeting transcripts rated amplifiers as higher status than those who self-promoted, stayed quiet, or contributed additional ideas (Studies 1 and 2). Finally, in an intervention in a nonprofit organization, select employees trained to use amplification attained higher status in their work groups (Study 3).

In firms that have lower stakeholder orientation (defined as the extent to which management focuses attention on and integrates the interests of multiple stakeholders in its decision-making), divestitures will be less costly than the internal resolution of stakeholder conflicts, while the opposite will be true in firms that have higher stakeholder orientation. Consistent with this argument, we document a negative relationship between stakeholder orientation and divestiture activity, using a unique dataset of 909 U.S.-based, publicly listed firms from 2002 to 2015. This negative relationship is more pronounced for selloffs than for spinoffs, for selloffs of businesses that are unrelated to or located far from the divesting firm, and for selloffs to acquirers that are not alliance partners of divesting firms. The core contribution of this paper is to treat different types of divestitures as increasingly costly responses to conflicts among stakeholders, thereby populating the theoretical middle ground between negotiated adaptations of firms' governance structures and total firm failure. In so doing, this paper contributes to research at the intersection of stakeholder theory and corporate strategy. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

Yet these markets generate more internal rejections than matches, as not all internal applicants are hired. We develop theory to explain when rejections are more or less likely to deplete an organization's human capital resources through voluntary turnover. Drawing on the extant intraorganizational mobility literature, we argue that variations in post-rejection turnover are shaped by the information that the market provides employees about their likelihood of future internal advancement, despite being rejected in the present. Specifically, we argue that hiring manager decisions about whom to interview and hire provide information to rejected internal candidates about their ability to meet the criteria to be hired for similar jobs in the future and the likelihood that those jobs will be filled internally. Analyzing 9,355 rejections in a single firm over a five-year period, we find that rejected employees are significantly less likely to exit when they are interviewed by the hiring manager (compared to being rejected earlier) and when they are rejected in favor of another internal candidate (compared to an external candidate). © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

Drawing on relational self and self-affirmation theory, we argue that affirmation of team members’ social worth by trusted people outside the team helps them internalize an identity as a valued contributor, thereby reducing social acceptance concerns and facilitating information sharing in teams. We devised three intervention studies to demonstrate the causal effect of social worth affirmation in teams. In Study 1, senior executive teams in which members experienced social worth affirmation performed better (compared to control teams) on a crisis simulation that required information sharing in teams. In Study 2, with U.S. military cadets, we examined social acceptance concerns as a mechanism by which social worth affirmation influences information sharing. In Study 3, we showed that social worth affirmation improves virtual teams’ ability to share information by exchanging unique information cues. Our results suggest that affirmation of the social worth of team members through their personal relationships broadens their sense of self, thereby reducing their social concerns about being accepted by other members. This, in turn, leads to better information sharing in teams. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We propose and test hypotheses on such handoffs, focusing on how handing employees relatively mature ideas to implement may lead them to build less creative final products. We tested our hypotheses using two studies: an archival study of 5,676 movies in the U.S. film industry and a complementary experiment. Results suggest that late handoffs yielded less creative final products than no or early handoffs, meaning it was costly to creativity when employees implemented relatively mature ideas without driving at least some of their prior development. However, “serialized late handoffs”-wherein implementers were handed relatively mature ideas after an earlier handoff between two other individuals-were less costly to creativity than late handoffs from one other individual. Mediation results suggest that late handoffs reduced implementers' creativity by restricting their sense of psychological ownership and the coherence of their final products.

Guided by institutional theory, we focus on two important questions: (a) are the antecedents of restructuring common across downsizing and upsizing? and (b) are the performance consequences of such restructuring related to prior firm performance? To answer these questions, we use primary data from companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange over a 37-year period (1980-2016). Our results suggest that six key antecedents play a prominent role in both downsizing and upsizing, although they differ in magnitude and direction in how they affect each form of restructuring. However, in both instances they reflect efficiency considerations (company performance and managerial foresight), as well as institutional forces (the economy, political uncertainty, industry, and technology), just as neo-institutional theory suggests. In addition, prior performance plays a central role in restructuring decisions, in both the upsizing and downsizing of assets and employees. The evidence suggests that it is not just current-year performance but also the trend in company performance over the prior two years that forecasts subsequent firm performance; thus, our findings extend and refine institutional theory. © 2021 Academy of Management.

This paper examines the performance effects of underdog expectations, defined as individuals’ perceptions that others view them as unlikely to succeed. Integrating theory and research on self-enhancement with psychological reactance, I predict that underdog expectations have the potential to boost performance through the desire to prove others wrong when others’ credibility is in question. Studies 1 and 2 provide support for the positive relationship between underdog expectations and performance. Study 3 reveals support for the positive effect of underdog expectations on performance through the desire to prove others wrong. Study 4 demonstrates that these effects depend on the perceived credibility of observers: when observers’ expectations are seen as more credible, underdog expectations undermine performance (consistent with the Golem effect and self-fulfilling prophecy), but when observers’ expectations are viewed as less credible, underdog expectations boost performance (demonstrating the underdog effect). My theory and results challenge the assumption that perceiving low expectations from others is always detrimental, and offer meaningful insights into why and when underdog expectations increase versus inhibit performance.

Using multimethod data from a local microbrewery, we develop and test theory about the reputational implications of customers' involvement in a corporate community engagement initiative. Our results suggest that customers' engagement in such initiatives is related to positive views of the organization (i.e., corporate reputation), as well as positive customer behaviors-brewery patronage and purchases-two years later. Moreover, it appears that customers spread this sentiment to others-creating the potential for an even broader audience to see the company as reputable and, in turn, provide support. © 2020 Academy of Management.

To answer this question, we use longitudinal data on the organization Villages for Africa that introduced ""macrocredit""loans to rural Tanzanians that would enable them to establish their own village enterprises. Several years after the implementation of the idea, it collapsed. Our findings allowus to make two key contributions. First, we provide a process model of high-distance translation that shows howproponents can strategically introduce an idea across highly different contexts by ""culturally detaching""it from its institutional origins, leading to the idea being ""culturally assimilated""into the recipient context. However, although cultural detachment and cultural assimilation indicate the successful translation of an idea, the means of doing so can later prompt its rejection. We call this the ""reactance effect""of translations across highly different contexts. Second, we showcase the role of history for translation theory more generally. History-particularly the historical relationship between the sociocultural categories of the mzungu (Swahili for ""foreigner"") and the villagers-influenced the way in which the macrocredit idea could be introduced to villagers and played a key role in its subsequent rejection.  © 2021 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Although scholars have suggested that side-hustles conflict with full-time work performance, we assert that psychological empowerment from side-hustles enriches full-time work performance. We argue that sidehustle complexity-the motivating characteristics of side-hustles-positively relates to empowerment and that side-hustle motives moderate this relationship. A study of 337 employees supports these assertions. We then investigate the spillover of sidehustle empowerment to full-time work performance in a 10-day experience-sampling method study of 80 employee-coworker dyads. We address an affective pathway in which daily side-hustle empowerment enriches full-time work performance through side-hustle engagement and positive affect at work. We also consider a cognitive pathway wherein side-hustle empowerment distracts from full-time work performance through side-hustle engagement and attention residue-persistent cognitions about side-hustles during full-time work. Overall, performance enrichment from side-hustles was stronger than performance conflict. We also consider affective shift from full-time work to side-hustles, finding negative affect from full-time work strengthens the relationship between side-hustle empowerment and engagement. Combined, our two studies examine the source of side-hustle empowerment and how side-hustle empowerment influences affective and cognitive experiences during full-time work. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

No longer can employees reliably predict when and where their coworkers will work, transforming the very ways in which coworker relationships unfold over time. This is perhaps especially true for coworker multiplex relationships, which fuse a coworker relationship with a friendship relationship and strongly affect job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Through a qualitative study of a Fortune 500 technology firm with a largely remote workforce, we build theory on how virtual coworkers form friendships with each other on the path to multiplexity. Our emergent theory reveals the centrality of “relational cadence”—perceived convergence in the patterns of interaction between oneself and a particular coworker—to the establishment and growth of these relationships. It also differentiates work-related from friendship-related cadence, stresses the symbiosis of these cadences in multiplexity, and emphasizes the importance of temporal rhythm and understanding relational particulars (the nature of the specific coworker relationship) in the development of each form of cadence.

Building on a six-month autoethnography of a consulting assignment, we show that authority is a practical, relational, and situated performance. It exists in a tension between two mirroring processes—activation and passivation—through which relations are either leveraged or downplayed to shape the situation and steer collective action. Our study also reveals that the performance of authority involves not just people, but also a broader range of actants, including artifacts and abstract entities.

Specifically, we theorize how internal firm dynamics and performance are affected by resource dependence by integrating resource orchestration (RO) into RDT. Building on RO, we argue that as the degree to which a firm is dependent upon a single source of revenue increases (a core tenet of RDT), the firm adjusts internally by reducing investments and the market responds negatively as well. Further, we argue that the heterogeneous nature of such dependence-namely, dependence scope (the spread of dependence throughout the entity with which the dependence relationship resides), dependence supplementation (the addition of new relationships within the prior dependence relationship), and dependence stability (the expected length of the dependence relationship)-moderates the relationship between the level of dependence and these outcomes. We find broad support for our theorizing in a longitudinal sample of manufacturing firms' dependence upon governmental contracts for revenue.

We build new theory on why justice social comparison perceptions influence employee behavior (specifically, helping and instigated incivility) by viewing the phenomenon through a self-regulatory lens. Doing so enables us to identify a novel explanatory mechanism and boundary condition for these effects.

Drawing on the concept of temporal focus, we theorize that present-focused CEOs adhere to the BAM's endowment effect, while exhibiting even stronger relationships between current and prospective wealth and risk taking. In contrast, by nature of being forward-looking, future-focused CEOs endow prospective wealth instead of current wealth, thereby reversing the main relationships of the BAM.

The subsequent path that their voice takes-that is, increasing in a virtuous positive trajectory or decreasing in a vicious negative trajectory-is determined by whether their proactive personality matches their supervisors'. For instance, when paired with supervisors who are not similarly proactive, they confront low congruence on change-related goals in the working relationship; hence, rather than building off their initial voice and developing a positive voice trajectory, frustration might lead their voice to decay in a negative trajectory. This theory is supported in a sample of 403 newly formed dyads. Employees higher in proactive personality were more likely to speak up to their supervisors immediately after beginning to work together. Supervisor-employee congruence in proactive personality predicted how voice changed in the dyads in the ensuing six months.

Drawing upon expectancy theory (Vroom, 1964) and the heuristic processing literature (Kahneman, 2011), we examine the relationship between PFP and employee helping behavior. We perform this examination not only by considering the “pay” component (e.g., PFP intensity) but also by scrutinizing the “performance” component; namely, performance subjectivity, which refers to the extent to which the criteria or indicators used to measure employee performance in the performance appraisal system are subjective. Specifically, we propose that PFP has a conditional positive effect (i.e., in the context of high performance subjectivity) on employee helping behavior, and further theorize and test the underlying psychological mechanism by which individual perceived helping-performance expectancy accounts for the interactive effects between PFP and performance subjectivity on employee helping behavior. The empirical results of three studies employing distinctive methodologies provide general support for our hypotheses.

The stakeholder preservation perspective suggests that positive market reaction to an acquisition stems from potential new value creation by honoring implicit contracts and maintaining good relationships with target stakeholders. By contrast, the stakeholder appropriation perspective posits that positive market reaction is primarily derived through wealth transfer to acquirers by defaulting on implicit contracts with target stakeholders. Using a data set of acquisitions in the United States, we find that target corporate social responsibility is positively associated with acquirer abnormal returns upon an acquisition announcement. Moreover, stakeholder value congruence between the merging firms strengthens this positive relationship, whereas business similarity between them weakens it. These findings align with the stakeholder preservation perspective and challenge the stakeholder appropriation perspective. r Academy of Management Journal","",""
"MAKING CHANGE from behind A MASK: HOW ORGANIZATIONS CHALLENGE GUARDED INSTITUTIONS by SPARKING GRASSROOTS ACTIVISM","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091199820&doi=10.5465%2fAMJ.2017.0507&partnerID=40&md5=5c041847bd009dc15f9ef8139e58c138","We examine how organizations can challenge institutions that are coercively protected by powerful elites—guarded institutions—when they are unable or unwilling to advocate publicly against them. To do so, we draw on an in-depth qualitative study of efforts to combat child marriage in Indonesia. We explore how an international children’s rights organization worked alongside local nongovernmental organizations and activists to disrupt the institution of child marriage through two discrete strategies: the crafting of an alter ego that takes the appearance of a social movement that has emanated from the grassroots but is actually highly organized, and the use of this alter ego to support the incubation of public dissent by means of a high-stakes event. We contribute to the literature by developing a theorized account of how organizations can challenge guarded institutions when they cannot speak out—an important organizational problem that has received limited attention. We also challenge the theoretical distinction that has been drawn between the organizational mobilization of activists, often referred to as astroturfing, and seemingly organic mobilization that is said to emerge at the grassroots level. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

Although prior studies have examined the role of supply-side factors such as technologies, capabilities, and managerial cognition, they rarely explore how demand-side factors such as customers can shape managerial cognition and firm search behavior. Extending the attention-based view to the demand side, we argue that major customers channel the attention of executives to the existing competitive environment, resources and capabilities, and management practices (i.e., existing-oriented attention), resulting in firms' increased emphasis on deep search within familiar domains and limiting their search in new fields. Through an empirical examination of the patenting behavior of U.S. publicly listed firms, we show that customer concentration increases search depth and decreases search breadth via executives' existing-oriented orientation. We also find that both performance feedback above social aspiration levels and product market competition amplify the effects of customer concentration. Our study contributes to the organizational search literature by adding a demand-side explanation. It also extends the cognition view by foregrounding the role of customers in shaping executive attention. Moreover, it explores the interaction between supply- and demandside factors in driving firm search behavior.  © 2021 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We test our theory in the context of academic scientists where collaborations within and across organizations are common channels to access complementary assets. We find that cross-organizational collaborations are positively related to an individual's decision to move to a previous coauthor's organization. Additionally, moving to an organization where an individual had a direct collaboration is positively related to postmobility performance. This suggests that prior collaboration facilitates better employer-employee matches. We unpack this finding and show that the postmobility performance increase is not only driven by increased productivity with prior coauthors, it is also driven by novel collaborations with new colleagues. Together, our findings suggest that cross-organization collaborations facilitate hiring employees who can integrate well with the complementary assets of the entire unit. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

Prior research has focused primarily on pyramid-shaped formal hierarchies, despite documented limitations of the pyramid structure. We adopt a multi-method approach to consider the utility of alternative hierarchical shapes. First, we identify six “pure type” formal hierarchies that teams might employ. Next, we develop three propositions explaining the effects of hierarchy on team members’ cognition and behavior. We use the propositions to parameterize an agent-based computational model in which formal hierarchical differentiation influences team performance by creating power imbalances that affect team members’ perspective-taking motivation, and by influencing members’ social identification with the team. The modeling results reveal how the effects of the six hierarchies are contingent upon task characteristics that influence team members’ perspective-taking accuracy (e.g., task variety), and enable us to craft an expanded, team-level theory of the association between formal hierarchical differentiation and team performance. A field study of 68 clinical nursing shifts in five mid-sized hospitals supports a key theoretical prediction. Specifically, we find that a negatively skewed (inverse pyramid–shaped) formal hierarchy enhances team performance relatively to a positively skewed (pyramid-shaped) hierarchy when task variety is high, but not when task variety is low. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

It suggests that organizational status is more likely to be a liability than an asset when alleged violation is part of a multiple-actor scandal. Specifically, an alleged violation by a high-status organization is more likely to be labeled as misconduct when that violation is part of a multiple-actor scandal compared to when it is a standalone violation. This is because multiple-actor scandal triggers sociopolitical mechanisms that decrease the protective benefits of status and augment the potential hazards of status, making status a liability during a multiple-actor scandal. Focusing empirically on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the focal social control agent and on the SEC enforcement action as labeling of misconduct, we find that status in itself neither protects nor exposes organizations to the enforcement action, but that status increases the likelihood of the enforcement action when misconduct is part of a multiple-actor scandal. © 2020 Academy of Management.

We explore how internal fragmentation—that is, the existence of multiple coalitions within a partner organization, each with different interests and perspectives—influences the evolution of relational characteristics in interorganizational relationships. Based on a longitudinal case study of a dyadic strategic alliance, we develop a process model, describing how internal fragmentation within one of the partner organizations can lead to a counterintuitive relational pattern—namely, “dual relational dynamics”—where decision makers of both partners continue renewing their formal commitments, while simultaneously experiencing negative trust dynamics. We show that the existence of different belief systems within one partner organization can lead to a politically charged process, wherein different coalitions within this organization frame and act upon interorganizational events in different ways. This politically charged process can fuel both hope and disappointment among decision makers of both partner organizations, leading to dual relational dynamics. Our findings contribute by advocating a political perspective on interorganizational relationships. We also demonstrate the relevance of this political perspective by showing how it challenges the dominant notion of interorganizational relational dynamics as reinforcing spirals. r Academy of Management Journal","",""

In this project, we shed light on this question by exploring how social movement boycotts that challenge a firm’s social responsibility affect board turnover. We find that boycotts provoke a significant increase in turnover at targeted firms, and that directors are especially likely to leave after boycotts that signal that the firm’s social values conflict with their personal values. Specifically, we find that an ideological match between a board member and the activist challengers predicts exit: liberals are more likely to leave after liberal challenges and conservatives are more likely to leave after conservative challenges. Moreover, we show that turnover is consistent with the rigidity of the right hypothesis in political psychology: conservatives, as compared to liberals, are more prone to entrenchment when their firms face challenges from the opposition. Our study offers strong evidence that corporate social performance matters to corporate directors, and provides insights into the manner in which contentious crises affect the motivation of corporate insiders. r Academy of Management Journal","",""

I further examine how these mechanisms explain firms' intermediary choices in response to government regulations. Using a novel dataset of power plants across China, I find that the theorized intermediation mechanisms and the ways in which firms assess them are partially bounded by institutional complexities. Firms' inexperience with regulations and their adoption of novel technologies are positively related to those firms' selection of public intermediaries, with the former relationship strengthened when regulatory changes suggest a continuous need for policy updating. Meanwhile, firms' noncompliance records and a lack of institutional linkage to the government are positively related to their reliance on private intermediaries' buffering competency, with the latter relationship evident only in settings with an interventionist government.

Recently, though, hackathons have turned the journey into an ad hoc sprint of only a couple of days using new tools and technologies. Existing research predicts that such conditions will result in a failure to produce new working products, yet hackathons often lead to functioning innovative products. To investigate this puzzle, we closely studied the product development process of 13 comparable projects in assistive technology hackathons. We found that accelerating innovation created temporal ambiguity, as it was unclear how to coordinate the challenging work within such an extremely limited and ad hoc time frame. Multiple projects worked to reduce this ambiguity, importing temporal structures from organizational innovation processes and compressing them to fit the extremely limited and ad hoc time frame. They worked in full coordination to build a new product. They all failed. Only projects that sustained the temporal ambiguity-by working with a minimal basis for coordination and allowing new temporal structures to emerge-were able to produce functioning new products under the intense time pressure.

We examine two types of social influence behaviors displayed by new CEOs: (1) ingratiation toward predecessor CEOs and (2) self-promotion. We create proxies for such behaviors using a computer-aided content analysis of transcripts of new CEOs’ conference calls with securities analysts. We find that ingratiation toward predecessors reduces the adverse impact of predecessors’ remaining as board chairs while self-promotion mitigates the negative impact of negative stock market reactions.

However, we lack understanding of the spatial aspects of such institutional struggles.

We draw on an in-depth longitudinal analysis of the material, social, and symbolic aspects of the spatial dimensions of disruptive and defensive institutional work over the past 20 years in Venezuela’s art world. Following the start of the Bolivarian Revolution in the late 1990s, the incoming government transformed the organization of the national cultural landscape, resulting in a prolonged period of institutional disruption and defense.

Our qualitative study of entrepreneurs in the sex industry in Canada reveals that the many constraints faced by entrepreneurs in stigmatized industries also create opportunities. Actualizing such stigma-based opportunities loosens the constraints of stigma and enables entrepreneurs to experience structural, cognitive, and emotional emancipation.

We hypothesize that lowerstatus firms tend to bring higher-status alters into ventures on a better performance trajectory, whereas higher-status firms tend to bring lower-status alters into poorly performing ventures. Furthermore, we argue that these effects will be moderated by market heat, which affects whether investors would focus on the upside or downside of deals. We test our hypotheses in a longitudinal analysis of venture capital syndication patterns in the United States between 1990 and 2017.

Three key motors and their attendant feelings drive discovery via abduction sequences: surprise, doubt, and inquiry. Second, I provide a methodology for use in future research on discovery.

We introduce a broader relational approach and draw on high-quality connections and resourcing theories to examine how a swift SOC emerges. Utilizing rich data sources, our qualitative analyses present a swift SOC cultivated in five days in a sleepaway summer camp.

Resourcing artifacts creates scaffolds that mobilize actors to create a web of connections, leading to an organization-wide swift SOC. We propose that a swift SOC can emerge through four intertwined resourcing artifact phases: initial resourcing, embracing resourcing, reinterpreting resourcing, and expanding resourcing. During these phases, individuals imbue artifacts with new meaning and resource artifacts for (a) dyadic connection, (b) staff coordination, and (c) membership in a subgroup and (d) an organization-wide community.

Recent research, however, has suggested that the benefits of feeling trusted are accompanied by strains, which some employees may be unwilling to bear. Drawing on seminal theorizing on fairness, we propose that employees will perceive their supervisors as being more mindful of their needs-acting more fairly-when there is a fit between trust wanted and trust received, even when the fit is at low levels of trust. By extension, when trust received exceeds or falls short of an employee's desire for trust, the employee should perceive the supervisor as less fair.

The study builds on the assumption that individuals in knowledge-intensive workplaces employ dissonant ties to access distinct work-related benefits, and establishes a link between dissonant ties and performance. Subsequently, it provides an indepth analysis of employees' willingness to rely on this potentially unpleasant but instrumental networking behavior, and suggests that formal hierarchical rank, tenure, and unit membership, as critical elements of the organizational architecture, drive dissonant tie formation. In the empirical analysis, the study utilizes survey and interview data collected from engineers in a large manufacturing firm. The findings confirm that seeking problem-solving assistance from difficult colleagues entails performance benefits. Moreover, the embeddedness of individuals in the organizational architecture shapes the employment of dissonant ties. Dissonant ties are, hence, context driven. By simultaneously addressing the consequences and the drivers of employees' networking behavior, the study presents a comprehensive theory of dissonant ties that challenges and refines previous research on the interplay between positive and negative networks.  © Academy of Management Journal.","",""
"Maintaining strategic ambiguity for protection: Struggles over opacity, equivocality, and absurdity around the sicilian mafia","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091200610&doi=10.5465%2fAMJ.2017.1086&partnerID=40&md5=4917b48ef10a13e6fb6fa613075955b8","In spite of an increasing interest in ambiguity, our knowledge of how organizations maintain strategic ambiguity to protect themselves from public scrutiny is still in its infancy. Through an in-depth historical study of the Sicilian Mafia between 1963 and 2018, we develop a model of strategic ambiguity maintenance. We focus on three struggles between the Mafia and state representatives, and show how these struggles centered on different types of ambiguity: ambiguity as opacity, equivocality, and absurdity. We elaborate on the strategies enacted by the Mafia and the responses by state representatives and their implications for ambiguity over time. The main contribution of our paper is that it advances understanding of the maintenance of strategic ambiguity by organizations that need to protect themselves from public scrutiny. More specifically, it enriches our knowledge of the key process dynamics, the types of struggles, and the discursive and nondiscursive strategies employed in the process. Our analysis also extends research on clandestine organizations and illuminates the relationship between (strategic) ambiguity and secrecy. © of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

However, their effects on performance are not straightforward, as they can provide new firms with advantages (enhanced coordination and cooperation) as well as disadvantages (reduced diversity, nepotism concerns, and the possible spillover of personal conflict). As kin ties may have both positive and negative implications for performance, a contingency approach to the performance of new firms is valuable. We develop such an approach by relating different structural configurations of kin ties-whether they are between founders, between founders and employees, or between employees-to the performance of new firms. We test our predictions using data on 4,967 new firms founded in Stockholm between 1998 and 2003.

The bulk of research in this domain has addressed issues regarding the accrual of HC stocks. However, there has been a dearth of research exploring the underlying mechanisms through which accrued HC stocks translate to competitive advantage. We expand on Wolfson and Mathieu's (2018) human capital resource complementarity (HCRC) theory by incorporating the deployment of human capital resources (HCRs) as well as the role of social capital resources (SCRs) in the form of members' shared team task-specific experience in predicting performance. We empirically test HCRC theory-derived hypotheses using a sample of 448 cyclists from 17 world teams who competed in 26 races during the 2015 season of the Union Cycliste Internationale World Tour. Our results revealed that higher-level HCR stocks indirectly led to deployed HCR performance through deployed HCR alignment with situational characteristics. Furthermore, SCRs acted as a critical boundary condition for the value of aligning deployed HCRs with situational characteristics such that the alignment of deployed HCRs was only advantageous when paired with relatively high levels of SCRs. Implications for future theory building, research, and practice related to HCR deployment are discussed. © 2021 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

On the one hand, maintaining commitments to transgressors poses negative spillover risks, so theories posit firms are more likely to avoid such risks by ending commitments as negative spillover rises. On the other hand, exchange relationships often create embedded value, so theorizing also posits firms are more likely to avoid risking loss by maintaining commitments as relationships are more embedded. We argue this “maintain or end” choice oversimplifies a complex situation in which there are mixed gambles (i.e., choices offering both positive and negative outcomes). We integrate theorizing on mixed gambles and negative spillover to develop a broader conceptualization of alternative strategies for firms to reconcile these risk trade-offs beyond a binary “maintain or end” reaction, theorizing firms may: (a) increase or decrease commitments to transgressors, (b) hedge against risks by adding new partners while maintaining existing ones, or (c) “boomerang” by restarting exchange after previously ending commitments. Using firms' relationships with politicians accused of misconduct to test our arguments, findings support our theorizing. Collectively, we offer a more complete understanding of firms' reactions to exchange partner misconduct, extending theory and practical knowledge in multiple ways. © 2020 Academy of Management.

Challenging this, we argue that family motivation is a double-edged sword with both an energizing and a debilitating effect on employee performance, depending on the performance criterion in question. Specifically, drawing upon self-determination theory and the “hard work versus smart work” framework, we hypothesize that family motivation is positively related to employee productivity via enhanced work effort (i.e., energizing effect). However, family motivation also stimulates employees to see their jobs as a means to gain financial support for their family, rather than an end in itself, which is associated with lower levels of creativity (i.e., debilitating effect). We further propose that employees' family motivation is higher when they experience higher levels of family financial pressure, and that financial pressure is more strongly related to family motivation for women than for men. We find support for our hypotheses in a sample of 187 low-wage, blue-collar workers and a sample of 439 relatively high-income, white-collar employees. We also conduct a qualitative study with 40 high-income employees; results provide a more nuanced understanding of the ways in which family motivation shapes perceptions of the job and subsequent behaviors and outcomes. © 2020 Academy of Management.

We advance and test a theoretical perspective to explain when and how practice prevalence may also generate a ""weakness in numbers"" effect. Specifically, to explain the diffusion of reverse mergers-a controversial practice that allows a private firm to go public by merging with a publicly listed ""shell company""-we suggest that prevalence affects their diffusion in a complex way based on two divergent social influence pathways, creating (a) a direct, positive effect of practice prevalence on potential adopters, who view prevalence as evidence of the practice's value; and (b) an indirect, negative effect mediated through third-party evaluators (i.e., investors and the media), who view prevalence as a cause for concern and skepticism. We also highlight the utility of this theoretical framework by analyzing how a decline in the status of past adopters exerts a negative effect on diffusion through both social influence pathways. Employing structural equation modeling techniques, we find support for the hypothesized relationships, and we discuss the implications of the study for future research on practice diffusion. © 2021 Academy of Management.

We complement this research by developing theory on vicarious learning to explain how a firm adjusts its own exploration level based on the exploration levels of its alliance partners and competitors. Using panel data on 180 electronics firms publicly traded in the United States, we reveal an inverted U-shaped association between a firm’s exploration tendency and the exploration levels of its partners and competitors. Convergence is explained by imitation and legitimation, while divergence is associated with risk perception and specialization in the knowledge domain. We further show how the convergence of the exploration tendency becomes stronger under firm-specific uncertainty but weaker when the exploration patterns exhibited by the firm’s partners and competitors are incoherent. Finally, counter to expectations, we show that this convergence is weakened by the technological proximity of the firm’s competitors. Our findings inform research on vicarious learning and the antecedents of exploration by underscoring the role of interdependence in firms’ exploration tendencies. r Academy of Management Journal","",""

To address this research gap, we developed a dual-agency model incorporating both public agents (government officials) and private agents (corporate CEOs) to investigate when firms respond to government initiatives by increasing their CSR. We tested our model in a sample of 746 Chinese listed firms during the period 2009-2014 when a national CSR initiative, the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, took place. Our results show that firms responded positively to the plan by increasing their CSR performance, but their response varied according to the incentives of both public and private CSR agents. Firms were more likely to increase CSR when public agents were more motivated to seek promotion to the central government or when private agents had greater concerns for legitimacy. Our examination of the role of two different types of CSR agents within institutions contributes to the institutional view of CSR by highlighting the interplay of institutions and human agents in promoting firm CSR. It also advances public policy and managerial practices regarding the development and selection of CSR agents inside and outside firms in a given institutional environment. © 2020 Academy of Management.

While highlighting the effects of a reputation for good behavior, however, prior work has largely overlooked the possibility that a reputation for bad behavior is qualitatively distinct. In addition, we know that organizational reputation is multidimensional. Although this is conceptually intriguing only if different types of reputation produce different effects, concurrent tests of such differences are rare. In response, we study the effects of multiple reputations for bad behavior on the media coverage of a serious error by a firm. Due to the need for the news to be new, we predict the media is more likely to cover errors that supplement a firm's general character reputation, but will likely ignore errors that are redundant given a firm's specific capability reputation. We test this theory in the context of 113 major oil spills in the United States, from 1985 to 2016. Results confirm the theorized contrasting effects. Counterintuitively, we also find the media is even less likely to cover repeat offenders that cause larger spills. We conclude that, at least for media coverage of oil spills, being bad can have its benefits for firms. © 2020 Universidad de Antioquia. All rights reserved.","",""

However, existing theory is unclear on when and why some cover-ups are punished less severely by in-group third parties compared to out-group third parties. Drawing on theories of attribution and social identity, we theorize that the punishment of cover-ups by in- and out-group third parties depends on the type of cover-up: specifically, whether individuals conceal their own unethical transgressions (personal cover-ups) or the unethical transgressions of another individual (relational cover-ups). By highlighting this distinction, we hypothesize and find across three studies that in-group third parties punish relational-but not personal-cover-ups less severely than out-group third parties.

Constructed from intersubgroup comparisons, activated team faultlines likely result in ambiguous or illegitimate status perceptions. Thus, activated faultlines threaten team justice climate, which drives status conflict, impairing team performance. We explore the effects of team structure clarity in providing certainty or legitimacy around status and structure, ameliorating the negative effect of activated faultlines on team justice climate. We test our model using a multi-source (three sources), multi-wave cross-lagged design (four waves) on a sample of 271 employees and 41 leaders in 41 teams. We find that the negative relationship between activated faultlines and team performance is mediated by the team justice climate–status conflict causal chain.

Our findings indicate that emotional control allows organizations to deal with contradictory logics and achieve their desired constellation, while unbidden emotions disrupt local efforts and enable changes in desired constellations of logics. Further, systemic power mediates the very experience of logics and the prospects of changing their constellation: Social asymmetry necessitates harder emotion work on behalf of the underprivileged, differentiating their experience of logics, and limiting the extent to which emotional eruption is a viable option.

Resolution of these competing claims is especially important in the context of strategic decision making, where the costs of unreliable learning are significant. We develop theory and draw on a unique dataset of strategic decisions—the selection of franchisee applicants by a large global remittances firm over a 14-year period—to test competing predictions about how long it takes to get to the learning curve; that is, to the point after which performance trends reliably positive.

We develop the argument that while conformity in CSR scope enhances analyst coverage, differentiation in CSR emphasis leads to more-favorable analyst recommendations and higher market value. This suggests that firms may be able to simultaneously conform in CSR scope and differentiate in CSR emphasis to achieve optimal distinctiveness. To further enhance our understanding of the variation in the relationship between conformity and differentiation and the response of analysts and the market, we investigate how some firm- and analyst-level factors moderate this relationship. Using the case of corporate social activities of Chinese listed firms during the period from 2008 to 2014, we show that scope conformity has a stronger effect on analyst coverage for state-owned firms and firms with higher visibility; on the other hand, the relationship between emphasis differentiation, and analyst recommendation and market value strengthens for firms covered by high-status brokerage houses but weakens for those experiencing high earnings pressure. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

The model emerged from a qualitative inductive study of professionals whose career identities had been affirmed by achieving early career success recognized by a 40 Under 40 Award. Identity affirmation often sparked career and family identity threat that individuals resolved through time-bending sensemaking. During times of family focus, early achievers attained a sense of dual identity affirmation by believing that they had in the past (identity residue), or would again in the future (identity projection), focus on the career role, mitigating career identity threat. During periods of career focus, they similarly projected future or remembered past family involvement to mitigate family identity threat. Early achievers also found more fleeting ways to maintain their identities in identity bursts that helped them resolve threat to their career or family identity while the other was taking precedence. Three identity patterns emerged: identity bursts anchored chronic accelerating, while residue was key to lane switching; seasonalizing was anchored by both residue and projecting.

The current study proposes another important but neglected antecedent of cultures: a leader’s past cultural experience. Specifically, we theorize that group leaders enact cultures based on their past cultural experiences, essentially transferring cultures from their former groups to their current groups. Two studies, one in the field (Study 1) and another in the laboratory (Study 2), reveal that the levels of cultural tightness in current groups are predicted by group leaders’ past experience with cultural tightness in their former groups in which they were followers. This relationship becomes stronger when the group leaders identified with or had longer tenure in their former groups. In addition, the cultural tightness that leaders transferred from their former groups to their current groups influences negative (counterproductive work behavior) and positive (promotive and prohibitive voice) forms of group deviance.

We argue that rival firms with common ownership structures will engage in dissimilar competitive action repertoires to avoid direct competition with each other. Competing aggressively, but with dissimilar action repertoires, allows rivals to maintain high levels of performance. Competing with dissimilar action repertoires also helps ensure that performance disparity between the two firms remains low.

We extend the notion of a “legitimacy threshold” to develop and test a recursive model of legitimacy. Whereas extant research has focused on whether entrepreneurial endeavors garner sufficient support from key audiences to cross this threshold, we argue that the order of magnitude by which they succeed or fail is also consequential for later entrants. Distinguishing “blockbuster” from “unsung” successes, and “path breaking” from “broken path” failures, we contend that recent successes and failures affect related subsequent endeavors in predictable, though sometimes counterintuitive ways. We test our hypotheses by examining 182,358 entrepreneurial endeavors pitched within 165 categories over a six-year period on Kickstarter, one of the most important crowdfunding platforms.

We argue and empirically verify that high CEO–CFO language style matching reflects CFOs’ strong attempts to ingratiate themselves with CEOs. Because ingratiation with superiors can lead to the superiors’ positive evaluations of subordinates, CFOs who exhibit higher language style matching with CEOs will receive higher compensation and are more likely to become board members of the associated firms. In addition, the proposed relationships will be stronger when CEOs are more powerful. Yet, in the presence of high CEO–CFO language style matching, CFOs are less likely to voice different viewpoints and challenge CEOs in strategic decision processes. As a result, firms tend to undertake more mergers and acquisitions, and such mergers and acquisitions will be paid with a low percentage of cash (vs. stock) and realize lower announcement returns. Using a sample of over 2,000 U.S. firms from the period 2002–2013, we find empirical support for these predictions. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

However, in many cases the ethnic community influences the investment choice of the same firm in one location but not another. We offer an institutional lens to explain this heterogeneity. Ethnic groups function like informal institutions that facilitate transactions between foreign firms and customers, suppliers, and information providers through interpersonal exchange. Relying on ethnic communities to mediate transactions in foreign markets is valuable but limited by the relatively small scale of these communities. In contrast, relying on formal institutions allows firms to expand more broadly into foreign markets because the impersonal exchange inherent in formal governance is more scalable. This is manifested in “dual entry strategies” wherein ethnic communities have a significantly stronger influence on location choice in places with unreliable (weak and unstable) formal institutions than in places with reliable formal institutions. We found support for these ideas using a unique dataset of South Korean banks’ investments in Chinese provinces during 1992–2013. To mitigate endogeneity concerns, we exploited a historical migration that created a quasi-random distribution of ethnic Koreans across provinces.

We traced action paths using longitudinal field data from a videogame development project, and found that action patterns change dramatically over time based on the needs of the project. We explain these changes in terms of generic mechanisms that lead to the enactment of more (or fewer) paths in the narrative network.

To assess this possibility, we draw on social exchange theory and the agency model of narcissism to investigate how team narcissism composition affects team coordination and performance. Our model was tested using game-level longitudinal data from National Basketball Association teams. Teams with higher mean and maximum levels of narcissism as well as higher narcissism members in core roles (i.e., central and influential roles) had poorer coordination and in turn performance than teams with lower levels. In addition, having higher team familiarity amplified the effects of narcissism for team mean and core role narcissism. The nature of the observed interaction, however, was surprising. Originally, we hypothesized that narcissism would lead to greater decrements in coordination as familiarity increased. Instead, we found that teams with higher mean and core role narcissism maintained the same levels of coordination over time, whereas teams with lower narcissism experienced improvements in coordination. Thus, team-level narcissism appears to prevent teams from capitalizing on normative coordination gains that occur as familiarity increases. These results underscore the importance of considering narcissism when forming teams. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

Through an ethnographic study, we investigated how tea producer organizations in eight communities in East Africa confronting severe resource constraints acted for sustainable development. We discovered that a “present” time perspective is richer than has been described previously. Prior time research has described the present as a “moment” in time, which allows managers to juxtapose the present against the future to make the intertemporal trade-offs for sustainable development. However, our tea producers did not see the future as a trade-off with the present. We discovered that they see duration in the present—what we call a “long present.” Because the present is long, they see connections among processes such as resource flows, which inspired incremental actions that continuously ease extreme resource shortages.

Drawing from social psychology literature on stereotypes, we argue that two fundamental dimensions of social perception—warmth and competence—help explain the underlying processes and conditions under which CSR leads to specific outcomes. We propose that firms engaging in CSR are perceived as higher in warmth and, by default, competence; moreover, different perceptions of the organization’s warmth and competence can moderate CSR rewards and CSI penalties. To demonstrate this, we conduct three experiments. Experiment 1 links CSR with perceptions of warmth and competence, showing that warmth perceptions mediate the relationship between CSR and important outcomes, such as purchase intentions and reputation. Experiment 2 adds information on firms’ countries of origin, revealing that CSR rewards and CSI penalties differ depending on the (mis)alignment of CSR strategy with country stereotypes. Experiment 3 replicates these findings using behavioral paradigms. We find that firms from high-warmth countries (the United States, Sweden, Portugal) receive lower CSR rewards and pay higher CSI penalties than firms from low-warmth countries (Germany, Pakistan) but this effect is moderated by competence.

Our findings show that working through these tensions on specific tasks enables actors to legitimate the sustainability strategy in action and to co-enact it with the mainstream strategy within those tasks.

Grounded in these findings, we make two contributions. First, we challenge the orthodox view of entrainment as an ideal synchronous relation between organizations and their environments.

When groups are scrutinized, we theorize that decision makers strive to match the diversity observed in peer groups due to impression management concerns, thereby conforming to the descriptive social norm. We examine this first in the context of U.S. corporate boards, where firms face pressure to increase gender diversity. Analyses of S&P 1500 boards reveal that significantly more boards include exactly two women (the descriptive social norm) than would be expected by chance. This overrepresentation of two-women boards—a phenomenon we call “twokenism”—is more pronounced among more visible companies, consistent with our theorizing around impression management and scrutiny. Experimental data corroborate these findings and provide support for our theoretical mechanism: decision makers are discontinuously less likely to add a woman to a board once it includes two women (the social norm), and decision makers’ likelihood of adding a woman or minority to a group is influenced by the descriptive social norms and scrutiny faced.

While some argue that high-status transgressors attract severe punishment when accused of ambiguous transgressions, others contend the opposite. In this paper, we attempt to reconcile this theoretical inconsistency. We propose that the capacity for social status to color third-party judgments of transgressions may depend on the status type of high-status actors. Drawing on the evolutionary theory of dominance and prestige as two alternate forms of status within social hierarchies, we suggest that actors associated with dominance-based status will be penalized more harshly than actors whose status is based on prestige. Across multiple studies employing archival field data, controlled lab experiments, and different instantiations of dominance, prestige, and misconduct, we consistently demonstrate that high-status dominant actors are punished more harshly than their prestigious counterparts. Further, we find that attributions of intentionality and lack of moral credentials explain the harsher punishments meted out to dominant (vs. prestigious) high-status actors. In this way, we provide both a parsimonious reconciliation of the inconsistency in the extant literature and a theoretical explanation of how status type of high-status actors differentially impacts the judgment, decisions, and behaviors of third parties. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

Mandated change, imposed by a powerful external actor, extends understanding of the dynamics of radical change. While other studies have examined how unintended consequences shape the way radical change is realized, under mandated change, actors focus on bringing about the change in ways that will be, collectively, considered to realize the intended mandate. Our study, grounded in a practice approach concerning how actions bring about radical change, identifies three different action cycles: performing action cycles, reinforcing action cycles, and reflecting action cycles. Shifts in cycles are triggered by unintended consequences that escalate into breakdowns.

As a result, managers can remain in the dark about issues that are otherwise well known to, or universally understood by, frontline employees. We propose a previously unexplored explanation for this phenomenon: Voice is prone to “bystander effects,” such that, the more certain information is shared among employees, the less any particular employee feels individually responsible for bringing up that information with managers. We theorize that such bystander effects are especially likely to occur when peers of focal employees, on average, enjoy high-quality relationships with managers and thereby have adequate relational access to voice up the hierarchy. Using a correlational study involving managers and employees working in teams in a Fortune 500 company, as well as two experimental studies (a laboratory study involving undergraduate students working in a hierarchical setting, and a scenario study with a sample of U.S.-based workers), we provide evidence for our conceptual model. We also discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of our findings. r Academy of Management Journal","",""

However, since not all ventures achieve their desired goals through collaboration due to uncertainty, such relationships are sometimes abandoned. This paper investigates the costs of ties that have gone awry in the context of venture capital investments. We conjecture that the adverse perceptions of signals associated with tie discontinuation reduce an investee venture’s valuation in the follow-on round of financing by partially deterring prospective investors, particularly higher-quality ones, from joining the syndicate. By examining large-sample evidence that supports our theory, we suggest that early entrepreneurial ties to venture capitalists may be a double-edged sword, especially in light of the costs of tie discontinuation. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

Yet, theory remains sparse about the importance of verbal behaviors for emergent leadership in self-managed teams over a team’s lifecycle. Adopting a functional perspective on leadership, we develop a temporal account that links changes in task-, change-, and relations-oriented communication to emergent leadership in early, middle, and late team phases. We test the hypothesized relationships in 42 teams that provided round-robin emergent leadership ratings and videotapes of their first, midterm, and final meetings. Team members’ verbal behaviors were captured using fine-grained empirical interaction coding. Multilevel modeling showed that task-oriented communication was a stable positive predictor of emergent leadership at all time points. Change-oriented communication predicted emergent leadership at the start of a project and diminished in relevance at the midterm and final meetings. Relations-oriented communication gained importance, such that an increase in relations-oriented behaviors toward the project end predicted emergent leadership. We discuss theoretical implications for conceptualizing the behavioral antecedents of emergent leadership from a time- and context-sensitive perspective. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

When it comes to forecasting the value of one’s own innovation ideas, however, people may err systematically. In this paper, we shed light on this ideator’s bias, and examine when and why certain ideas are more prone to biased evaluations. Specifically, we argue that biased idea evaluations depend on the self-efficacy that ideators may derive from their specific role and social identity in the firm when generating a specific idea. We test our theoretical predictions of such a situation-specific perspective on overconfidence by using a corporate dataset on process innovations and their valuations. Furthermore, we triangulate our predicted mechanism and rule out alternative explanations through a series of additional interviews and four scenario-based experiments. Consistent with our situation-specific, identity-based account, we find that ideas from employees at a higher (vs. lower) organizational level, and from employees generating ideas in groups (vs. individually) are more prone to an ideator’s bias. In doing so, our study helps explain when the ideator’s bias prevails in a real-life organizational context, raises caution about some current proxies to identify high-potential ideas, and provides fresh insights to established theories around overconfidence and self-efficacy.

It is unclear, however, whether performance pressure serves as a productive or unproductive strategy for producing beneficial work behavior. Our research provides clarity on the dynamic nature of performance pressure. We theorize that reactions to performance pressure are influenced by daily fluctuations in how the pressure is appraised, and these fluctuations explain why performance pressure can be a double-edged sword, producing bright and dark side effects for organizations. We predict that, on a daily basis, performance pressure may be appraised as a threat, which promotes self-regulation depletion that explains dysfunctional behavior (i.e., incivility); daily performance pressure may also be appraised as a challenge, which elicits engagement that explains enhanced task proficiency and citizenship. Trait resilience is predicted to moderate these effects, promoting performance pressure to be appraised as a challenge rather than a threat, which then mitigates the depleting effects that produce dysfunctional behavior and enhances the engaging effects that produce functional behavior.

The position that actors occupy in the status hierarchy has been shown to be an important determinant of these decisions. The dominant hypothesis, known as “middle-status conformity,” posits that middle-status actors are more likely to conform to conventional practices than high- and low-status actors do. We challenge this hypothesis by revisiting its fundamental assumptions and developing a theory according to which actors’ propensity to conform based on their achieved status further depends on the ascribed status that they inherit from their social group. Specifically, we propose that middle-status conformity applies only to actors who have a sense of security, based on their high ascribed status. Regarding actors with low ascribed status, we propose that high- and low-status actors show greater conformity than middle-status actors.

We counter this view with a consistent, motivation-based logic in the theory: low-performing firms are fixated on finding short-term solutions to immediate problems, so they have an increased probability of exhibiting deviant risk-taking behavior such as bribery, whereas high-performing firms are concerned about sustaining their competitive advantage in the long run and will more likely engage in aspirational risk taking such as research and development (R&D). Using a sample of 9,633 firm-year observations covering 2,224 listed companies in China, we find that, as a firm’s performance falls further below its aspiration level, it has larger abnormal entertainment spending, an implicit measure of bribery expenditure, but not higher R&D intensity.

Prior research has explained this puzzling phenomenon predominantly through an “actor-centric” perspective, proposing that managers’ just behavior is an outcome of their own individual differences. This paper shifts the locus of theorizing away from managers to their organizational context by arguing that managers’ adherence to principles of justice is often influenced by two key contextual features—workload and rewards. Drawing on the multiple-task pursuit framework, we propose that under high workloads, just treatment of employees often competes with other managerial tasks. We further argue that organizations implicitly and explicitly signal to managers that acting justly is not as important as their other technical tasks. Hence, managers who face high workloads (i.e., high amounts of work and time pressures) tend to prioritize other technical responsibilities at the expense of acting justly, unless explicitly rewarded otherwise. We find support for our theorizing across three studies (an experience sampling study, a field study, and an experiment).

This study builds on power theory to develop and test a model of founder exit using a dataset of 313 founders from 177 entrepreneurial IPOs between 2002 and 2010. We largely find support for the model—a negative relationship between founder power and full exit. To capture the underlying mechanism of the power–exit relationship, we conducted two experiments in which we randomly assigned decision makers to either a high- or low-power condition. We find that decision makers in the low-power condition are more likely to use a full exit via IPO than those in the high-power condition, and that frustration mediates this relationship. However, founders can also engage in partial exits, including a managerial partial exit in which the founder leaves management but keeps ownership, and a financial partial exit in which the founder divests ownership but remains in management. We find that the negative relationship between founder power and exit is more negative for full exits than for partial exits.

Introducing the theoretical perspective of ecological rationality, we challenge this view and argue that, under conditions of uncertainty common to managerial decision making, managers can actually make better decisions using fast-and-frugal heuristics. Within the context of personnel selection, we show that a heuristic called Δ-inference can more accurately predict which of two job applicants would perform better in the future than can logistic regression, a prototypical rational strategy. Using data from 236 applicants at an airline company, we demonstrate, in Study 1, that, despite searching less than half of the cues, Δ-inference leads to more accurate selection decisions than logistic regression. After this existence proof, we examine, in Study 2, the ecological conditions under which the heuristic predicts more accurately than logistic regression using 1,728 simulated task environments. Finally, in Study 3, we show in an experiment that participants adapted their strategies to the characteristics of a task-and increasingly so the greater their previous experience in selection decisions.

We develop a theoretical model of relational reconciliation that traces how agents engage with this identity threat in an ongoing, stumbling process. Through relational reconciliation, agents come to redefine their selves in relation to their “socializees,” which enables them to engage in elaborated socialization practices that aim to meet the needs of both the organization and the socializee. Our work repositions socialization agents as active parties in socialization, explores the tensions of socializing members of marginalized groups into a dominant culture, and reveals the importance of engaging with one's own identities to reconcile these tensions. © Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

While scholars have started to explore how entrepreneurs convey their passion and preparedness in a pitch, they have overlooked the possible variation that exists in entrepreneurs’ verbal and nonverbal expressions. We build on research in cognitive science and entrepreneurship to examine the nature and influence of specific forms of speech and gesturing used by entrepreneurs when pitching. In an initial qualitative field study we identify distinct pitching strategies entrepreneurs use, involving different combinations of verbal tactics (i.e., using literal and figurative language to frame a venture) and gesture (i.e., using different types of hand gestures to emphasize parts of their pitch and convey product and venture ideas). In a subsequent experimental study, we examine the impact of these strategies on investors’ propensity to invest. We find that, although variation in the type of language used by an entrepreneur has limited effects, using gestures to depict and symbolize business ideas has strong positive effects. Our findings indicate that the skilled use of gestures by entrepreneurs helps potential investors imagine aspects of a new venture for themselves, thereby enhancing perception of its investment potential. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

Despite this interest, scholars have little understanding of the impact birth order has on CEOs and their strategic decisions. With this in mind, we develop theory that explains how CEO birth order may be associated with strategic risk taking. Drawing from evolutionary theory arguments related to birth order, we theorize that CEO birth order is positively associated with strategic risk taking; that is, earlier-born CEOs will take less risk than later-born CEOs. As evolutionary theory proposes that birth order effects are driven by sibling rivalry, we also argue that this relationship is moderated by three factors related to sibling rivalry: age gap between a CEO and the closest born sibling, CEO age, and the presence of a sibling CEO. Our results provide support for our theorizing and suggest that birth order may have important implications for organizations.

We argue that negative media reactions to the announcement of a major acquisition will shape the degree to which the firm will engage in subsequent acquisition activity. However, our theory suggests that an important individual attribute, CEO temporal focus, will influence how sensitive CEOs are to media coverage. Using a sample of 747 large acquisitions made between 2006 and 2011, we find strong support for our hypotheses. Additionally, our supplemental analysis demonstrates an important difference between the influence of stock market and media reactions following an acquisition.

Both projects structured collaboration around the development of boundary objects that could integrate actors’ expertise. In both projects, however, the objects sparked conflicts that exacerbated rather than attenuated differences. I develop a process model exploring how and why the development of boundary objects can manifest as divisive conflict that derails collaboration. In both projects, extreme novelty gave rise to concept ambiguity, a lack of shared ideas about what smart cities were, and process ambiguity, a lack of shared ideas about how smart cities should be developed. Ambiguity led actors from diverse domains to form divergent cognitive representations about smart cities. As they developed boundary objects, actors made decisions that violated some cognitive representations, while re-ifying others into material outcomes. Their efforts to develop the objects manifest as matter battles: high-stakes conflicts about material outcomes that, over time, set the stage for collaboration failure. In advancing these ideas, I provide an alternative perspective to the literature on collaboration across boundaries, which has primarily treated boundary objects as tools of integration rather than weapons of division. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

Building on intertemporal choice theory, we theorized and tested how a focal firm’s temporal framing of its competitive action announcements affects rivals’ response speed. We examined three dimensions of temporal framing: temporal vagueness (lack of clarity and completeness regarding timelines), temporal distance (length of the action timeline: proximal versus distal), and frequency (repetition of vagueness and distance cues). Based on analysis of 2,130 competitive action press releases of 28 duopoly firms from 14 industries, we found that the temporal framing dimensions, both individually and interactively, were related to the response speed of rivals. Specifically, temporally vague and distally framed timelines in action announcements delayed rivals’ response speed, and increased frequency of vagueness and distance cues strengthened these effects.

Hence, the present investigation integrates dynamic logic, theory, and methodology from the discipline of developmental psychology-wherein the nature of the topic has necessitated a more careful examination of change over time-into the organizational literature.

First, we extend theory that has thus far been primarily used to explain intraindividual development in children to detail three testable principles of dynamism in team properties. Second, and utilizing a within-construct logic, we demonstrate that teams are indeed dynamic systems, but that the extent to which any particular team property may be considered dynamic is contingent upon characteristics of the property itself.

Taking an uncertainty perspective and integrating social identity theory with depletion research, we theoretically and empirically examine the role of social identification in multiteam system performance. In contrast to general assumptions in the literature regarding the need to develop identity at the highest level of a system, we argue that within a multiteam system, identification with that system negatively relates to multiteam system performance, whereas identification with the component team positively relates to multiteam system performance. Our uncertainty perspective suggests that identification with the multiteam system introduces uncertainty regarding the appropriate norms and interdependencies in the system, which leads to more depletion, and consequently lower system performance. Conversely, identification with the component team offers less uncertainty, resulting in less depletion and higher multiteam system performance. Thus, our integrated theoretical framework suggests that depletion mediates the negative effects of multiteam system identification and the positive effects of component team identification on multiteam system performance. Moreover, consistent with our uncertainty perspective, the indirect effect of identification on multiteam system performance via depletion is stronger when task complexity is high and weaker when task complexity is low. © 2019 Academy of Management.

Thus, capability reputation has a buffering effect on relationship formation. In contrast, current exchange partners attend more to the firm’s character reputation than its capability reputation following adverse events.

A qualitative study of a child welfare agency found that members organized themselves to avoid the conscious experience of psychological distress. Distress organizing involved, first, the use of collective avoidance mechanisms that constrained the time, space, and impetus for members to experience the distress of their work; and, second, patterns of interpersonal avoidance that prevented relationships in which such experiencing could occur. The mutually reinforcing, cumulative effect of distress organizing sharply reduced members’ emotional availability to clients and coworkers, which manifested as largely dispassionate responses to others’ distress. Dispassionate responding led to emotional isolation and emotional exhaustion, with which members coped by further avoidance of others. Distress organizing thus amplified rather than ameliorated distress. Amplification processes were temporarily suspended when agency members momentarily created conditions for providing and receiving compassion. These findings contribute to theory about social contexts of psychological distress in organizations, the alleviation of such distress, and the bases of organizing processes.

We pivot from this predominant focus to a focus on the detriments of transformational leader behaviors for leaders themselves. Drawing from conservation of resources theory, we propose that although transformational leader behaviors produce gains for both leaders and followers, those behaviors also trigger losses for leaders themselves. The results of two experience-sampling studies, whereby leaders and their followers completed weekly surveys for six weeks, revealed that transformational leader behaviors were associated with increases in leader emotional exhaustion and subsequent leader turnover intentions, and these detrimental consequences occurred over and above benefits to followers (Study 1) and benefits to leaders themselves (Study 2). Furthermore, the extent to which transformational leader behaviors were associated with increases in emotional exhaustion depended upon attributes of followers, such that leaders experienced greater increases in emotional exhaustion when their transformational leader behaviors were directed toward followers low in conscientiousness (Study 1) and competence (Study 2). Overall, our work provides answers to both why and under what conditions the dark side of transformational leader behaviors is likely to appear. r Academy of Management Journal","",""

So far, however, studies shed limited light on board-internal challenges and dynamics in such difficult times, thus providing few insights into the conditions under which boards may contribute to organizational inertia. We use a comparative case study of 10 major Swiss electric utility companies during the energy transition to show in detail how environmental and strategic change impair boards’ ability to judge strategic issues, and how boards use self-evaluation and self-reconfiguration to renew this ability. Moreover, we offer original insights into the board-internal antecedents of board renewal, and show that environmental discontinuities pose a dilemma for boards, since self-evaluation and self-reconfiguration are critical for preventing organizational inertia yet may run counter to board members’ self-interest. By showing that board members, like managers, experience conflicts of interest that can harm firm performance, our study contributes to agency theory and an emerging micro-perspective on boards. Moreover, by highlighting boards as a source of organizational inertia, our study challenges existing findings in the field of strategic management and makes several more specific contributions to important debates in the corporate governance literature. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

However, little is known about how the stability of the firm’s ego-network composition affects the firm’s innovation. In this paper, we investigate the outcomes of ego-network stability in an alliance context, arguing that stability actually reduces innovation for the focal firm. We further investigate two contingencies—namely, the structural holes the focal firm spans and the geographic concentration of its inventive activities—that moderate the detrimental innovation effects of ego network stability. Focal firms can limit the negative effects of ego-network stability on innovation by spanning structural holes in their alliance portfolios, whereas the negative effects are worsened when the focal firms’ inventive activities are geographically concentrated in a single country. We empirically test our hypotheses using 198 biopharmaceutical firms headquartered in the United States over a 21-year period from 1985 to 2005.

Drawing theoretically from the person–organization fit and social capital literatures, we theorize that the integration and utilization of external hires will correlate with two types of human capital resource fit: similarity and complementarity, and two dimensions of retained social capital resources: internal and external. Using data from the U.S. lobbying industry and novel empirical estimates of worker–firm fit, we provide descriptive evidence that employee utilization (performance) decreases post-mobility, consistent with the portability paradox. However, this relationship attenuates—in magnitude and duration—when there is human capital resource complementarity (but not similarity) between the employee and hiring firm or when the employee transfers social capital resources (internal or external). We also find some evidence that human capital and social capital function as substitutes, and post hoc analyses suggest the characteristics of human and social capital which facilitate the utilization of external hires also correlate with hiring firm performance. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

In this paper, we intend to fill this gap by explicitly differentiating between the effects of diversity in TMTs and MMTs. By matching various firm-level and individual-level datasets, we compile a linked employer–employee panel dataset for Sweden for the period 2004–2012. Focusing on measures of educational diversity, we find that the effects differ considerably between MMTs and TMTs.

Contributing to the employee- organization relationships and workplace emotions literatures, perceived exploitation is defined as employees' perceptions that they have been purposefully taken advantage of in their relationship with the organization, to the benefit of the organization itself. We propose and find that such perceptions are associated with both outward-focused emotions of anger and hostility toward the organization and inward-focused ones of shame and guilt at remaining in an exploitative job. In two studies including construction workers and a time-lagged study of medical residents, we find that the emotions of anger and hostility partially mediate the effects of perceived exploitation on employee engagement, revenge against the organization, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions, whereas the emotions of shame and guilt partially mediate the effects of perceived exploitation on employee burnout, silence, and psychological withdrawal. © 2019 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Recent theoretical work has suggested that contract frames influence the relationship between contracts and trust. We test and extend this theorizing by examining the effects of prevention and promotion contract frames on trust and some potential cognitive and emotional mechanisms responsible for them. We also explore how unexpected negative events affect trust developed under different contract frames. Experiment 1 found that promotion contracts fostered stronger attributions of benevolence than prevention contracts, but emotional experiences of the exchanges did not differ. Additionally, trusting intentions were higher following positive exchange experience under promotion than prevention contracts. Experiment 2 found that people were more willing to engage in trusting behavior following positive exchange experience under promotion than prevention contracts. However, violations of exchange expectations were more damaging to trust developed under promotion than prevention contracts. Together, the studies indicate that contract frames and whether exchange experiences are positive or negative affect the relationship between contracts and trust, likely because contract frames influence attributions of benevolence. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

This phenomenon has been linked to direct benefits to entrepreneurial firms, offering valuable knowledge and routines obtained by employees during their tenure at incumbent firms. We propose a theoretical framework in which shared experience—a common background in beneficial knowledge management practices—creates a “cohort effect,” facilitating direct ties and innovation benefits to new ventures receiving inventors from the same incumbent firms. Analyzing longitudinal data on inventor migration to 658 new biotech ventures tracked from 1990 to 2013, we find shared migration ties increase knowledge and market overlap between firms, enhancing their likelihood of direct engagement through alliances and employee hiring as well as the quality of knowledge they develop. Our core theoretical contribution is the identification of a migration cohort effect, in which inventors who share contemporaneous experiences at incumbent firms and migrate to new ventures create unique relationships between those ventures. Where prior research on spawning and migration has focused primarily on the direct benefit of human capital transfer from incumbents to new ventures, we explore the broader network implications of similarities and interactions between firms receiving this human capital. © 2019 Academy of Management.

Accordingly, we hypothesize that leaders that communicate visions of change can address this resistance by assuring followers that the essence of the organizational identity will remain unchanged—making their vision of change also a vision of continuity. In line with our proposition that collective continuity is valued because it serves an uncertainty-reduction function, such visions should be more predictive of vision effectiveness the higher follower work-related uncertainty.

Our results show that headquarters display lower levels of uncertainty aversion than do subsidiaries, but all organizations generally make greater shifts in attention toward alternative courses of action if they possess complementary experience and access shared experience. We test these ideas using a sample of U.S. electric utility companies attending to renewable technologies from 2000 to 2010—a market greatly affected by regulatory uncertainty.

Extending previous research, we predict that creation (dissolution) of both friendship ties and advice ties are negatively (positively) related to subsequent thoughts of quitting. We then develop and test the novel hypotheses that for friendship ties, thoughts of quitting are positively related to tie retention and negatively related to tie creation (leading to network stasis), whereas for advice ties thoughts of quitting are negatively related to tie retention and positively related to tie creation (leading to network churn). In a longitudinal network analysis that assessed 121 employees across three time points, we find support for our hypotheses that thoughts of quitting affect network changes, but do not find that network changes affect thoughts of quitting. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

While it has been suggested that various benefits can be derived from shared ownership, cooperatives are often characterized by conflict among members that, in turn, can lead to eventual failure of the cooperatives. Existing theory has suggested that the choice of formal control structure can play an important role in mitigating conflict, but a longstanding debate exists as to whether flat versus hierarchical control structures are more effective. To add further insight into this theoretical discussion, we conducted a field experiment involving 40 newly formed cooperatives in rural Ghana, which were randomly assigned to either a flat or hierarchical control structure. The quantitative results of our field experiment and subsequent qualitative data suggest that formal hierarchical control structures lead to lower levels of collective psychological ownership, which in turn result in higher levels of conflict compared to flat control structures within cooperatives. However, our results also suggest that the extent to which the choice of formal control structures influences conflict among cooperative members can be highly dependent on the absence or presence of an informal hierarchy. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

If a contributor submits an idea to an organization for the first time (i.e., is a newcomer), and the organization does not select the idea, this may negatively affect the newcomer’s relationship with the organization and willingness to submit ideas to the organization in future. We suggest that organizations can increase newcomers’ willingness to submit further ideas by providing a thus far understudied form of feedback: rejections. Though counterintuitive, we suggest that rejections encourage newcomers to bond with an organization. Rejections signal contributors that an organization is interested in receiving their ideas and developing relationships with them. To test our theory, we examine the crowdsourcing of 70,159 organizations that received ideas from 1,336,154 contributors. Using text analysis, we examine differences in how rejections are written to disentangle the mechanisms through which rejections affect contributors’ willingness to continue to interact with an organization. We find that receiving a rejection positively impacts newcomers’ willingness to submit ideas in future. This effect is stronger if the rejection includes an explanation and is particularly pronounced if the explanation matches the original idea in terms of linguistic style. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

In this paper, we consider differences in identity across category members, and ask how these relative differences determine their response to a code-violating change. Taking a case where category members are identified as “insiders” and “outsiders,” we argue that insiders’ reaction to a code violation depends upon the extent to which they believe their identity is distinct from the code violator’s, who might be an insider or an outsider. We suggest that it is the presence or absence of an “identity buffer”—i.e., a relative identity advantage—that determines insiders’ reaction. We hypothesize that when a fellow category insider introduces a code violation, the focal insider will be more likely to refrain from the practice. When an outsider introduces the violation, insiders will be more likely to adopt the violation provided they can retain an identity buffer. We posit that when outsiders adopt code-preserving behavior, thus narrowing the identity buffer between insiders and outsiders, it will mitigate insiders’ likelihood of code violation adoption.

Consequently, decision makers use one of two contrasting decision rules when responding to inconsistent feedback: problem solving or self-enhancement. So far, disparate theoretical logics and mixed evidence has limited our understanding about when decision makers shift their attention from positive to negative aspects of inconsistent feedback, or vice versa, and increase or decrease their research and development (R&D) search. We examine how different types of chief executive officer (CEO) power explain why some firms may respond to inconsistent feedback-that is, positive performance feedback and negative prospects-in distinct ways. We find that firms engage in less R&D search as a response to inconsistent feedback when CEOs have high levels of structural, ownership or expert power. In contrast, when CEOs have high levels of prestige power, firms undertake more R&D search as a response to inconsistent feedback.

Shifting the perspective from what rivalry does to what it prevents from doing, we conceptualize rivalry as a system of relational constraints that extends beyond the level of direct rivals. Using qualitative and quantitative data on the mobility of jockeys in the Palio di Siena (1743–2011), the famous horse race in Siena, Italy, we document relational gaps in the mobility network—career moves that do not occur, even if expected on economic grounds. The analysis shows that rivalry constrains not only the moves to rivals but also to allies of rivals and rivals of allies. The effect becomes stronger over time, attesting that relational constraints persist in developed markets. Our fieldwork reveals that the constraining ability of rivalry is based on conformity to expectations of loyalty and adherence to group identities. The observed relational gaps are pertinent not only to scholarship on rivalry but also to mobility and network research. r Academy of Management Journal","",""

We reconcile the contradictory predictions of collective turnover research—that any type of worker’s exit impairs organizational performance—and of contingent work research—that temporary workers’ exits improve organizational performance because they provide flexibility. We argue that the planned turnover of temporary workers has an inverted U-shaped relationship with unit performance because it combines flexibility benefits and disruption costs. We also argue that the costs of planned temporary worker turnover are moderated by the proportion and the firm-specific experience of their replacements. We test these arguments using longitudinal monthly data from a leading multinational company in the food and beverage industry, and find support for our hypotheses.

Agency theory typically prescribes the use of stock options, or other outcome-based contractual arrangements, to overcome the critical issue of information asymmetry. We theorize that this arrangement, which leaves information asymmetry in place, provides CEOs an informational advantage that can be used, via impression management techniques, to circumvent some of the intended benefits of option grants. Specifically, we argue that the period leading up to an option grant creates a scenario where CEOs are incentivized to reduce the stock price of their firm for personal gain. Our results suggest that CEOs respond to this incentive by adjusting the tenor of releases from the firm during the pregrant period, providing CEOs a substantial economic gain. We also show that underpaid CEOs and CEOs with higher discretion pursue this activity more frequently. Our findings highlight a critical challenge of agency theory: if information asymmetry remains, a motivated CEO can often circumvent the contractual arrangements intended to mitigate that very problem.

This can pose an existential threat to ventures, yet it is unclear how they might manage this problem. To explore this important phenomenon, we conduct a qualitative process study of the Impossible Project, a photography venture that encountered significant resistance from its user community as it pivoted from an analog focus to an analog–digital positioning.

Because rivals are embedded in dyads, triads, tetrads, etc., amultilevel view can unearth awareness cues that specify a hostility profile and make the awareness construct prescient. Studying thousands of competitive encounters over 10 years, we show that, at the firm and dyad levels, diversification and asymmetric pressure (differential exposure to competitive pressure) are reliable cues predicting competitive encounters. At the network level, convergence drives triadic encounters (competitionwith a rival's rival), and the degree of separation among indirect competitors defines the outer bounds of the hostility profile. Specifically, direct rivals and second- and third-degree indirect competitors merit awareness-more distal players do not. Together, the awareness cues and hostility profile delineate the conceptual bound within which awareness is prescient and beyond which it is misplaced.

Past research has approached this question mostly by treating emotional displays as static and focusing on the overall or average levels of displayed emotions. However, emotional displays are temporally dynamic and more salient in some moments or phases than others. Drawing from gestalt characteristics and event system theories, we take a dynamic approach to examine the ""peak"" moments of entrepreneurs' displayed joy-specifically, the strength and duration of peak displayed joy during different phases of a pitch. We analyzed data from over eight million frames in 1,460 pitch videos, using the latest facial expression analysis technology. The findings unveil the benefit of pitching with a greater level of peak displayed joy, especially during the beginning and ending phases of a pitch. Moreover, the amount of time an entrepreneur spends at the peak level of his or her displayed joy has an inverted U-shaped relationship with funding performance. This research highlights not only the importance of investigating emotion temporal dynamics in the interpersonal context, but also the unique research opportunities provided by facial expression analyses in understanding complex management phenomena. © 2019 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We posit that the social audience in general, and people working in organizations in particular, sort organizations into categories (“organizational forms”) and rely on knowledge of the taken-for-granted external identities of firms in these categories to interpret their experience as employees. Although many of these interpretations revolve around size, categorical distinctions between “small” and “large” firms pack concepts and ideas that extend significantly beyond a simple distinction based on size, and would be better understood as an organizational form distinction between specialist and generalist firms. Focusing on the organizational form of a specialist, we claim that two features of its form identity work against each other to influence turnover: employees of specialists realize that it is hard to develop careers internally (a push factor) but value the more relaxed environment, meaningful work, and flexibility of their jobs (a pull effect). We propose a theory to parse out the two effects, find empirical support for it in analyses of managerial turnover in the Korean TV advertising industry, and conclude that the construct of organizational form offers an opportunity to extend models of career mobility and individual turnover. © 2019 Academy of Management.

Following a Bourdieusian tradition, one account—which we label “self-reproduction”—points to the catalyzing effect of social proximity in shaping recognition along relational lines. Drawing from recent scholarship on social evaluation, a second account—which we call “intellectual distance”—suggests that social proximity deters recognition. We probe the influence of different articulations of social proximity (i.e., direct ties, cliquishness, and reciprocity) on recognition by studying awarding decisions within the context of the Norwegian advertising industry. Interviews with key informants as well as econometric results suggest that, while self-reproduction tends to prevail over intellectual distance, these effects coexist and their relative influence varies across levels of recognition. We gauge the relative saliency of the two accounts by using a mixed methods approach.

First, we outline “polysemy” and “polyphony” as mechanisms that dynamically engage conflicting logics through an organizational–individual interplay. Borrowing from paradox theory, we explain how hybrids can empower individuals to fluidly separate and integrate logics when neither structural compartmentalizing nor organizational blending is feasible because management cannot prescribe a specific balance of logics. Second, we explain the state of “elastic hybridity,” constituted through the recursive, multilevel relationship between polysemy and polyphony. Elastic hybrids maintain unity in diversity. They are capable of institutionally bending without organizationally breaking and thus enable individuals to practice more of their personal convictions at work while still experiencing a sense of shared organizational purpose. Third, we show how contested hybrids can be made to last. By dynamically making logics either less central or more compatible, elastic hybrids become less conflict prone and more resilient without permanently becoming more aligned or estranged. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

Drawing on observation and interview data from an intervention that fostered positive change in the relational dynamics of a global distributed team, this paper theorizes the mechanisms that enabled a move toward positive relational dynamics. We find that the intervention brought about relational changes by not only creating spaces where the team could experiment with new forms of interaction, but also by utilizing “interaction scripts”—concrete guidelines for interaction that specify content parameters and participation rules. We establish that the combination of spaces and interaction scripts was critical for helping the team enact counter-normative forms of interpersonal sharing that led to the emergence of positive relational dynamics. While existing research has highlighted the importance of spaces for enabling positive relational change, this paper theorizes the complementary role that interaction scripts can play in the change process.

On the one hand, CEOs may pursue strategic actions because they are confident they will enhance firm value. Alternatively, CEOs may take actions even when they have low confidence in the value of those actions, perhaps driven by self-interest or social pressures. Although research suggests that CEO option exercises following an acquisition announcement are an ex post behavioral outcome of low CEO confidence in the acquisition’s value-creation potential, prior research has not identified any ex ante signals shareholders can look for to assess acquiring CEOs’ confidence when the acquisition is announced. We address this concern by exploring a potential early warning signal of low CEO confidence: impression offsetting. We theorize that impression offsetting—measured as other unrelated positive announcements made by the firm in the days immediately surrounding the acquisition announcement—may serve as an ex ante signal of low CEO confidence in the acquisition’s value-creation potential, and, as such, will be positively associated with CEO option exercises, an ex post behavioral outcome of low confidence. We test our theory with a sample of 491 large acquisitions and find consistent support for our hypotheses. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

This study focuses on theoretical and empirical distinctions between the different potential organizational reactions to failure (in this case around new product development) and how those feedback-driven choices aggregate to affect firm performance. To understand when and why negative feedback is organizationally beneficial, we focus on how possession of domain-specific experience affects the way in which firms interpret and respond to negative feedback, offering both organization- and mechanism-level theories. In particular, we distinguish between conditions that should lead to different behavioral responses to negative feedback: retreat, local search, or distant search. We find support for our theory using data on all U.S. mutual fund companies from 1962 to 2002, and testing both aggregated and mechanism-level theories. Our results show that negative feedback on new funds launched in new domains is particularly damaging to subsequent organizational performance, as firms retreat from the unknown in favor of already exploited domains. In contrast, negative feedback in experienced domains can produce positive outcomes by encouraging action to search for both local solutions to correct the problem and distant solutions to expand the firm’s opportunities. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

While a near future is represented in practical terms and concerned with forming expectations and goals under conditions of uncertainty, a distant future is represented in stylized terms and concerned with imagining possibilities under conditions of ambiguity. Management research on future-oriented action has developed around problems of the near future. To explore distant futures, we analyze the case of geoengineering, a set of planetary-scale technologies that have been proposed as solutions to the threat of climate change. Geoengineering has increasingly been treated as if it were a reality, despite continued controversy and the absence of any implementation. We find that societal-level imaginaries that were built on deeply held moral bases and cosmologies underpinned the conception of geoengineering, and that a dialectic process of discursive attempts to reconcile oppositional imaginaries increased the concreteness and credibility of geoengineering so that it has increasingly been treated as an ""as-if"" reality. We suggest that distant futures orient collective efforts in distinctive ways, not as concrete guides for action but by expressing critiques and alternatives, that can become treated as as-if realities. © 2019 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Drawing on theories of psychological contrast, we hypothesize that high intrinsic motivation in one task reduces performance on less intrinsically motivating tasks. In a field study at a Korean department store, employees with the highest maximum intrinsic motivation in one task had lower average and minimum performance across their other tasks as well as more performance variance across their tasks. In a laboratory experiment in the United States, working on a highly intrinsically motivating initial task led participants to perform worse in a subsequent task if it was uninteresting, but not if it was interesting. This effect was mediated by boredom, but not by a range of other psychological processes. Across both studies, moderate intrinsic motivation in one task was associated with better performance in less interesting tasks than high intrinsic motivation, revealing a curvilinear cross-task effect of intrinsic motivation.

However, existing theories and empirical evidence are contradictory, with the literature containing evidence of positive, negative, and null relationships between negative feedback and recipient creativity. The goal of our research is twofold: first, to organize the contradictory theories under a comprehensive theoretical framework, and, second, to resolve the inconsistency between negative feedback and recipient creativity. Across two studies—a quasi-field experiment and a laboratory experiment—we find that the direction of feedback flow determines the nature of the relationship between negative feedback and recipient creativity, via two distinct mechanisms: task processes and meta-processes. Negative feedback increases recipient creativity in the bottom-up feedback flow (from followers to supervisors), because it heightens the recipients’ focus on task processes, whereby the recipients focus on the generation of better task strategies to close the creativity–standard gap. In contrast, in the top-down (from supervisors to followers) or lateral (between peers) feedback flows, negative feedback heightens the recipients’ focus on meta-processes—a psychological state in which recipients feel threatened by negative feedback—and thus hinders recipient creativity. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

Empirically, we examine the extent to which 65 subsidiaries of a multinational enterprise implemented three corporate social responsibility practices. Adopting a set-theoretic approach, we find that both validity and propriety cues are extremely relevant to the understanding of subunits’ implementation of practices over time. The endorsement of a practice in a subunit’s environment plays a particularly crucial role in the extent to which it is implemented, relative to authorization by the parent firm. Furthermore, subunits strongly rely on the active evaluation of the practice’s propriety, such that the consonance between the two propriety dimensions (strategic importance and value compatibility) is central to implementation increase, while dissonance between them can favor implementation decrease.

We investigate how politicians’ imprinted political ideologies affect the likelihood of firms’ political appointments. Examining 760 city mayors across 242 Chinese cities from 2001 to 2013, we find that cities have fewer private firms appointed to local councils if the mayor—the key decision maker for such appointments—is more strongly imprinted with an orthodox communist ideology that opposes capitalism. The intensity and evolution of such an ideological imprint are influenced by contextual factors. The imprint’s strength is shaped by the mayors’ prior exposure to intense ideological experiences, such as experiencing the Cultural Revolution at a young age. Working in an environment consistent with the ideology (e.g., a province with a greater communist legacy) sustains and even strengthens the imprint, whereas working in an environment inconsistent with the ideology (e.g., a city with greater economic development) attenuates it. We discuss the implications of these findings for political strategy research, imprinting theory, and nascent research on political ideology. © 2019 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

Drawing on an inductive, qualitative analysis of interviews with ARO advocates, as well as textual and visual archival data collected from AROs’ websites, we argue that the suppression of emotion plays a critical role in AROs’ disruptive work. We find that advocates are motivated to suppress their emotions by a perceived incompatibility between their reactive emotional displays and their affective commitment to institutional work, or what we label reactive–affective conflict. We show how two triggers of reactive–affective conflict—potential supporters’ investment in the status quo and emotive norms governing institutional work—encourage ARO advocates to suppress their emotions in face-to-face interactions with audiences while attempting to elicit emotions via visuals as their strategy of disruptive work. We contribute to the literature on the strategic use of emotion in institutional work by highlighting important relationships between the characteristics of potential supporters, the nature of institutional work, and institutional workers’ management of their own emotions to further their institutional projects.

Using interviews with couples from the U.S. Navy, an organizational context that encourages a mix of segmentation and integration behaviors, we develop the construct of relational boundary work to describe the joint behaviors of multiple parties in a relational system to manage the work-home interface. Drawing on family systems theory, we delineate five couple configurations using two dimensions to describe how couples promote togetherness or separateness (cohesion) and how couples balance stability and change in enacting roles (adjustability). Extreme adjustability (very high or very low) is problematic for resilience; this describes both chaotic (low cohesion, high adjustability) and rigid (low cohesion, low adjustability) couples. Extreme cohesion (very high or very low), in contrast, undermines organizational commitment; this describes enmeshed (high cohesion, moderate adjustability), chaotic, and rigid couples. In contrast, balanced couples (moderate cohesion, moderate adjustability) are both resilient and committed in this organization. An examination of relational boundary work reveals that understanding employees' behaviors alone may not illuminate outcomes, and underscores the importance of conceptualizing boundaries as cocreated by employees, outsiders, and organizations within a relational system. © Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

Using two data sets from round-robin surveys of employees in the cosmetic (Study 1) and the financial (Study 2) industries, we show that, while enviers undermine envied targets, they also capitalize on their envy by seeking advice from the envied targets, and enviers who have higher core self-evaluations and friendship with the envied targets are more likely to seek advice from those targets; higher core self-evaluation also decreases the likelihood of undermining the envied targets.

We address this shortcoming while also advancing knowledge on each type of fit. We offer a more nuanced examination of vertical fit (which has typically been assessed with respect to organizations’ broad strategic types) by focusing on the alignment of an HPWS with an organization’s market entry timing mode—a key element of strategy. We propose that among organizations pursuing new product development, the effect of an HPWS on organizational performance is most positive under a fast-follower entry timing, followed by a first-mover and finally a fence-sitter entry timing. We then hypothesize that the benefit of vertical fit is magnified when the complementary human resources practices comprising an HPWS are implemented with greater internal consistency (or with similar intensities) across the ability, motivation, and opportunity domains—reflecting a positive interaction between vertical and horizontal fit in predicting the effectiveness of an HPWS.

We examine this argument by developing an institutional theory of corporate giving and testing our hypotheses using the corporate giving behaviors of publicly listed Korean companies from 2003 to 2011. Consistent with our proposition concerning the role of external audiences in shaping legitimacy management costs, we show that strategic decisions regarding how much a firm spends on corporate giving are related to the extent that the firm receives positive or negative media attention. Furthermore, we find that the relationship between media evaluations and corporate giving varies with a firm’s performance, which suggests that its internal efficiency condition can be an important contingency factor in determining its legitimacy management cost.

Second, scandals pave the way for moralizing discourses and practices, shake taken-for-granted assumptions about the conduct of organizations, and result in a shift in criteria used to evaluate organizations within the field. Our arguments suggest that organizations whose offerings are most similar to those of the implicated organization, yet are perceived as enforcing stricter standards of conduct, are likely to benefit the most from a scandal.

However, agency risk can also create inefficient allocation of resources among innovation activities, on which the literature has provided limited understanding. We examine an important outcome created by agency risk—that agents pursue quantity of innovation at the expense of novelty—and investigate how it is influenced by corporate and public governance. We theorize that improved corporate governance tools, including better alignment of agents’ private incentives and stronger monitoring, and high-quality public governance reduce such agency risk in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Furthermore, higher-quality public governance enhances the functioning of corporate governance tools in further reducing such agency risk in innovation.

"The coercive isomorphism ripple effect: An investigation of nonprofit interlocks on corporate boards","2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059031941&doi=10.5465%2famj.2017.0064&partnerID=40&md5=524c777286fcd34117cfc673b7876535","Institutional theorists have long recognized that board interlocks serve as conduits of information, which can facilitate mimetic isomorphism under conditions of uncertainty. In contrast, the potential for coercive isomorphism—which is a response to direct coercion rather than uncertainty—to spread through board interlocks remains unknown. Drawing on the forced compliance literature from social psychology, we propose that coercive isomorphism exhibits a ripple effect, whereby conforming to coercive pressures leads directors to internalize their acquiescence and apply it to the other boards on which they sit. We test this relationship in the context of nonprofit interlocks on the boards of 209 publicly traded U.S. firms between 2010 and 2014, predicting that coercive pressure to minimize overhead in the nonprofit sphere—a phenomenon known as the nonprofit starvation cycle—spreads to corporate boards through nonprofit interlocks, leading the corporate boards to reduce firm investment in intangible assets. We find that this relationship manifests across our sample, but is strongest via interlocks held by powerful directors and in industries characterized by high investment in intangible assets. Finally, we also find that the coercive isomorphism ripple effect ultimately decreases firm value. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.","",""

Integrating the regulatory loop model of loneliness and the affect theory of social exchange, we develop a model of workplace loneliness. We focus on the central role of affiliation in explaining the loneliness–performance relationship, predicting that despite lonelier employees’ desire to connect with others, being lonelier is associated with lower job performance because of a lack of affiliation at work. Through a time-lagged field study of 672 employees and their 114 supervisors in two organizations, we find support that greater workplace loneliness is related to lower job performance; the mediators of this relationship are lonelier employees’ lower approachability and lesser affective commitment to their organizations. We also examine the moderating roles of the emotional cultures of companionate love and anger, as well as of the loneliness of other coworkers in the work group. Features of this affective affiliative context moderate some of the relationships between loneliness and the mediating variables; we also find support for the full moderated mediation model. This study highlights the importance of recognizing the pernicious power of workplace loneliness over both lonelier employees and their organizations. We offer implications for future research and practice. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We propose a theoretical framework for studying LMX differentiation through an equity-equality perspective derived from allocation preferences theory, allowing us to elucidate both the beneficial and detrimental influences LMX differentiation can have on workgroups. In a meta-analytic investigation including 4,114 workgroups and 21,745 individuals, we found that LMX differentiation was detrimental to collective harmony and solidarity, as indicated by a consistent negative relationship with emergent states and group processes. A theoretical integration of our predictions within an input-mediator-outcome model of group effectiveness revealed a more complex pattern of relationships with group performance. By simultaneously considering the proximal and distal nature of group outcomes, we found that emergent states and group processes not only mediated the negative indirect relationship, but also suppressed the positive direct relationship between LMX differentiation and group performance. These findings demonstrate the utility of an equity-equality framework for understanding LMX differentiation in workgroups and imply that there are tradeoffs associated with differentiation that must be considered when predicting group effectiveness criteria. © Academy of Management Journal 2018.","",""

A common reaction to such unfairness is to talk about it with coworkers. The conventional wisdom is that this unfairness talk should be beneficial to the aggrieved employees. After all, talking provides employees with an opportunity to make sense of the experience and to “let off steam.” We challenge this perspective, drawing on cognitive-motivational-relational theory to develop arguments that unfairness talk leads to emotions that reduce the employee’s ability to move on from the unfairness. We first tested these proposals in a three-wave, two-source field study of bus drivers (Study 1), then replicated our findings in a laboratory study (Study 2). In both studies, we found that unfairness talk was positively related to anger and negatively related to hope.

Addressing climate change will require new sectors that create economically and ecologically sustainable products and services, often supported through voluntary certification standards. For example, the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) voluntary certification standard seeks to reduce the environmental impacts of buildings through stimulating growth of the “green building” sector. Both public and private actors have attempted to promote such standards; however, we know little about the relative efficacy of such efforts. We know even less about how regional culture conditions the impact of such public and private promotion. In this study, we theorize and test how regional institutional logics filter the efficacy of public and private efforts to promote adoption of standards. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to policy, private actors such as social movement organizations, market intermediaries, and environmental entrepreneurs play a role in bolstering adoption. Yet, the efficacy of such interventions is dependent upon variations in regional culture; only environmental entrepreneurs were able to bridge the cultural divide and be equally effective in regions dominated by either market or community logics.

We address this gap by exploring how an individual’s political ideological misfit with an organization’s prevailing ideology impacts departure. By tracking the movements of over 40,000 investment professionals in the U.S. private equity industry over 10 years, we investigate the consequences of the ideological misfit that arises when individuals’ political ideologies diverge substantially from the prevailing ideology of their firms. We hypothesize that ideological misfit increases the likelihood of departure, though the effects vary with liberal or conservative ideological orientation. Polynomial regression analyses reveal that the fit relationship between individual and organizational political ideology deviates from the idealized congruence relationship that underlies prevailing theory. Specifically, we find that departure is more likely for employees experiencing conservative misfit (a personal ideology more conservative than the firm’s) versus liberal misfit (a personal ideology more liberal than the firm’s). Conservatives are more likely to depart than liberals regardless of fit, and departing misfits tend to join new organizations that are closer to their own ideology. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We use extensive archival data to examine how U.S. dietary supplement makers first moved from the drug to the food category in 1976, and, when faced with resistance from the Food and Drug Administration, created an entirely new category in 1994, which then fueled their explosive market growth. Our findings show that regulatory categorization is a contest between firms and the regulator, where firms try to disrupt unfavorable regulation by overpowering the regulator through hard power imposed by other state actors, which is achieved through pressure from another category audience—consumers—who are themselves won over through soft power.

Existing theoretical perspectives on status quo deviations have not sufficiently addressed how managers order the firm's essential activities that differ primarily in terms of the scrutiny those activities engender. Drawing from concepts in the accounting and political science literatures, we advance a “scrutiny-bundling” perspective that suggests that firms engage in scrutiny-hazarding action in the wake of social disapproval, assessed in this study via negative media coverage. We further theorize that a strong linkage between the focus of media coverage and the specific scrutiny-hazarding action exacerbates this relationship. We then contend that managers at firms that are either large in size or that perform well relative to their aspirations are less sensitive to social disapproval, and are therefore less likely to engage in scrutiny bundling.

Using data on inventor mobility and alliance formation among 42 global pharmaceutical firms over 16 years, we show that inventor mobility is positively associated with the likelihood of alliance formation in periods following inventor movements. This relationship becomes more pronounced if mobile employees bring additional knowledge about their prior firm’s technological capabilities and for alliances aimed at technology development rather than for agreements related to technology transfer.

We analyze the Spanish Flu, a contagious disease that was attributed to infected individuals, and compare it with spring frost, which damaged crops and was attributed to nature.

In terms of objective indicators, our results indicate that employees transfer these resources by spending more time in resource-draining activities such as caring for family, and less time in resource-replenishing activities such as socializing and relaxing. This suggests that occupational interactional requirements facilitate a reallocation of time in the home domain.

Given the inherent uncertainty surrounding a decision to invest in these ventures, prior research has found that experienced investors rely heavily on their investor gut feel—that is, dynamic expertise-based emotion-cognitions specific to the entrepreneurship context. In this paper, I inductively find that rather than being based on rapid, nonconscious impulse, as much of prior literature would suggest, what investors call their “gut feel” is an elaborate “intuiting process.” This process serves a distinct purpose: it emboldens investors to make investments that would otherwise be considered overly risky and likely to lead to failure. In the theoretical model I present, I delineate how investors are guided by a predisposed stance on risk and uncertainty, which dictates the approach investors take toward managing the complexity of an investment opportunity—and how they cognitively and emotionally reframe investment risk into a compelling narrative that transcends avoidance behavior and leads investors to invest.

A firm's board of directors has the fiduciary responsibility to select CEOs, but, historically, boards have failed to exercise this authority. Increasing focus on corporate governance has prompted directors to become more engaged in organizational management, but boards face significant barriers to gathering and processing information. However, there is a dearth of research examining how boards overcome informational barriers to enhance decision-making effectiveness. Accordingly, the current study integrates procedural rationality in decision-making with research on boards as information-processing groups to explore how and why boards conduct succession planning processes. Procedural rationality results in formalized processes designed to collect essential information about CEO succession candidates; these processes, in turn, lead to a greater quantity and quality of CEO succession candidates. We also illustrate how CEOs can influence the effectiveness of board information gathering and processing.

With these findings, we contribute to a better understanding of the full spectrum of intentional action in routine dynamics, ranging from purposeful action (foregrounding ends) to purposive action (foregrounding means).

Developing an emergence-based human resource management framework, we propose that an employee-experienced high-involvement work system (HIWS) promotes innovation by eliciting collective interactions for knowledge exchange and aggregation. Further, we investigate the emergence-enabling process that facilitates an employee-experienced HIWS to give rise to organization-level innovation. Specifically, we probe three distinct emergence enablers that amplify the positive influence of HIWS on innovation by shaping the concertedness, direction, and adaptability of collective interactions: (1) the homogeneity of HIWS experiences as the internal mechanism, (2) the strategic importance of innovation as the external mechanism, and (3) the churn in human resources as the temporal mechanism. We tested our theoretical model using data from a nationally representative sample of workplaces in Canada (n 5 2,639). Our results suggest that an employee-experienced HIWS was positively related to innovation. In addition, this positive effect was amplified by all three emergence enablers (i.e., the homogeneity of HIWS experiences, the strategic importance of innovation, and the churn in human resources).

This question is critical to individuals and organizations reaching out to multiple audiences for key resources. While extant work has suggested evaluators are influenced by previous evaluations made by their peers, we develop theory about how evaluators’ assessment of a candidate is shaped by previous evaluations made by an external (nonpeer) audience. We argue that the latter represent exogenous indices that affect evaluators in two opposing ways: they positively influence peer valuation by pointing to candidates’ unobservable abilities, yet, since they are conferred by an external audience, they are also indicative of candidates’ deviation from an expected peer identity. The combination of the two opposite effects suggests an inverted U-shaped relationship between exogenous indices and peer valuation. Further, this effect is moderated by the identity proximity between audiences, and the availability of previous peer evaluations (endogenous indices). We test and find support for our arguments using unique data on the peer valuation of 9,502 academic scientists applying for research grants at a research university. Our work contributes to the understanding of valuation and socially endogenous inferences, and has implications for the management of organizations in multi-audience environments.

More specifically, we examined the effects of situational normality—the degree to which the work setting appears customary, with everything in proper order. We then introduced the construct of situational aesthetics—the degree to which the work setting has a pleasing and attractive appearance. A field study of new accountants revealed that situational normality and situational aesthetics had indirect effects on trust through perceived trustworthiness, with trust going on to predict coworker ratings of learning behavior. We then replicated those trustworthiness findings in a laboratory setting. Taken together, our results suggest that newcomer trust formation may be shaped by aspects of the work setting that have been heretofore ignored by trust scholars.

To advance understanding of this process, I conducted an inductive study of temporary teams in four hospital emergency departments (EDs), and found that the teams in two EDs coordinated effectively, but the teams in the other two EDs did not. To theorize an explanation, I draw on the organizational justice literature and introduce the idea of justice enforceability, defined as the perception that authorities can act fairly, given the potential for other people to cheat. The team members’ perceptions of justice enforceability were focused on whether the distribution of work within and between teams was fair or could be cheated. When team members perceived that justice was enforceable, they were willing to engage in the extrarole behaviors that wove together their individual responsibilities. But when they perceived that cheating was possible, they avoided the extra-role behaviors that would have made them suckers for working hard while others cheated. Justice enforceability thus resolves a common tension in temporary teams, namely that the potential for uneven effort can undermine team coordination. In these ED teams, members only trusted that authorities could act fairly when the distribution of work was exactly equal; then team members felt they were all “in it together,” and each put in the work to coordinate as a team. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""
"Does anger expression help or harm leader effectiveness?

Drawing on emotions as social information theory, we suggest the effects of leaders' expressions of anger depend on both the type of violation about which anger is expressed and the type of leader who expresses it. We test this in a series of studies using experimental and field methods. Study 1 shows that a leader's anger expression in response to followers' integrity-based violations enhances observers' perceptions of leader effectiveness, whereas anger in response to followers' competence-based violations diminishes observers' perceptions of leader effectiveness. Study 2 shows that these divergent effects occur because anger in response to integrity-based violations elicits beneficial inferential reactions among followers who observed the anger, whereas anger in response to competence-based violations provokes harmful affective reactions. Study 3 demonstrates that the negative effects of anger expressed toward competence-based violations are exacerbated, and positive effects of anger expressed toward integrity-based violations weakened, when a leader is perceived as abusive. These findings help reconcile divergent perspectives on the effects of leader anger expression, suggesting that anger can enhance perceived leader effectiveness when expressed in the right situation and by the right person. © Academy of Management Journal 2018.","",""

In doing so, we argue that humor is a key interpersonal resource for leaders and derive our comprehensive model with logic from three individual-resource-related theories-social exchange theory, conservation of resources theory, and broaden-and-build theory. Leader-triggered positive emotion and subsequent social exchange, operationalized as leader-member exchange (LMX), functioned as key sequential mechanisms mediating the relationship between LH and subordinate OCBs. LH induced positive emotion in subordinates, which fostered high-quality LMX and, in turn, OCBs. Contrary to expectations, the stress relief explanation of LH was not supported. This research contributes to knowledge of humor in organizations, and particularly LH, as it is the first to establish a link between LH and OCBs and also represents the first integration and concurrent examination of three functions of humor. We additionally offer empirical contributions to the humor literature by providing a comprehensive test of prior conceptual arguments regarding mechanisms of LH and validating a measure of LH that can be used in future research. For LMX research, we draw attention to LH as an overlooked but important socioemotional resource for social exchange. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Specifically, we theorize that because different infomediaries are situated in different thought worlds, CEOs' use of metaphorical communication has contradictory effects on journalists' and securities analysts' evaluations: while it triggers more favorable statements from journalists, it prompts more unfavorable assessments from analysts. Moreover, we integrate findings from cognitive psychology to argue that these contradictory effects increase the more a firm's performance falls behind market expectations. Our hypotheses find support in an extensive analysis of 937 quarterly earnings calls in the U.S. pharmaceutical, hardware, and software industries, and of journalists' statements and analysts' earnings forecasts and recommendations. Our novel theorizing and findings suggest that the use of discursive frames, especially in the form of metaphorical communication, in firms' interactions with critical audiences creates thought-provoking and thus-far neglected dilemmas. In developing and testing these thoughts, we contribute to and link ongoing conversations in management science, especially discussions of organizational reputation, executive communication, and impression management. © Academy of Management Journal 2018","",""

Yet research has demonstrated that most leaders do not craft visions with image-based rhetoric, instead favoring abstract language that cannot easily be visualized. We integrate theory on leadership and dual cognitive processing to argue that this problem is exacerbated when leaders focus on word selection when crafting visions because they overemphasize the meaning-based cognitive system (in which they consider the abstract meaning of words) and underemphasize the experience-based cognitive system (in which they can generate vivid mental images of what the future could look like). We introduce a novel tactic to help leaders activate the experience-based system and, in turn, generate and communicate more impactful visions. We also investigate boundary conditions.

Engaging in such behavior is called “short selling,” and it has increased considerably among publicly traded North American firms in recent years. This study builds on threat rigidity theory to develop arguments about the behavioral consequences of short sellers. We theorize that, when firms have a high level of short interest, managers adopt a defensive stance by halting new growth initiatives and limiting the range of growth modes in which they participate. We also suggest that managers’ ability to process information and exercise control moderate these main effects. Specifically, we argue that managers will be less reactionary when firms have high absorptive capacity, possess high board centrality, maintain sufficient financial slack, and are well regarded by the media.

Core theories of intergroup conflict suggest that such interteam resource conflicts unite teams internally, reducing intrateam power struggles. However, conflict spillover theory suggests that interteam conflicts may also stimulate competitive power dynamics within teams. We reconcile these two opposing lines of thought by introducing the internal power structure of teams as the key moderator that determines whether interteam conflict reduces or promotes power struggles within teams. We theorize that while the common fate of members of egalitarian teams makes them likely to unite and pool resources when facing an interteam conflict, the power differences in hierarchical teams cause members to be differently impacted by the resource-threatening interteam conflict, leading them to have different perspectives and concerns, thereby promoting internal fights over resources (i.e., power struggles). In turn, such power struggles are expected to negatively affect team performance. We tested these hypotheses with a laboratory study of 85 three-person negotiation teams and a field study of 158 organizational work teams, and found, as expected, that a resource-threatening interteam conflict promotes performance-detracting power struggles in hierarchical (but not egalitarian) teams. © Academy of Management Journal 2018.","",""

Although research has begun to integrate multiple parties into the interrole conflict literature, studies have overlooked how employee interrole conflict and partner interrole conflict can jointly influence employee outcomes. We advance work-family research by integrating balance theory with the interrole conflict literature to investigate dyadic interrole conflict congruence and challenge the implicit assumption that less interrole conflict always results in superior outcomes. Using a polynomial regression analysis of 141 employee and romantic partner dyads, we demonstrate that congruence between couples' experiences of family-to-work (but not work-to-family) conflict is positively associated with balance satisfaction, and ultimately employee job satisfaction and partner relationship satisfaction. Thus, when it comes to balance satisfaction and its downstream correlates, the harmful effects of high family-to-work conflict (FWC) are largely mitigated if an employee's partner shares a similarly high level of FWC, and the beneficial effects of low FWC are largely eliminated if an employee's partner does not share a similarly low level of FWC. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

The behavioral agency model predicts that loss-averse family firms discount their shares more than nonfamily firms to minimize losses of socioemotional wealth (SEW). Conversely, the endowment effect in prospect theory suggests that family owners maximize their financial wealth (FW) by including SEW in perceptions of firm value and demanding a higher IPO price to relinquish it. We reconcile these seemingly incompatible predictions by examining dynamic properties of the reference point in decision framing. Conceiving IPO pricing as a two-stage gamble, we theorize that initial SEW losses entailed by the listing decision increase the disposition of family owners to underprice IPO shares to possibly offset these losses, or “break even.” We thereby advance the behavioral agency model with the aversion to loss realization logic to explain how family owners' decision frames and preferences change during the IPO process, depending on initial losses of current SEW and new expectations of future SEW.

In this article, however, we consider how family may enhance work even when family experiences are not explicitly positive. We draw on boundary theory and cognitive psychology's current concerns theory to evaluate how employees' family structures and associated after-work activities affect their work absorption. A survey of business school alumni (Study 1) revealed that single, childless workers reported lower absorption than workers with other family structures. Further, a daily diary study of university employees (Study 2) showed that employees' planned after-work activities explained the relationship between family structure and work absorption. Specifically, single, childless workers anticipated fewer domestic after-work activities, resulting in lower work absorption. Due to similarities between domestic responsibilities and work tasks-for example, their obligatory and goal-directed nature-anticipating domestic responsibilities after work reinforces, rather than distracts from, the work mindset, thus keeping employees more immersed psychologically in their work. This finding suggests that having a spouse and/or children can affect employees' work absorption positively through the anticipation of domestic duties after work.

We argue that considering advice givers’ brokerage in the team’s advice-giving network (i.e., advice brokerage) may clarify this phenomenon. Specifically, we posit that advice given from a brokerage position contains more nonredundant content that boosts recipients’ creativity. Further, we expect advice brokerage to positively influence a giver’s own creativity, though this effect is at least partially explained via recipients’ proximal creativity gains (e.g., recipients’ creativity change mediates the relationship). Recipients’ perceptions of psychological safety accentuate these relationships. Longitudinal field data support the main hypotheses, but also suggest that advice brokerage has more immediate proximal effects on givers’ creativity; an additional qualitative study elucidates several mechanisms by which brokered advice boosts creativity, including two associated with generating diverse ideas (idea integration, perspective-taking), two associated with domain-specific knowledge accumulation (knowledge accumulation, reflection), collective creativity, and creative feedback.

Through a longitudinal study of photography firms transitioning from analog to digital technologies, we examine a key source of heterogeneity: whether and how incumbents integrate knowledge related to both old and new technologies to bridge generations. Specifically, we explore how the use of three types of intergenerational knowledge bridges—(1) inventor bridges, (2) technology bridges, and (3) hybrid product bridges—influences inventive performance in the new generation. Consistent with theories of inertia, we find that, on average, inventor and technology bridges are associated with lower performance in the new generation. However, the strength of a firm’s inventive performance in the old generation positively moderates this effect. When performance in the old technology is strong, both technology and hybrid product bridges are associated with higher inventive performance in the new generation. This finding suggests that, when combined with a strong R&D program, old-technology knowledge forms a foundation that incumbents can leverage to learn new technologies as they navigate transitions. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

A stock of parent-subsidiary names serves as a lens through which gatekeepers evaluate the parent's underlying creativity at the time of spanning categories. There is expected to be interfirm variance in creativity evaluations due to the differences in the number of autonomous or seeded names a parent sustains, the degree of visibility of different names, and the timing of introducing a new name. Using a panel dataset of global high-end fashion houses between 1998 and 2010, we found that each new autonomous subsidiary name enhanced the parent's creativity appeal up to a certain point (an inverted U-shaped relationship).

As a result of this process, original social movement frames were retained, transformed, or managed through selective referral. We discuss the implications of our findings for research on processes of frame development, social enterprise, and commercialization as a “mobilizing technology” for social movements.

Across two studies—a three-wave field study and an experiment—we find that speaking up promotively, but not prohibitively, is positively and indirectly related to leader emergence via status, and that this relationship is conditional on the gender of the speaker. Specifically, men who spoke up promotively benefited the most in terms of status and leader emergence, not only compared to men who spoke up prohibitively, but also compared to women who spoke up promotively. This research extends our understanding of the outcomes of voice by articulating how it impacts one’s place in his or her group’s social structure, and ultimately whether he or she is seen as a leader. We also add to our understanding of leader emergence by suggesting that talking a lot or participating at a high level in a group may not be enough to emerge as a leader—it also depends how you do it and who you are.

We used a two-phase, qualitative design to allow employees to report how they become aware of and experience misfit, and what they do in response. To address these questions, we conducted interviews with 81 individuals sampled from diverse industries and occupations. Through their descriptions, we identified three broad responses to the experience of misfit: resolution, relief, and resignation. Within these approaches, we identified distinct strategies for responding to misfit. We present a model of how participants used these strategies, often in combination, and develop propositions regarding their effectiveness at reducing strain associated with misfit. These results expand PE fit theory by providing new insight into how individuals experience and react to misfit-portraying them as active, motivated creators of their own fit experience at work. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Defining intra-industry heterogeneity in terms of the technological and customer competences that are required to produce and sell different products in each submarket, this paper explores whether the convergence of these competences, i.e., an increase in the degree to which competences can be leveraged across submarkets, exerts differential effects on the success of industry incumbents versus entrants. Empirical evidence from the global semiconductor manufacturing industry shows that convergence in both technological and customer competences decreases entrants' survival chances, whereas a lack of convergence in any one of the two types of competence-that is, in one set of competences or another but not in both-gives entrants sufficient room to gain a foothold in the industry and to potentially disrupt incumbents. As a strategic response to disruption, multiplant industry incumbents can reposition themselves by changing their focus across submarkets while not necessarily exiting the industry entirely. The paper contributes to the literature on industry evolution, disruption, and competitive dynamics and has implications for future research and practice. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

While current literature assumes these value propositions can be known ex ante and an appropriate ecosystem design derived from them, we focus on generative technological innovations that enable an unbounded range of potential value propositions, hence offering no clear guidance to firms. To illustrate our arguments, we inductively study two organizations, each attempting to create two novel ecosystems around new technological enablers deep in their industry architecture. We highlight how ecosystem creation in such conditions is a systemic process driven by coupled feedback loops, which organizations must try to control dynamically: firms first make the switch to creating the ecosystem, following an external pull to narrow down the range of potential applications; then need to learn to keep up with ecosystem dynamics by roadmapping and preempting, while simultaneously enacting resonance. Dynamic control further entails counteracting the drifting away of the nascent ecosystem from the firm's idea of future value creation and the sliding of its intended control points for value capture. Our findings shed new light on strategy and control in emerging ecosystems, and provide guidance to managers on playing the ecosystem game. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Drawing upon regulatory focus theory, we propose that the gap originates with a gender bias in the questions that investors pose to entrepreneurs. A field study conducted on question-and-answer interactions at TechCrunch Disrupt New York City during 2010 through 2016 reveals that investors tend to ask male entrepreneurs promotion-focused questions and female entrepreneurs prevention-focused questions, and that entrepreneurs tend to respond with matching regulatory focus. This distinction in the regulatory focus of investor questions and entrepreneur responses results in divergent funding outcomes for entrepreneurs whereby those asked promotion-focused questions raise significantly higher amounts of funding than those asked prevention-focused questions. We demonstrate that every additional prevention-focused question significantly hinders the entrepreneur's ability to raise capital, fully mediating gender's effect on funding. By experimentally testing an intervention, we find that entrepreneurs can significantly increase funding for their startups when responding to prevention-focused questions with promotion-focused answers. As we offer evidence regarding tactics that can be employed to diminish the gender disadvantage in funding outcomes, this study has practical as well as theoretical implications for entrepreneurship. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We integrate this theory with social information processing theory to develop hypotheses about the effects of a leader's sense of humor on follower behavior. We suggest that although a leader's sense of humor is positively associated with leader2member exchange and ultimately work engagement, it can also signal to followers the acceptability of norm violation at work. These perceptions in turn are positively associated with followers' deviance. Furthermore, we propose that these indirect effects are moderated by leader aggressive humor.

Thus, feedback-induced change, while likely intended to increase the viability of creative ideas, might paradoxically undermine that viability by compromising creative workers’ associated identity-based relationships with their creative endeavors. While existing scholarship has established the importance of creative revision, research has largely overlooked how this vital process intersects with creative workers’ identities. Through a field study of 59 founders and their entrepreneurial ideas, I present an identity-based process model of creative revision that highlights differences in founders’ psychological ownership of their ideas and how those differences affect subsequent revision efforts. The emerging findings contribute to existing theory by revealing that the capacity to extend the novelty and usefulness of one’s ideas is not merely subject to informational constraints but also to identity-based constraints.

We explore how local organizational agents and contexts enable women leaders to overcome these barriers and achieve success at the highest levels in firms. Specifically, we focus on chief executive officer (CEO) succession events and study how several facets of predecessor CEOs and the succession context combine to influence incoming women's post-succession performance. We conduct a qualitative comparative case study of all CEO successions that involved female successors between 1989 and 2009 across the largest corporations in the United States. Our findings suggest that women's success occurred when a confluence of local firm-level factors and attributes of the (mostly) male predecessors promoted gender-inclusive gatekeeping during succession. Our qualitative comparative analysis approach reveal three recipes for female success: “handing over the legacy,” “partnering the legacy,” and “turning around the legacy.” Moreover, a comparison to a matched-sample of men CEO succession events shows that these three recipes for success are unique to women. Based upon our findings, we propose that male predecessors' gender-inclusive gatekeeping facilitates female leaders' success and occurs when local enabling conditions and the embedded context enact agentic and structural mechanisms to alter leadership schemas. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Our qualitative investigation of the help provided to project teams at a prominent design firm revealed two distinct helping processes, both characterized by deep, sustained engagement that far exceeds the brief interactions described in the helping literature. Such deep help consisted of (1) guiding a team through a difficult juncture by working with its members in several prolonged, tightly clustered sessions, or (2) path clearing by helping a team address a persistent deficit via briefer, intermittent sessions throughout a project's life. We present a model theorizing these processes, which has two noteworthy features. First, it emphasizes the socially constructed nature of helping behavior. That is, the parties must establish and maintain a helping frame for their interaction, especially when help givers are high-status external leaders. Second, the model specifies that the rhythms of deep help-the duration and temporal patterns of giver-receiver interactions-are resource-allocation decisions that also contribute to the social meaning of help. These findings illuminate the theoretical and practical overlap between helping and external leadership in knowledge-intensive project work, and the role of temporality in the helping process. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

This dilemma is especially apparent for Simmelian brokers, who divide time and attention across multiple, otherwise disconnected, friendship cliques. In two samples, we found support for the core idea that the fit between the requirements of the network role and the personality of the individual facilitates trust. Simmelian brokers are trusted by their friends if they exhibit a role-appropriate diplomatic personality style involving flexibility of self-presentation (high self-monitoring) and inhibition of verbal loquaciousness (low blirtatiousness). Of course, not everyone engages in Simmelian brokerage. Some individuals experience a strongly cohesive situation-i.e., a single friendship clique within which they are embedded. For these nonbrokers, we hypothesized and found that the most appropriate trait combination likely to maintain the trust of a group of tightly bound colleagues involved a forthright, be-true-to-yourself, loquacious personality style (i.e., low self-monitoring, high blirtatiousness). In introducing a personality-network fit perspective concerning whether Simmelian brokers are trusted by their colleagues, we help reconcile discrepancies in prior literature concerning whether these brokers are paralyzed into indecision by cross-pressures.

Employing it to enhance team creativity raises an important question of whether positive or negative feedback is more effective. Unfortunately, prior research on feedback valence and creativity is limited to the individual level, neglecting team creativity’s interdependent and knowledge-intensive nature. We address this issue and advance the team-information-processing perspective on team creativity by integrating two heretofore separate research streams to develop a team-specific model about how negative and positive feedback enhance creativity via two alternative information processing routes, contingent on teams’ informational diversity. Negative feedback fuels teams’ systematic effort and attention to external, novel information. In informationally diverse teams, in which members hold different information and perspectives, these efforts promote team creativity through information elaboration. Conversely, positive feedback propels members to flexibly use their information and contribute the resultant divergent insights to the team. In informationally homogeneous teams, wherein these insights relate to others’ information and perspectives, these divergent insights trigger teams’ generative processing and in turn creativity. Results from a team experiment support the predicted feedback valence by informational diversity interaction on team creativity through elaboration and generative processing. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

What makes employee–customer identification different from other forms of identification (e.g., employee–organization and customer–organization identification) is that although the organization may be the conduit for identification to occur, it may not be the focus of identification. Indeed, in the organization we explore here, organizational practices lead employees to identify with customers, but to do so in such a way that employees become—at least in part—more like “who they served” than vice versa. Moreover, the bonds we find between employees and customers are multilayered, incorporating nonwork identities, as well as identities at different levels of inclusiveness (e.g., collective and role).

We argue that the manifestation and influence of the countervailing forces (i.e., synchronization and complacency) on the STTS experience-team effectiveness relationship will depend on salient task characteristics (i.e., frequency and difficulty). More specifically, frequently performed tasks create conditions for complacency to manifest (generating an inverted-U shaped relationship between STTS experience-team efficiency), whereas infrequently performed tasks do not (generating a positive, linear relationship).

In contrast to previous audience-centered explanations, our phenomenological theory emphasizes how brokers construe (i.e., perceive and interpret) their networks. We contend that when women perceive themselves as brokers in friendship networks they experience threat, rooted in negative stereotypes about women brokers, which undermines their performance. Using data from a cohort of MBA students, Study 1 finds that women (but not men) exhibit lower performance when they perceive themselves as brokers in small-group friendship networks. Using data from a larger group of MBA students, Study 2 replicates this finding and rules out the possibility that underlying differences in the propensity to connect those whom one bridges may explain the observed gender-based difference in broker performance. Using an experimental design, Study 3 finds that elevated anxiety about task performance and negative social evaluations mediate the relationship between brokerage and performance for women but not for men.

An effective contract payment structure-a mix of upfront and royalty payments-can help overcome these hurdles. We conduct our research in university technology licensing, where licensing managers act as intermediaries to unite inventors and licensee firms. Rather than leveraging their experience to bargain for maximum payments, highly experienced managers offer contractual payment structures that trade lower upfront payments for higher royalty payments in order to signal value. The signal instills confidence in the value of the partnership for skeptical licensee firms, and experienced licensing managers can amplify signals as needed to overcome the uncertainties inherent in technology commercialization. By explicitly addressing these variations in signal strength, we develop new theory that builds on classical signaling principles.

To explain our findings we introduce the concepts of “position-practices” and position-practice relations (PPR) to theorize how diverse interactions among dispersed actors contribute to service provision continuity in DSS. We develop a conceptual process model which identifies processes of spanning time, and the stretching of space by which the PPR web of service provision is dynamically reconfigured, and identify consequences for both our case as well as other dynamic service settings. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""
"Evenhandedness in resource allocation: ItS relationship with CEO ideology, organizational discretion, and firm performance","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055831464&doi=10.5465%2famj.2016.1155&partnerID=40&md5=58fb1f9980f7d5e3cc92b3537d4b74e0","We develop a new explanation for why some organizations are relatively evenhanded, while others are more disparate, in allocating resources to subunits. Recognizing the central role of chief executive officers (CEOs) in resource allocation, we argue that CEOs’ personal values regarding egalitarianism, as manifested in their political ideologies, will lead to different allocation styles. Liberal CEOs will favor evenhandedness, while conservatives will tolerate greater disparities. Placing this primary expectation in a social context, we then argue that the effects of a CEO’s values are amplified when aligned with the prevailing ideology among organizational members, and conversely are muted when misaligned. Then, examining how instrumental incentives moderate the enactment of CEO values, we envision motivated cognition as a potent psychological process, which leads CEOs to “double down” on their personal values when they have more to gain or lose (when pay is more equity-based or the CEO has larger shareholdings). Finally, we consider the implications of our values-based framework for firm performance, arguing that evenhanded allocations are beneficial when organizational ideology is liberal, but harmful when the organization leans conservative. We test our ideas on a sample of multibusiness firms, using personal political donations to capture ideologies. We find considerable support for our hypotheses.

While these concerns could be examined within each of their own independent literatures, existing theories are ill equipped to handle this process in tandem. Thus, studying these collaborations provides an opportunity to more broadly explore how organizations balance knowledge search or exploration efforts with their needs to manage organizational legitimacy. Accordingly, I suggest that collaboration facilitates access to external information, and that organizations pursue it when the information is needed to solve related problems. However, I also argue that collaborations reciprocally allow stakeholders to more directly scrutinize organizational practices. Thus, I predict that organizations suppress their use of collaborations to solve problems when their legitimacy is potentially or already at risk, such as when powerful stakeholders can hold an organization accountable for inappropriate acts or when some organizational actions have already been deemed as controversial. I test related predictions on the community policing efforts of a law enforcement agency panel, finding general support for several of the study's predictions. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Status inconsistency refers to the extent to which social actors occupy status positions accorded different amounts of social esteem and prestige in different social systems. Status inconsistency affects the performance of multi-unit organizations by weakening the well-established positive effects of status on performance because it creates status ambiguity that makes external evaluations of the organization and its individual units more difficult. Distinguishing between high-status and low-status multi-unit organizations, we argue further that status inconsistency is particularly problematic for high-status multi-unit organizations, whereas low-status multi-unit organizations may actually benefit from status inconsistency. We test our arguments using a longitudinal sample comprised of 109 international business schools and their finance, accounting, marketing, management, and operations departments from 2002 to 2013.

We theorize that factors such as novelty and legitimacy, appropriation, and integration impact the ability of cluster hires to generate economic value. In turn, we hypothesize that the composition of the cluster hire (degree of expertise overlap and degree of comobility) and its fit with the strategic human capital at the hiring firm are likely to influence these factors to affect firm performance. The results from an archival study of cluster hires in 112 domestic U.S. law firms lend credence to the overarching perspective put forth in this paper, and demonstrate that the performance impact of cluster hiring is contingent on its composition and fit with the existing strategic human capital at the hiring firm. Specifically, we find that while the co-mobility dimension has a negative impact on firm performance, the degree of expertise overlap is positively related to firm performance when it adds strategic human capital to an area where the hiring firm has little or no presence. Additionally, we find that expertise overlap positively impacts firm performance when the cluster hire involves low levels of co-mobility. © Academy of Management Journal 2018.","",""

We propose that female leaders are less likely than male leaders to capitalize on these benefits of delegating. Although delegation has communal (e.g., relational) and agentic (e.g., assertive) properties, we argue that female leaders, as compared to male leaders, find it more difficult to delegate tasks due to gender-role incongruence. In five studies, we draw upon social role and backlash theories to show that women imbue delegation with more agentic traits, have more negative associations with delegating, and feel greater guilt about delegating than men. These associations result in women delegating less than men and, when they do delegate, having lower-quality interactions with subordinates. We further show that reframing delegation as communal attenuates women's negative associations with delegation. These findings reveal that even when a given behavior has both agentic and communal elements, perceptions of agency can undermine women's engagement in them. However, emphasizing the communal nature of seemingly agentic acts may encourage women's engagement in such critical leadership behaviors. These findings have theoretical and practical implications for research on gender differences and leadership behavior in the workplace. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

This lessened interpretation results in fewer competitive entries by potential entrants. We used computerized content analysis to quantify the use of vague language in incumbent firms' annual reports and empirically tested our hypotheses through data from the U.S. domestic airline industry.

By publicizing its investments and engaging in institutional activism, a SWF can signal the institutional quality of host countries to internationalizing firms, thus allowing them to overcome the well-known “lemons problem” in international decision-making. We examine the impact of a SWF's signals on firms' ownership choices in their foreign acquisitions. Our empirical analysis of Norway's socially responsible SWF and firms from Norway and Sweden during 1998-2011 shows that firms are more likely to take larger commitments via full equity ownership in acquisitions in host countries where Norway's SWF holds larger investments. The signaling effect of the SWF weakens for conational firms, suggesting that proximity to the signaler may generate alternative information channels that diminish the signaling value of foreign investments. Similarly, institutional harmonization enabled by intergovernmental organizations connecting the home and host countries weakens the signaling value of SWF investments. Our findings point to intermediary signaling by activist institutional investors and the salience of their signals for firms' international decision-making. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

Moreover, models of social support focus on what relationships provide without considering the fit between what people need and receive from their work relationships. Addressing these limitations, we developed and tested a theoretical model of relational attachment at work using a complementary fit perspective. After validating measures, we tested, extended, and replicated our model in three field studies. Results revealed that employees became more attached to their organization and experienced more beneficial outcomes when they had stronger psychological attachment to others at work. This relational attachment was not driven by general social support, but, rather, by “relational needs fit,” which reflects employees’ experience of having their needs met by their work relationships. However, receiving more personal support than what was wanted or needed intruded into employees’ privacy boundaries and created a “too close for comfort” reaction whereby they pulled back from their work relationships. This “too much of a good thing” finding indicates that, while positive relationships at work are effective, social support should be tailored to individuals’ needs.

Drawing upon conservation of resources theory, we develop and test a model that specifies how and when engaging in abusive supervisory behavior has immediate benefits for supervisors. Via two experiments and a multi-wave diary study across 10 consecutive workdays, we found that engaging in abusive supervisory behavior was associated with improved recovery level. Moreover, abusive supervisory behavior had a positive indirect effect on work engagement through recovery level. Interestingly, supplemental analyses suggested that these beneficial effects were short-lived because, over longer periods of time (i.e., one week and beyond), abusive supervisory behavior was negatively related to supervisors’ recovery level and engagement. The strength of these short-lived beneficial effects was also bound by personal and contextual factors. Empathic concern––a personal factor––and job demands––a contextual factor––moderated the observed effects. Specifically, supervisors with high empathic concern or low job demands experienced fewer benefits after engaging in abusive supervisory behavior.

To explore this possibility, we conducted an experimental experience sampling study with a sample of managerial employees whom we surveyed for 10 consecutive workdays. We find that leaders enact more abusive behavior and perceive more incivility from others on days when they are exposed to psychological power compared to days when they are not. Leaders higher in agreeableness are less affected by psychological power.

Based on strategic human resource management research, we introduce contingency theory to examine whether external (industry characteristics) and internal (prior firm performance and collective turnover) environments affect the use of selection practices, how the adoption of selection practices relates to subsequent firm performance, and whether the external (industry) and internal (selection stages and collective turnover) environments moderate the selection-performance relationship. Using a sample of 413 firms, we found that firms use more selection practices when there is less collective turnover and when firms are within low-growth and stable industries. The results also show that firms employing more selection practices generated greater productivity but not profit. Positive effects occur when firms have less collective turnover and are within dynamic industries but, surprisingly, the effects of selection on performance can actually be negative in stable industries.

Higher investments, lower dividend payout, and higher risk tolerance indicate that family firms are better financial stewards of their companies than nonfamily firms. However, family firms are worse organizational stewards than nonfamily firms: they offer lower compensation, invest less in employee training, and exhibit higher voluntary turnover and lower labor productivity. Further, and contrary to earlier research, we find that financial practices in private family firms do not change over time, and that the deleterious influence of family on employment practices rises with both firm age and with heightened family involvement.

Building on the notion that organizational identity acts as a filter through which decision-makers relate to the external environment, I develop the theoretical argument that strong organizational identification increases resistance to environmental pressures due to two mechanisms: (1) it bolsters the decision-maker's certainty and (2) it deflects the decision-maker's attention from the environment. A series of laboratory experiments not only test the mediated relationship between organizational identification and resistance to environmental pressures but also contrast different types of organizational identity. The empirical results support the hypothesized positive link between organizational identification and resistance, which becomes particularly strong when the organizational identity is normative (vs. utilitarian).

"Saving face: How exit in response to negative press and star analyst downgrades reflects reputation maintenance by directors","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049838046&doi=10.5465%2famj.2016.0471&partnerID=40&md5=45e5a7a3fe945e35f0504a8c61300c5b","This paper explores the extrinsic and intrinsic motivations driving individual-level responses to reputational threats in the context of the director labor market. Integrating work on reputation with self-determination and identity theories, we theorize that negative attention from the media and star equity analysts threatens directors' reputations, motivating proactive behavior to mitigate both the external and internal consequences of reputation damage. Using a sample of directors of S&P 1500 firms between 2003 and 2014, we argue and find that negative media coverage and downgrades by star equity analysts are positively related to director exit, even after controlling for firm performance, overall media visibility, and negative events such as lawsuits and financial restatements. We also find that director status intensifies the effect of negative media coverage on exit, serving as the board chair attenuates the effect of star analyst downgrades on exit, and director tenure intensifies the effects of both negative media coverage and star downgrades on exit. In post-hoc testing, we provide further evidence of director reputation maintenance by demonstrating the counterintuitive finding that negative attention from the media and star analysts also increases directors' likelihood of joining the boards of other S&P 1500 firms. © Academy of Management Journal 2018.","",""

Although rarely studied, theory suggests that expression of convergent versus divergent goals and preferences during planning by leadership and component teams matters for multiteam system performance. Addressing this important issue, in a sample of multiteam systems consisting of Air Force officers, we examine how convergent versus divergent preferences for risk expressed during planning by the leadership and component teams impact multiteam system behavior and performance during the performance episode. Drawing from literatures on multiteam systems, diversity, and risk we posit and show that divergent (vs. convergent) preferences for risk have positive implications for multiteam system behavior and performance. Specifically, when the leadership and component teams hold divergent risk preferences, multiteam systems engage in more aspirational behavior and perform better. Alternatively, when the leadership and component teams hold convergent risk preferences, multiteam systems perform worse, partially because they display lower aspirational behavior. Consistent with a learning perspective, the beneficial effects of divergent preferences for risk increase over time. We discuss the implications of our findings for research and practice. © Academy of Management Journal","",""

We join the alliance and agglomeration liter-atures and argue that geographic co-location between a focal firm's partner and rivals introduces potential indirect paths of knowledge leakage to rivals. Geographic co-location creates significant risks of unintentional knowledge spillovers to rivals, while it also increases the likelihood of transactions between the partner firm and the rivals in which firm knowledge can be misappropriated. As a consequence of these risks associated with the co-location of partners and rivals, the focal firm is more likely to employ defense mechanisms when designing alliances. In particular, the focal firm will use equity structures to provide greater monitoring, control, and incentive alignment and will reduce the alliance's scope, as well as task interdependence, to address knowledge leakage concerns. © Academy of Management Journal 2018.","",""

Prior theory suggests that expertise should influence creativity assessments, yet examples abound of experts in different roles disagreeing about whether the same idea is creative. We build and test a social context model of creative idea recognition to show how decision-maker roles can shift creativity assessments. In an experimental study, we show that relative to nondecision- making roles, decision-making roles inculcate an economic mindset and so lead to downgrading otherwise creative ideas with cues of low social approval. A quasiexperimental study triangulates and extends this finding showing that organizational decision-making roles can habitually evoke an economic mindset that shapes creativity assessments. In both studies, decision-maker role, economic mindset, and social approval levels were unrelated to idea usefulness ratings. By integrating work on organizational roles, economic mindsets, and implicit theories of creative ideas, we provide a broadly applicable theoretical framework to describe how social context shapes creativity assessments. This work has important implications for the creativity and innovation literatures, and suggests a new interpretation of the longstanding puzzle of why organizations desire but often reject creative ideas. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We apply principles derived from the literature on attribution of motives to research on relational power to delineate a model that explains employees' moral evaluations of and reactions to referral practices based on the power relationship between a referrer and a hiring manager. Specifically, we predict that employees are more likely to see the acceptance of a referral from a higher- (as opposed to a lower-) power referrer as a way for the hiring manager to gain more power in the relationship with the referrer, thereby attributing more self-interested motives and more counter-organizational motives to the hiring manager in such situations. These motives are then associated with harsher moral judgments of the hiring manager, which in turn lead to less support for the hiring decision. We find support for our model in two experimental studies and two field studies. We discuss implications for the literature on referral practices, ethics, and observers' reactions to power dynamics. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We then theorize balancing operations as coping strategies that the follower can use to address the persistence of abusive supervision over time by changing the power imbalance within the dyad. We hypothesize that through the follower's approach balancing operations, the leader is more likely to regard the abused follower as someone who is instrumental to his or her pursuit of goals and resources, resulting in a reduction in future abuse and an increase in the leader's future reconciliation.

We find employees' perceptions of the change as a phase-shifting event moderates the relationship between overall justice judgments prior to change (time 1), and subsequent assessments of justice six months later (time 2). We study three situational antecedents (i.e., magnitude of change, managerial exemplarity, and coworker support for change) and one individual antecedent (i.e., dispositional resistance to change) of phase-shifting perceptions.

Literature has examined why organizations decouple from regulatory pressures. In this study, we argue that decoupling occurs within regulatory agencies and results from a combination of conflicting institutional pressures, complex goals, and internal fragmentation. Further, regulatory decoupling is selective-that is, regulators fail to adequately enforce standards only for one set of organizations. Regulated organizations that benefit from selective regulatory decoupling use nonmarket strategies to maintain their favorable regulatory status, and, in the process, selectively decouple their norms in one organizational activity but not others. As an empirical context, we use the hospital industry in which regulators have to balance conflicting pressures to be tough on fraud while maintaining the community's access to essential but unprofitable services, such as charity care and medical education. In response, hospital regulators selectively decouple and exhibit leniency in enforcement of mispricing practices toward ""beneficent hospitals,"" defined as hospitals that provide more charity care and medical education. In turn, beneficent hospitals selectively decouple their service and profit goals by providing unprofitable services to uninsured patients, while mispricing insured patients to earn higher reimbursements. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Two field studies (Studies 1 and 3) and two laboratory experiments (Studies 2 and 4) reveal a female premium that is unique to high-potential women (Studies 1 and 2), driven by perceptions that high-potential women have more diversity value than high-potential men (Studies 2 and 4), and larger in contexts where diversity goals are stronger (Studies 3 and 4).

To test our framework, we build a large and unique seven-year panel dataset consisting of data from 245 U.S. communities. We find that increasing the number of welfare nonprofits is beneficial for reducing community inequality, but only up to a point, after which resource competition decreases their effectiveness. This competition for resources is also present when a high density of elite-oriented nonprofits operates in the same community. Hypotheses focused on the institutional dimension receive mixed support. As predicted, welfare nonprofits aremore effective when they operate in communities with strong law enforcement capabilities and less effective in politically conservative local contexts. Contrary to our expectations, however, we find that welfare nonprofits are less effective in demographically heterogeneous local contexts and when the government provides effective social policies, thus indicating a possible substitution effect. Surprisingly, nonprofit effectiveness is increased in highly financialized local contexts.

Specifically, we argue a successful lobbying strategy consists of both the breadth of government targeted and the political connectedness of the firm. Empirical results support our contentions that lobbying breadth and political connectedness affect the benefits firms receive from lobbying, which we operationalize both using government contracts and firm economic performance. Our analyses imply that more is not always better in the case of lobbying breadth, as the benefits accrued via dispersing lobbying across more governmental entities reaches a point of diminishing returns when lobbying breadth reaches high levels.

We argue that focal firm imitation scope and imitation speed drive performance, as well as imitation scope and speed decisions by rivals, which in turn influence focal firm performance. We also argue that the impact of this self-reinforcing Red Queen process on firms' actions and performance is contingent on levels of product technology heterogeneity-defined as the extent to which the industry has multiple designs, resulting in product variety.

Specifically, I consider both the gender of the decision maker and the job of the employee being evaluated. The goal of this study is to determine whether male and female managers differ in how they use the discretion afforded by less formalized pay systems, and to identify the implications for pay among employees at different levels of the organizational hierarchy.

Second, we integrate the values-based cultural distance concept with the norms-based tightness-looseness concept. This allows us to simultaneously account for cultural differences between countries and location-bound normative cultural effects within countries, which cannot be overcome solely through expatriate learning and adaptation. Using a large global dataset of Japanese MNEs, we find support for a convex relationship between cultural distance and the proportion of expatriate parent-country nationals. We also find a moderating (steepening) effect of tightness-looseness on this relationship.

We conduct a longitudinal, inductive study of Ontario's cool-climate wineries and members of six external audience groups who evangelized on behalf of their emerging winemaking practice. We found that wineries drew from three institutionalized vinicultural templates - ""provenance,"" ""hedonic,"" and ""glory"" - to craft rituals designed to convert these audience members. These rituals led to inspiring emotional experiences among audience members with receptive gourmand and regional identities, driving them to engage in evangelistic behaviors. While a growing body of work on evangelists has emphasized their individual characteristics, the role of emotions in driving their activities, as well as how they advocate for organizations, our study demonstrates how evangelism can be built through ritualized interactions with organizations. Specifically, we reveal how organizations develop rituals that translate emerging practices into inspiring emotional experiences for particular members of audiences. This suggests that rituals can be used not only to incite dedication within organizational boundaries, but to inspire members of external audiences to act as social conduits through which emerging practices spread. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Contrary to what we would have believed from the extant literature, we found that themost profound change did not emerge in practices that witnessed the greatest increase in the quantity of resources or in which change agents were given the highest degree of control. Instead, change emerged in a practice that was not treated as a priority and that subsequently attracted interest from a very limited number of individuals. Our findings contribute to the resourcing literature by showing that the ability to use resources is shaped by how they are valued and distributed, and that strategic change initiatives can act as triggers for resource revaluations and redistributions. Specifically, we demonstrate that strategic change initiatives may contribute to the emergence of favorable conditions for change in practices that do not become associated with valued resources. This is because a lack of valued resources attracts limited interest from stakeholders, thereby allowing changes to emerge as powerful agents face minimal coordination costs and scrutiny when attempting to align arrangements with their own interests. Our study thereby shows how and why change initiatives can trigger divergent developments across multiple practices and lead to change emergence in unexpected places.

Drawing on the neo-institutional perspective on professions, we address the question, what role does organizational space play in institutional maintenance? We draw on our ethnographic study to make a threefold contribution. Firstly, our case study shows how spaces, and how institutional actors interacting with them, have a stabilizing effect on the institution, which leads to two important outcomes: maintenance of closure and reproduction of the status order. Secondly, we show how three spatial phenomena underpinning this stabilizing process are intertwined, thus enabling the process of institutional maintenance: (1) emplacement, (2) enactment of space, and (3) enchantment of space. Thirdly, by foregrounding the role of enchantment evoked by organizational spaces, we highlight the importance of the emotional and aesthetic aspects of institutional maintenance.","",""

Classical organization theory prescribes unity of command, achieved by combining the chief executive officer (CEO) and board chair positions; in contrast, agency theory prescribes independent monitoring, achieved by separating the CEO and board chair positions. Extant theory does not acknowledge the possibility that a compromise might exist between these competing theoretical prescriptions, one which might reduce their mutual exclusivity. Such a compromise has emerged in practice, however: the lead independent director. In the present research, we initiate theoretical exploration of this compromise between the prescriptions of agency theory and classical organization theory, addressing the questions of when a board will choose to appoint a lead independent director, who among the independent directors will serve in the position, how lead independent director appointment will impact firm performance, and whether this compromise is a permanent solution or a stepping stone to a more extreme outcome. Analysis of S&P 1500 firms from 2002 to 2012 reveals that lead independent director appointment reflects balanced power on the board, impacts firm performance positively under the right conditions, and generally becomes institutionalized as a permanent governance structure. © Academy of Management Journal 2017.","",""

We used a stereotype threat framework to investigate the impact of threat-inducing (young manager, young workgroup, manual occupation) and threat-inhibiting (high performance practices, mature-age practices) contextual cues on mature-age worker engagement. A total of 666 mature-age employees in Australia described their work experiences in three surveys administered over a threeyear period. Results indicated that mature-age employees who experienced stereotype threat in the workplace reported lower engagement 11-12 months later. All of the contextual cues had an impact on stereotype threat and exerted indirect (mediated by stereotype threat) effects on engagement. However, the effects of manager age were moderated by organizational practices. Diversity conscious mature-age practices moderated the indirect effect of manager age, so mature-age practices were particularly beneficial in counteracting negative cues associated with young managers. But diversity blind high performance practices moderated the direct effect of manager age, so high performance practices were especially helpful in generating engagement among matureage workers with older managers. We recommend that organizations adopt both diversity blind and diversity conscious practices into their diversity management portfolios. The two types of practices are complementary and have additive effects on mature-age worker engagement. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We investigate the speed of opportunity-evaluation decisions by focusing on firms' venture termination and venture advancement decisions. Experience, standard operating procedures, and confidence allow firms to make opportunity-evaluation decisions faster; we propose that a firm's attentional orientation, as reflected in its project portfolio, limits the number of domains in which these speed-enhancing mechanisms can be developed. Hence, firms' decision speed is likely to vary between different types of decisions. Using unique data on 3,269 mineral exploration ventures in the Australian mining industry, we find that firms with a higher degree of attention toward earlier-stage exploration activities are quicker to abandon potential opportunities in early development but slower to do so later, and that such firms are also slower to advance on potential opportunities at all stages compared to firms that focus their attention differently. Market dynamism moderates these relationships, but only with regard to initial evaluation decisions. Our study extends research on decision speed by showing that firms are not necessarily fast or slow regarding all the decisions they make, and by offering an opportunity-evaluation framework that recognizes that decision makers can-in fact, often do-pursue multiple potential opportunities simultaneously. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We test this prediction in four studies. First, using multi-rater evaluations of young managers, we find that self-reliance relates positively to leadership evaluations for women, but not for men. Next, in each of three experiments, we manipulate the gender of a leader and the agentic trait he or she displays (e.g., self-reliance, dominance, no discrete agentic trait). We find that self-reliant female leaders are evaluated as better leaders than self-reliant male leaders are. In contrast, we find a male advantage or no gender advantage for dominant leaders or leaders who are described positively, but not in terms of any discrete agentic trait. Consistent with expectancy violation theory, the female advantage in the relationship between self-reliance and leadership evaluations emerges because self-reliant female leaders are seen as similarly competent, but more communal, than self-reliant male leaders are. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the effects of self-reliance, gender stereotypes, and stereotype violations on leadership evaluations. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We theorize that as job searches progress across time or discrete events, temporal-based pressure increases via perceptions that situations are less changeable or more critical, propelling envious job seekers toward deviant rather than normative search behavior. We propose that market-based pressure, deriving from employment opportunity perceptions, further moderates these effects. In a first study of unemployed job seekers, after more search time passes, job search envy relates to deviant search behavior. Market pressure further qualifies this relationship, although contrary to our prediction, lower market pressure exacerbates rather than attenuates the relationship. Study 2, a two-year study of graduate students engaged in internship and full-time job searches, focuses on event-based temporal pressure and mostly replicates the Study 1 findings. It also indicates that under lower event and market pressures, job seekers expend more effort but do not commit resume fraud in response to job search envy. Overall, we conclude that job search envy transmutes differently depending on temporal-and market-based contingencies and discuss future research possibilities. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Yet, while many studies have examined how microfinance loans affect poor borrowers, we know little about how microfinance organizations (MFOs) themselves finance their lending activities. This is a significant oversight because most MFOs do not self-fund their lending, but, rather, rely on loans from external funders. To better understand microfinance funding, we apply and extend the institutional logics perspective to analyze the lending practices of commercial and public funders, who together provide most of the capital for global microfinance. We argue that these funders adhere to financial and development logics, respectively, and that this leads them to invest in different types of MFOs. Yet, in the face of uncertainty, we suggest that the practices motivated by these logics will start to converge in ways that are problematic for a nation's microfinance sector. Using a proprietary database of all traceable loans to MFOs from 2004 to 2012, we find strong support for our hypotheses. In particular, our findings show that the relationship between institutional logics and organizational practices is contextually contingent, and this insight contributes important understanding about the efficacy of microfinance as a poverty-reduction tool. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We hypothesize and find supporting evidence that such participation increases the likelihood of compliance by positively shaping the firm's view of government legitimacy, but only if the firm views government as responsive to its input. Without this responsiveness, regulatory compliance is even less likely than if the firm did not participate at all.

We advance pliable guidance as a theoretical umbrella to describe how feedback seekers and providers in creative work find a balance between the direction that makes feedback informative and the freedom to explore that infuses new ideas in their work. Our findings show that more curious individuals seek feedback by asking more open questions, which allows them to obtain more feedback.

To make progress, diverse communities often coalesce around an ambitious field goal. However, many field initiatives fall short of their initial objectives. When fields mobilize for a grand challenge, what inhibits them from realizing their intended ambitions? This is a critical question not only for grand challenges, but also for institutional theory, which tends to focus on field mobilization rather than on how goals are pursued over time. Field scholars often assume stable participants with goals that easily translate into actions, but fields are dynamic and unlikely to comply with these assumptions. With a longitudinal, multimethod study of the nanotechnology field, we examined how five communities mobilized and pursued the grand challenge of creating molecular manufacturing from 1986 to 2005. We identify a key duality of mobilization: the very strategies employed to successfully mobilize diverse participants to support the grand challenge actually helped displace it with less ambitious goals. We develop a grounded theoretical model explaining goal displacement in the context of grand challenges, and, in so doing, contribute a dynamic political understanding of field-level strategic action. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

In this manuscript, we extend research on how organizations respond to IDPs in three ways. First, we extend theorizing regarding institutional waves to explain why organizations' rate of change on disclosed metrics are likely to follow a tapering pattern such that improvement occurs most rapidly immediately following the start of an IDP, and then slows with time. Second, we explain why organizations that exhibit the worst initial performance are also likely to exhibit more pronounced tapering in their rates of change. Third, we begin to reconcile competing predictions regarding how organizational size affects organizations' responses to IDPs by theorizing and testing temporal moderation effects between size and (1) rates of initial improvement and (2) extent of tapering. We test our theory using panel data on motor carrier safety obtained fromgovernmental databases following the implementation of a new IDP in 2010.

The current research addresses this important issue from an emotion-associal-information perspective by exploring whether, why, and when leaders' affect influences employees' voice behavior. By collecting data of 640 daily interactions from both sides of 85 leader-employee dyads using the experience sampling method through mobile surveys, we found that leaders' positive affect was positively related to employees' voice behavior. Furthermore, such a relationship could be accounted for through employees' psychological safety directly via the emotional contagion mechanism (through employees' own positive affect) but not directly via the signaling mechanism (through employees' assessment of leaders' positive affect); and the effects of both employees' own positive affect and their assessments of leaders' positive affect on psychological safety were stronger when the leader-member exchange relationship was weak. Interestingly, we also found that leaders' negative affect was positively related to employees' voice, but neither emotional contagion nor signaling mechanisms explained this effect.

Our study shifts attention to the importance of CEO preferences, specifically risk aversion, and suggests an investment theory of strategic reliance on personal relations to achieve organizational goals. To explore the association between CEO risk aversion and reliance on guanxi activities, we combine incentivized behavioral tasks using multiple price list formats for risk elicitation with a manager and firm survey. Our analysis focuses on 345 randomly sampled CEOs of private manufacturing companies in the Yangzi Delta region in China. The results confirm the importance of risk preferences in explaining strategic choices and performance effects: there is a negative association between risk aversion and reliance on guanxi activities, although company age and market orientation moderate the behavioral effect of risk preferences. However, when risk-averse CEOs utilize guanxi, they tend to be more successful, as measured by the firm's financial performance. More generally, our results underscore the importance of personal preferences as determinants of corporate strategy and performance.","",""

We define an illicit role as one whose occupants specialize in activity forbidden by the law, regulatory bodies, or professional societies, in the belief that doing so provides a competitive advantage. Using longitudinal data on professional hockey teams, we examine the enforcer-a player who specializes in the prohibited activity of fighting. We find that team performance is more disrupted by the injury of an enforcer than by the injury of occupants of other formal roles on the team. In addition, team performance recovers more slowly after this setback to the extent the team tries to replace an enforcer, and the performance disruptions associated with his exit are magnified as a function of his experience with his team. We use these findings to develop new theory about organizational roles that operate outside official channels and formal structures. We suggest that such role occupants are more difficult to replace than their formal counterparts, in part because to enact these roles effectively requires experience in the local social context. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

First, through a qualitative field study, we find evidence for three dimensions of voice content: the importance of initiating change, the required resources to enact the desired change, and the interdependencies involved in implementing the desired change. Further, specific targets of identification-either one's local work unit or one's broader profession-shape whether the issues individuals raise take into account barriers related to resources and interdependencies.

However, stakeholder theory leads us to believe that the success of any solution depends on the acceptance and support of important stakeholders.

Our primary argument is that CSR will be most effective at reducing turnover that is motivated by a preference for more meaningfulness at work. We find empirical support for this idea using microdata on attorneys employed by large law firms. We find that firms with higher levels of CSR have moderately lower rates of turnover to startup law firms and turnover through occupation changes, moves which are more likely to be motivated by a preference for meaningfulness than moves to nonstartup law firms. Strikingly, the retention benefits of CSR are much stronger after attorneys experience mortality-related shocks that likely cause them to reevaluate their jobs (i.e., for New York City-born attorneys following the 9/11 terror attacks). To our surprise, we also find that firmswith higher levels of CSR experience higher turnover rates to nonstartup law firms.

While long envisioning how leaders motivate subordinates to stay, management scholars have largely neglected how teams in which leaders belong (e.g., top management teams [TMT]) constitute an organizational context that moderates their ability to retain subordinates. Building on recent theory and research that a leader's humility discourages subordinates from voluntarily departing by increasing their job satisfaction, we propose that faultlines in TMTs can exert cross-level effects attenuating how humble executives sustain MMs' job satisfaction, and how MMs' job dissatisfaction drives their voluntary turnover. We verify these effects with a multisource, multiphase dataset of 43 TMTs, 313 top executives, and 502 MMs. Our study thus bridges the macro and micro divide to offer a multilevel inquiry into contextual influences on voluntary turnover, identifies a boundary condition for leader humility effects, and clarifies how TMT faultlines represent a contextual constraint on how top executives induce MM subordinates to stay. © 2018 IWA Publishing.

Using a dataset of 231 surgical instrument ventures spanning a 25-year period alongside in-depth qualitative fieldwork, we find that professional physician-users (surgeons) strengthen innovation in some roles but block it in others. These experts are related to an increase in a firm's innovation when they take a technology role as inventors, and particularly when they take a governance role on a fledgling firm's board. However, despite their frequent involvement in executive roles, surgeon-executives are less likely to be helpful, and especially likely to block innovation, as chief executives. Our results emphasize expert users as a critical external dependency for a young firm's innovation, but show that expertise can backfire when there is a mismatch with a particular organizational role. A key finding is that expert users are more helpful in suggesting a broad variety of solutions to a firm's innovation problems but less helpful in selecting the best ones for the organization to pursue. Our findings have implications for research on the evolutionary perspective of innovation, user experts and their organizational roles in young firms, and entrepreneurial policy. © Academy of Management Journal 2017.","",""

We test predictions from this framework using meta-analytic techniques on a sample of 146 primary studies conducted in 33 different countries.

While these events bear an intuitive connection to corporate reputation, several scholars have raised questions about the role of discrete exchanges in overall evaluations of firms. Additionally, scholars have neither systematically examined such effects nor elaborated a formal theory thereof. The present paper fills this gap by developing and testing a middle range theory of this important yet poorly understood relationship. This theory identifies the psychological mechanism(trait attribution)which underlies this relationship and explains howdiscrete, stakeholder-specific exchange failures can damage reputations of larger corporate entities. It also explains how social and historical information associated with failed exchanges can affect this process. We elaborate and test this theory through a study of the effects of quarterly earnings misses on firms' standing in the Fortune ""Most Admired Company"" survey. Consistent with our theory, earnings misses did damage firm standing. However, misses did not invariably produce reputational damage and, as predicted, their effects were contingent on associated social (e.g., peer firm reliability, institutional context) and historical (e.g., the firm's track record and statements) information. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We posit that CSR actions focusing on external stakeholders enhance perceived prestige whereas CSR actions focusing on employee welfare enhance perceived respect - both of which are argued to influence employee organizational identification but differentially impact different forms of employee citizenship. These relationships were predicted to vary in strength, however, due to individual differences in social (local vs. cosmopolitan) and cultural (individualist vs. collectivist) orientations.

A qualitative study of fire stations in a major metropolitan area revealed that the emotional cultures of firefighting units were defined by two emotions: joviality and companionate love. In addition, emotion suppression, work-family conflict, risk-taking, and health problems emerged as central themes. A multirater survey study of firefighters across multiple units found that cultures characterized by both high joviality and high companionate love were associated with decreased risk-taking behavior outside of work. Additionally, emotion suppressors who experienced high work-family conflict reported more risk-taking behavior outside of work. Suppressors who experienced higher work-family conflict reported more health problems in strong cultures of joviality, but fewer health problems in strong cultures of companionate love. Longitudinal exploratory analyses of objective performance indicators revealed that, although units characterized by strong joviality had better response times, theywere alsomore likely to have auto accidents and property loss than units weak in joviality, with some evidence that companionate lovemight attenuate risky behavior on the job.

We tested our model in two studies. In Study 1, multisource team data revealed that TMX enhanced member performance when teammates possessed attributes associated with high-quality resources (i.e., high cognitive ability) or when the leader did not. In Study 2, we replicated these findings in a scenario experiment, showing that TMX impacted performance under different resource conditions via felt obligation to utilize teammates' resources.

Researchers may not engage in interdisciplinarity because they would have to invest in new knowledge unrelated to their discipline or risk losing careerrelated rewards. Our field study of a university interdisciplinary research center shows that boundary spanning occurred as students interacted with scientific instruments in a symbiotic relationship through what we call symbiont practices: matching disciplinary language and methods with the experimental possibilities of instruments, developing cospecialization between students and instruments, and engaging disciplinary actors to design experiments using instruments. Instruments engendered incipient interdisciplinary possibilities, but they required the students-engaging in symbiont practices-to actualize that potential. Simultaneously, students required instruments in order to be classified, staffed on projects, and placed in jobs. These practices resolved both the cognitive and economic challenges of boundary spanning by mobilizing material resources that were costly (cognitively and politically) for actors on either side of the disciplinary divide to engage. In conceptualizing interdisciplinary research as occurring through symbiont practices, we develop a sociomaterial perspective on boundary spanning.","",""

While all individuals in our study entered animal shelter work with similar passion and purpose, and faced similar kinds of challenges, those on different paths interpreted challenges differently, had different emotional responses to them, engaged in different kinds of enacted sensemaking, and developed different accounts of themselves and their guiding purpose, through which they interpreted subsequent challenges. The result was the emergence of three increasingly divergent calling paths over time, culminating in different emotional, psychological, and behavioral outcomes.

Leader identity work and leader delegation were identified as themes explaining (1) why higher-status leaders struggled with the new empowering role and (2) how specific leader actions either facilitated or inhibited sharing of tasks and leadership.

We discuss the theoretical and practical significance of considering the temporality of the resourcedepleting effects of surface acting, the role of at-work help giving in buffering the negative effect of emotional labor that could affect the sense of self, and the importance of resource congruence in influencing the efficacy of buffering effects.","",""

In this research, I explore one implication of this shift - how employees respond to client conflicts. In a multi-method qualitative study, I studied patient advocates, hospital employees who mediate conflicts between patients, families, and staff. I develop a process model that shows how mediators construct a web of discrete social interactions that, over time, enables them to develop an empathetic account of the conflict. They then selectively deploy the account to engage in sensegiving. The process model integrates research on emotions and sensemaking in novel ways. I identify how emotion work triggers emotion dynamics in interactions that facilitate or disrupt sensemaking and sensegiving. I show how plausible accounts are developed over the course of social interactions and that mediators pivoted from sensemaking to sensegiving when the account was characterized by empathy. Overall, this research shows how mediators actively generate, interpret, and influence their own and others' emotions, and that mediators' emotion work contributes to the success of collective sensemaking. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We address these gaps by exploring the formation of multiparty venture capital syndicates-a context that exhibits substantial multiparty collaboration but is not often examined through the multiparty lens. We argue and show that multiparty syndication is influenced by a number of group-level constructs.

Survey and diary data collected across multiple time points in a Mexican maquiladora generally support our model. Specifically, we find that family motivation enhances job performance when intrinsic motivation is low - in part by providing energy, but not by reducing stress.

Coordinating requires that interdependent specialists achieve integrating conditions for coordination - including understanding who is accountable for carrying out a given task, how a sequence of actions should proceed, and how one's work fits into the whole on an ongoing basis. Navigating the inevitable disconnect between formal logics of action and the specifics of the local context and situation at hand is a hallmark of effective coordinating. Nevertheless, as work systems designed to direct action with a heavy hand are increasingly implemented in organizations, the disconnect between formal delineations and situated practice is transformed with large negative consequences for organizations. Through 16 months of empirical research using ethnographic methods surrounding implementation of an electronic health records (EHR) system in a hospital obstetric unit, we find that the EHR rendered what was once a productive disconnect between formal logics and situated practice into an unproductive disconnect. Further, this shift engendered a new form of ongoing coordinating. What was once ""artful coordinating"" - in which clinicians across occupations drew upon formal logics, local context, and situated contingencies as resources to action and, in so doing, created conditions of predictability and informal accountability - became ""contorted coordinating,"" characterized by working around formal logics of the EHR while struggling to meet the demands of local context and situated contingencies, thus undermining predictability. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Answering this question is important because prior work shows both that founding team members often have correlated expertise, thus making task position allocation problematic; and initial occupants of task positions exert a lingering effect on venture outcomes. We draw on status characteristics theory to derive predictions on how co-founders' specific expertise cues and diffuse status cues drive initial task position allocation. We also examine the performance consequences ofmismatches between the task position and position occupant.Qualitative fieldwork, combinedwith a quasi-experimental simulation game and an experiment, provides causal tests of the conceptual framework. We find that co-founders whose diffuse status cues of gender (male), ethnicity (white), or achievement (occupational prestige or academic honors) indicated general ability were typical occupants of higher-ranked positions, such as chief executive officer role, within the founding team. In addition, specific expertise cues that indicated relevant ability predicted task position allocation. Founding teams created more financially valuable ventures when task position occupants' diffuse status cues were typical for the position; nonetheless position occupants with high diffuse status cues also appropriated more of the created value.

Combining evidence from an experimental and a survey study, this paper puts forward and tests two interrelated propositions: (1) employees' team and organizational commitment interact to influence employees' preference for different interteam conflict handling strategies; (2) a high commitment to one entity can lead to the adoption of dysfunctional conflict handling strategies with negative outcomes for the organization unless accompanied by a high commitment to the other entity. To test these propositions, we conducted an experiment (N 5 179) to assess participants' reactions to eight reality-based conflict scenarios in which their team's interests collided with those of other teams within the same organization. For each scenario, the conflict description was manipulated with regard to the strength of participants' team and organizational commitment (high vs. low), resulting in an 8 3 2 3 2 factorial design. As expected, results show that high levels of commitment to one entity but not the other involve specific risks for the organization, thus supporting a dual commitment model.

This can happen within multiplex relationships, especially when they involve firms that have both business and personal interactions between their key decision makers. We combine insights from the literatures on status, multiplex relationships, and competitive positioning to examine how actors' behaviors in a business domain of a multiplex relationship are shaped by the deference norms in a personal domain of the same relationship.We argue that marriages between owner-families of Korean business groups cause deferential behaviors between these families as a function of gender-based status differences within kinship ties.

This zero-sum construal of success in turn makes employees less inclined to help. Four studies found evidence consistent with our theory. Study 1 found that worse economic periods are associated with a more zero-sum construal of success, using data from 59,694 respondents surveyed across 51 countries and 17 years and objective indicators of their macroeconomic environments. Studies 2 and 3 experimentally induced the perception that the U.S. economy was performing poorly with a sample of U.S. employees and found that this perception led employees to have a more zero-sum construal of success and made them less inclined to help.

Companies have primarily focused their employee training programs on two dimensions of display: intensity and authenticity. Yet there is limited research on when, how, and why these two dimensions affect customer reactions. Drawing on the emotions as social information (EASI) framework (Van Kleef, 2009), we develop a conceptual model in which display intensity and display authenticity differentially influence customer loyalty by changing customers' affective reactions and cognitive appraisals. Further, we propose that the relative impact of either dimension depends on customers' motivation to understand the environment deeply and accurately (i.e., their epistemic motivation). We tested our model in one field study and one laboratory study. Results across these two studies provide consistent support for the proposed model and advance our understanding about how different dimensions of employees' positive affective displays enhance customer reactions. Thus, findings of this research contribute to knowledge on the interpersonal effects of emotions in customer-employee interactions. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

By conducting a qualitative study of emergency-department physicians and their interactions with other hospital specialists, we show how specialists maintain professional values through two distinct processes of institutional work in which moral emotions-that is, emotions linked to the interests of others-play a key role. The first process is activated when a perceived episodic problem, which arises from value conflicts in interactions between different specialists, elicits transitory moral emotions that motivate institutional maintenance work through individual action. The second process is activated when a perceived systemic problem, which arises from conflict between professional values writ large and organizational practices, elicits moral emotions that are enduring and shared across specialists. These emotions mobilize collective action in institutional maintenance work that changes the organizational practice. By focusing on values as a source of conflict and a motive for professional action inside organizations, our model contributes a nuanced understanding to the everyday work of professionals and specialists and draws attention to emotion elicitors and emotional scope as affective mechanisms in processes of institutional work. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

The first is that, in order to believe in the business case, executives need factual evidence that this business case indeed exists. The second premise is that those executives who do believe in the business case will readily invest in CSR-related activities. The results from our four studies tell a different story. We show that managers, rather than focusing on factual evidence, believe in the business case because they espouse a fair market ideology-the tendency to justify and idealize the market economy system. At the same time, even though managers espousing a fair market ideology believe in the business case for CSR, they are not more inclined to engage in CSR than managers who do not hold such an ideology, because they also experience weaker moral emotions when confronted with ethical problems. By drawing on system justification theory, we simultaneously explore antecedents and consequences of executives' belief in the business case for CSR and of their moral emotions. In doing so, we help advance knowledge about the micro-foundations of CSR.","",""

We find that audiences stigmatize an organization because they fear that it threatens a particular moral order, which leads them to mount sustained attacks designed to weaken or eradicate the organization. Our model suggests that an organization that experiences this form of profound disapproval can nonetheless purge its stigma and become legitimate through a two-step process: first the organization engages in stigma reduction work designed to minimize overt hostility among audiences by showing that it does not pose a risk to them. Second it engages in stigma elimination work designed to gain support from stigmatizers by showing that it plays a positive role in society. Our study therefore reorients organizational stigma research from a focus on how organizations can cope with the effects of stigma, and considers instead how they can eradicate the stigma altogether. We also shed light on much neglected audiencelevel dynamics by examining the process through which audiences construct stigma and why these constructions may change. © Academy of Management Journal 2017.","",""

We develop the nascent theory on sponsorship by highlighting the dual and contingent nature of the relationship between public sponsorship and market performance. By arguing that sponsorship differentially affects resource accumulation and allocation mechanisms, we suggest two opposing firm-level effects, leading to an inverted U-shaped relationship between the amount of public sponsorship received and the market performance of sponsored organizations. This nonlinear relationship, we argue, is moderated by the breadth, depth, and focus of the focal organization's resource accumulation and allocation patterns. While horizontal scope (i.e., increased breadth) and an externally oriented resource profile (i.e., reduced depth) strengthen the relationship, market orientation (i.e., increased focus) attenuates it. We test and find strong support for our hypotheses using population data on French film production firms from 1998 to 2008.

Recent work, however, has suggested that employees often engage in OCBs not because they want to but because they feel they have to, and it is not clear whether OCBs performed for external motives have the same positive effects on individuals and organizational functioning as do traditional OCBs. In this article, we draw from selfdetermination and moral licensing theories to suggest a potential negative consequence of OCB. Specifically, we argue that when employees feel compelled to engage in OCB by external forces, they will subsequently feel psychologically entitled for having gone above and beyond the call of duty. Furthermore, these feelings of entitlement can act as moral credentials that psychologically free employees to engage in both interpersonal and organizational deviance. Data from two multisource field studies and an online experiment provide support for these hypotheses. In addition, we demonstrate that OCB-generated feelings of entitlement transcend organizational boundaries and lead to deviance outside of the organization. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Organizations commonly set targets - explicit and quantitative reference points - for their operational units that reflect top management aspirations for these units. Targets are commonly the outcome of a subjective process where supervisors combine their explicit and tacit knowledge to set performance expectations for their units. Using a proprietary database from a large European travel company during a period of rapid expansion, we document the effect of organizational learning by studying how targets change as units mature. In particular, we examine managers' experiential learning from branches' past performance and their vicarious learning from branches in the same region in determining performance expectations over the life cycle of branches. Our results indicate that, in setting performance targets, managers increase the weight of a branch's past performance and decrease the weight of comparable branches' performance as the branch matures. Vicarious learning, where managers extrapolate the performance of comparable branches to a new branch, dominates in the early years. Over time, this type of learning is replaced by experiential learning as experience accumulates. We document how early on in the life of branches, these two types of learning interact; this interaction disappears as branches mature. Furthermore, we find that managers learn differently from successes and failures early in the lives of the new units, and this learning is affected by the magnitude of the successes and failures. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Our findings suggest a recursive model of new logic construction in which council members mobilize three emotional facilitators (social emotions, moral emotions, and emotional energy) to affect three logic-construction cycles (agreeing on values, shared learning, and enacting shared values). Emotional facilitators work through three agentic mechanisms: enabling actors to become open and reflexive about their home logics and simultaneously increase their commitment to and engagement in constructing a shared governance logic. Ongoing interactions involving emotional facilitators, agentic mechanisms, and logicconstruction cycles are essential in sustaining the new logic. The processmodel foregrounds the role of emotions in enabling dually embedded agency, thereby extending extant theory that has tended to focus narrowly on cognitive dynamics.

Our theoretical argument suggests that in anticipation of social interaction with a relatively high-status colleague, corporate directors tend to reflect on characteristics shared with that colleague, while avoiding thoughts about characteristics not shared. We explain how this pattern of cognition induces genuine positive feelings and admiration for the colleague, such that their interpersonal behaviors are less likely to appear as insincere attempts to curry favor, and thus more likely to engender influence. We further suggest that this pattern of cognition is especially valuable when interacting with relatively high-status colleagues who are demographically dissimilar from the focal actor. Finally, our theoretical framework indicates how this self-regulated cognition facilitates advancement in the corporate elite by positively moderating the effects of one's interpersonal behavior on the likelihood that colleagues will recommend him or her for a board appointment.

While multidisciplinary teams are critical for knowledge creation in increasingly specialized work environments, the coordination literature has been divided with respect to the extent to which such teams rely on formal coordination structures and informal coordination practices. Our findings show that when interdependencies among knowledge domains are dynamic and unpredictable, specialists design self-managed (sub-)teams around collectively held assumptions about interdependencies based on incomplete information (conjectural interdependencies). These team structures establish the grounds for informal coordination practices that enable specialists to both manage known interdependencies and reveal new interdependencies. Newly revealed interdependencies among knowledge domains, in turn, promote structural adaptation. Drawing on these findings, we advance an integrative model explaining how team-based knowledge creation relies on the mutual constitution of formal coordination structures and informal coordination practices.

We make such a theoretical contribution within the domain of strategic alliances by investigating the effects of previous alliance agreements, or prior ties, between the partnering firms.

We introduce impression offsetting, an anticipatory impression management technique organizational leaders employ when they expect a focal event will negatively violate the expectations of external stakeholders. Accordingly, in these situations, organizational leaders will announce the focal event contemporaneously with positive, but unrelated information. We predict impression offsetting will generally occur in the context of acquisitions, but also more frequently for specific acquiring firms and acquisitions that are more likely to lead to an expectancy violation. We also posit that offsetting will effectively inhibit observers' perceptions of events as negative expectancy violations by positively influencing shareholder reactions to acquisition announcements. Consistent with our hypotheses, in a sample of publicly traded acquisition targets, we find evidence for impression offsetting, in which characteristics of both acquirers and their announced acquisitions predict its frequency of use. We also find evidence that impression offsetting is efficacious; on average, it reduces the negative market reaction to acquisition announcements by over 40%, which translates into approximately $246 million in market capitalization. © 2016 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Employing a field experiment using newly hired employees in a large IT firm that prioritizes selftranscendent values, this study explores how narratives that vary in terms of the organizational level of main characters and the values-upholding or values-violating behaviors of those characters influence newcomers' tendencies to engage in behaviors that uphold or deviate from the values. The results indicate that stories about low-level organizational characters engaging in values-upholding behaviors are more positively associated with self-Transcendent, helping behaviors, and negatively associated with deviant behaviors, than are similar stories about high-level members of the organization. Stories in which high-level members of the organization violate values are more strongly negatively related to newcomers' engagement in both helping and deviance than are values-violating stories about lower-level members.

Yet research has overlooked how temporality, as a negotiated organizing of time, shapes institutional processes, despite the fact that timing, duration, and tenor of relationships are their foundational elements. To unpack the role of temporality in institutions, we examine how actors engage in temporal institutional work-that is, how they construct, navigate, and capitalize on timing norms in their attempts to change institutions. We draw on an inductive study of an institutional project to establish a novel foundation-based university that subsequently came to pace major statewide university reform. We identify three forms of temporal institutional work: entraining-as a top-down, routinized, reproductive form-and constructing urgency, and enacting momentum-both as bottom-up, issuedriven and generative forms. We show that by engaging in these types of work, actors produce windows of opportunity, synchronicity, and irreversibility as shared beliefs of temporality. These beliefs, in turn, shape how the wider institutional change unfolds. Our study shows that temporal institutional work enables institutional change.We discuss the implications for reconceptualizing institutional research from a temporal perspective. © 2016 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

However, a recent meta-analysis found that psychological empowerment relationships vary significantly across studies, and there is still a rather limited understanding of how empowerment operates across levels. Accordingly, we advance and test a multi-level model of empowerment which seeks to better understand the unique and synergistic effects between unit and individual empowerment in hospital units. Analysis of data involving 544 individuals in 78 units, collected from multiple sources over three different time periods, revealed that unit empowerment evidenced a synergistic interaction with individual-level psychological empowerment as related to individuals' job performance, as well as an indirect effect on performance via individual empowerment, while controlling for previous performance levels. Notably, these effects were significant at relatively high, but not at relatively low, levels of unit empowerment.

The current study elaborated on theory pertaining to within-episode emotional labor dynamics, utilizing a call center simulation to examine how shifts in customer incivility impacted on continuous measures (captured every 200 milliseconds) of participants' felt emotions, surface acting, deep acting, and vocal tone during a single interaction. Results provided evidence that customer behavior causally influences within-episode changes in emotions, emotion regulation, and vocal tone, and that these key emotional labor variables significantly relate to each other at the momentary level of analysis.

Our empirical analysis of 46 firms from 1978 to 1997, operating within the U.S. medical device and pharmaceutical sectors, demonstrates that while decision makers initiate structural recombination during periods of industry growth (i.e., munificence), they reduce their recombination efforts during periods of industry turbulence (i.e., dynamism), and managerial turbulence (i.e., growth in top management team size). We also find evidence that firms delay realignment and bide their time for better environmental conditions of declining turbulence and industry growth before pursuing more structural realignment. Together, these findings suggest that decision makers often delay initiating structural recombination until they can effectively process information and assess how structural changes will help them realign the organization to the environment. © 2016 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Do colleagues award volunteering ""credit"" (e.g., associating it with being concerned about others) or do they ""stigmatize"" it (e.g., associating it with being distracted from work)? Moreover, do those evaluations predict how colleagues actually treat employees who volunteer more often? Adopting a reputation perspective, we draw from theories of person perception and attribution to explore these research questions. The results of a field study reveal that colleagues gave credit to employee volunteering when they attributed it to intrinsic reasons and stigmatized employee volunteering when they attributed it to impression management reasons. Ultimately, through the awarded credits, volunteering was rewarded by supervisors (with the allocation of more resources) and coworkers (with the provision of more helping behavior) when it was attributed to intrinsic motives-a relationship that was amplified when stigmas were low and mitigated when stigmas were high.

To secure investment, entrepreneurs can signal about their venture's latent potential by aligning themselves with reliable third parties. Such affiliations affirm the new venture's legitimacy and provide substantive benefits in the form of mentoring, access to resources, and ongoing monitoring. However, early stage financing is an especially ""noisy"" signaling environment owing to the large number of startups seeking funding, many of which will not survive. The real value of third-party affiliations in this context resides in their ability to unlock the potential of other more pedestrian signals, such as the entrepreneur's characteristics and actions that might otherwise go unnoticed. We borrow from the sensemaking literature to explain how third-party affiliation signals disambiguate signals with multiple possible interpretations so that potential investors interpret them positively.

Integrating an institutional perspective with signaling theory, our core argument is that offline seller characteristics that are visible online\-in particular, geographic location and legal status\-convey credible signals of seller behavior because they provide buyers with information on sellers' local institutional quality and the institutionally induced obligations and controls acting on sellers. Using unique data from a large, Italian, online B2B marketplace between the fourth quarter of 1999 and July 2001, we find that both sellers' local institutional quality and their legal statuses affect a buyer's likelihood of contacting a seller. Moreover, consistent with the idea that a buyer's own local institutional quality generates a relevant reference point against which sellers are evaluated, we find that a buyer is progressively more likely to contact sellers the higher their local institutional quality relative to the buyer. Jointly, our findings imply that, in online B2B marketplaces, signals conveyed by sellers' geographic locations and legal statuses may constitute substantive sources of competitive heterogeneity and market segmentation. © 2016 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

In a polynomial regression analysis of 280 leader-subordinate dyads, employee work engagement-and subsequent organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)-was maximized (at each level of LMX quality) when leaders and subordinates were in agreement about the quality of their LMX relationship, but suffered when they did not see ""eye to eye."" Indeed, situations in which both leaders and subordinates evaluated their relationship as low quality were associated with higher work engagement (and subsequent OCB) than were situations of disagreement in which a single member evaluated the relationship as high quality.

In this study, I adapt these theories to posit that organizations establish close collaborative relationships with regulatory agents to overcome uncertainty following enforcement actions, and I ascertain that such collaborations can enhance organizational compliance with enforced mandates. However, I also find that organizations with the least visible practices will go ""under the radar,"" foregoing such collaborations because of the risks associated with disclosing private information to regulators.

Using insights from organizational behavior research, we argue that horizontal coordination between component teams can benefit if a multiteam system is composed of generalist members who are acquainted with the multiple functions present in the overall system (i.e., high intrapersonal functional diversity [IFD]). At the same time, however, such IFD may have detrimental side effects because generalists' broad focus may distract them from high-impact, specialized activities (i.e., aspirational behavior). Building on insights from organization theory, we propose that coordination across a multiteam system's hierarchical layers (i.e., vertical coordinated action between a team tasked with system-wide integration and task-specialized component teams) is critical for reaping IFD's benefits while avoiding its costs. These notions are supported in a sample of 236 14-person multiteam systems engaged in a realistic decision-making simulation.

Extending recent work that has emphasized the presence of multiple audiences with different concerns, we demonstrate that considering audience specificity leads to an improved understanding of reputation effects. Using data on emerging artists in the field of contemporary art from 2001 to 2010, we investigate the manner in which artists' audience-specific reputations affect their subsequent success with two distinct audiences: museums and galleries. Our findings suggest that audience-specific reputations have systematically different effects with respect to success with museums and galleries. Our findings also illuminate the extent to which audience-specific reputations are relevant for emerging research on the contingent effects of reputation. In particular, our findings support our predictions that audiences differ from one another in terms of the extent to which other signals (specifically, status and interaction with other audiences) enhance or reduce the value of audience-specific reputations. Our study thus advances theory by providing empirical evidence for the value of incorporating audience-specific reputations into the general study of reputation. © 2016 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Utilizing an experience sampling methodology through which 82 employees were surveyed for 10 workdays, we find that daily OCB is associated with positive affect, but it also interferes with perceptions of work goal progress.

Although current research has explained the phenomenon using several different theoretical perspectives, prior studies have not explicitly tested the theorized mechanisms. This paper develops and tests a model that incorporates three theories of trickle-down effects for interactional justice perceptions: social exchange theory, social learning theory, and displaced aggression. Using crosssectional data from 200 supervisor-subordinate dyads in Study 1 and longitudinal data from 270 supervisor-subordinate dyads in Study 2, we test this multiple mediator model. The results demonstrate that the two aspects of interactional justice perceptions- interpersonal and informational justice perceptions-trickle down fromsupervisors to subordinates through two different mechanisms. Specifically, displaced aggression accounts for the trickle-down effects of interpersonal justice perceptions and social exchange accounts for the trickle-down effects of informational justice perceptions.

However, there remains considerable debate about whether and when hierarchy can promote group performance and member satisfaction. We suggest that progress in this debate has been hampered by a lack of clarity about hierarchy and how to conceptualize it. Whereas prevailing conceptualizations of hierarchy in the group and organization literature have focused on inequality in member power or status (i.e., centralization or steepness), we build on the ethological and social network traditions to advance a view of hierarchy as cascading relations of dyadic influence (i.e., acyclicity). We suggest that hierarchy thus conceptualized is more likely to capture the functional benefits of hierarchy, whereas hierarchy as inequality is more likely to be dysfunctional. In a study of 75 teams drawn from a range of industries, we show that whereas acyclicity in influence relations reduces conflict and thereby enhances both group performance and member satisfaction, centralization and steepness have negative effects on conflict, performance, and satisfaction, particularly in groups that perform complex tasks. The theory and results of this study can help to clarify and advance research on the functions and dysfunctions of hierarchy in task groups. © 2016 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We address this question by unbundling the effects of uncertainty in foreign ventures at the venture and country levels. We contend that, while both levels increase the need for partnering with local firms in foreign ventures, country-level uncertainty increases the difficulty of partnering with local firms and decreases the likelihood of such partnerships. We also posit that experiential learning helps firms manage the two types of uncertainty, and thereby reduces the need for partnering-yet, experience in the host country makes partnering more feasible and increases the likelihood of such partnerships. To test our hypotheses, we conceptualize the decision to partner with a local firm in a foreign venture as a multilayered decision, and model it accordingly.

Our two-study examination of a cross-domain antecedent of abusive supervision stands in contrast to prior research, which has focused primarily on work-related factors that influence abusive supervision. Further, our investigation shows how ego depletion is proximally related to abusive supervision. In the first study, conducted at a Fortune 500 company and designed as a lagged survey study, we found that, after controlling for alternative theoretical mechanisms, supervisors who experienced FWC displayed more abusive behaviors toward subordinates, and that this relationship was stronger for female supervisors and for supervisors who operated in environments with greater situation control. These resultswere then replicated and expanded in an experience sampling study using a multi-organization sample of supervisors. This allowed us to study the FWC-abusive supervision relationship as it emerged on a day-To-day basis and to examine ego depletion as an explanatory mechanism. Consistent with our hypotheses, we found that FWC was associated with abusive supervision, ego depletion acted as a mediator of the FWC-abusive supervision relationship, and that gender and situation control served as moderators. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Studies have examined the consequences this has for individuals, but have largely overlooked how organizations that address such issues are affected. To understand this, we apply and extend the institutional logics perspective. Our approach recognizes that practices within different sectors of a society may be shaped by different organizing principles. However, we suggest practices are also likely to reflect-to varying degrees-broader societal logics. Based on this, we argue that societal logics may work through multiple influence channels and affect organizations in non-obvious ways, depending on how, where, and with what intensity they manifest in society. We test our theory by analyzing how patriarchy, as a societal-level logic, affects outreach to women by microfinance organizations in 115 nations. We find that patriarchy supports practices in the family, religion, professions, and state that suppress this outreach. Yet, in some nations, patriarchy is differently evident across sectors. The resulting contrasts draw attention to women's issues, motivate redress efforts, and catalyze resource flows to microfinance organizations. The greatest outreach to women is in these nations. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

By incorporating community attributes to account for organizations' heterogeneous responses to institutional pressure, the study advances current institutional scholarship and demonstrates empirically how such a theory can help explain the success of relatively weak organizational actors' resistance in the face of strong institutional pressures by the state-that is, as a result of their embeddedness in a community. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Under uncertainty, acolytes (i.e., subordinates with work connections to high-reputation industry leaders) are likely to benefit in terms of signaling fitness for promotion in the external job market. Analysis of promotion outcomes of coaches in the National Football League over 31 years showed that the acolyte effect was reduced for individuals for whom uncertainty was lowest (acolytes with considerable industry experience or high centrality in the co-worker industry network). There was no support for either a knowledge-transfer or an intrinsic-quality explanation for why acolytes initially gained advantage. Rather, evidence supported the idea that ties to high-reputation leaders were somewhat randomly distributed so that acolytes faced ex post settling-up consequences after their promotions: i.e., fewer further promotions or lateralmoves, andmore demotions. Thus, acolytes initially benefited from loose linkages between their unobservable quality and signals offered by their industry-leader ties, but also suffered as the unreliability of social network signals became evident.

Four experiments showed that individuals with a creative identity reported higher psychological entitlement and engaged in more unethical behaviors. Additionally, when participants believed that their creativity was rare rather than common, they were more likely to lie for money. Moreover, manipulation of the rarity of creative identity, but not of practical identity, increased psychological entitlement and unethical acts. We tested for the mediating effect of psychological entitlement on dishonesty using both measurement of mediation and experimental causal chain approaches.

However, there is a paradox inherent in the social imprinting of WISEs: Although social imprinting directly enhances a WISE's social performance, social imprinting also indirectly weakens social performance by negatively affecting economic productivity. Results based on panel data of French WISEs gathered between 2003 and 2007 are congruent with our predictions. To understand how socially imprinted WISEs may mitigate this negative relationship between social imprinting and economic productivity, we also conduct a comparative analysis of case studies.

To reduce this conflict, individuals strengthen their identification with the new organization and deidentify with the former by competing harder against the former organization.

However, upon considering how justice behaviors influence subordinates' cognitive processes, we predict that interpersonal justice has a surprising, unintended negative consequence. Supervisors who violate interpersonal justice rules trigger subordinates to search for reasons why their supervisors are threatening them, causing subordinates to be more attuned to supervisors' individual characteristics and therefore unlikely to use stereotypes when evaluating them. In contrast, supervisors who adhere to interpersonal justice rules allow subordinates to divert attention away from them, leading subordinates' judgments of their supervisors to be influenced by stereotypes. Consistent with these predictions, using field data we found that minority supervisors faced bias relative to Caucasian supervisors when supervisors adhered to-but not when they violated-interpersonal justice rules. We replicated this effect in an experiment and established that it is explained by an alternating pattern of stereotype application and inhibition: the stereotype that minority supervisors are more deceitful than Caucasians influenced fairness judgments when supervisors adhered to-but not when they violated-interpersonal justice rules. We then conducted exploratory analyses and identified one factor (unit size) that mitigates this troubling pattern. © 2016 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

In this study, we begin to unpack the micro-foundations of firm-specific human capital by theoretically and empirically exploring when employees perceive their skills to be firm-specific.We first develop theoretical arguments and hypotheses based on the extant strategy literature, which implicitly assumes information efficiency and unbiased perceptions of firmspecificity. We then relax these assumptions and develop alternative hypotheses rooted in the cognitive psychology literature, which highlights biases in human judgment. We test our hypotheses using two data sources from Korea and the United States. Surprisingly, our results support the hypotheses based on cognitive bias-a stark contrast to expectations embedded within the strategy literature. Specifically, we find organizational commitment and, to some extent, tenure are negatively related to employee perceptions of the firm-specificity. We also find that employer-provided onthe- job training is unrelated to perceived firm-specificity. These results suggest that firm-specific human capital, as perceived by employees, may drive behavior in ways unanticipated by existing theory-for example, with respect to investments in skills or turnover decisions. This, in turn, may challenge the assumed relationship between firm-specific human capital and sustained competitive advantage. More broadly, our findings may suggest a need to reconsider other theories, such as transaction cost economics, that draw heavily on firm-specificity and implicitly assume widely shared and unbiased perceptions. © 2016 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Drawing on previous work across multiple disciplines and proposing a framework that extends human resource management theory more explicitly and rigorously to the context of emerging economy manufacturing, I theorize and demonstrate that the voluntary adoption of a labor code can constitute an effective human resource investment in emerging economies in improving establishment-level employee outcomes and operational and financial performance.

Policies and practices conceived in high-income countries for improving the lives of patients in low-income countries have been criticized as ineffective or harmful. We examine the impact of one such policy, the World Trade Organization's 1994 Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which was partly justified by a claim that patents and other intellectual property protections would improve the availability of drugs for ""neglected diseases"" such as malaria and tuberculosis. There is little evidence associating TRIPS with clinical trials, patents, or trade-in drugs for these diseases. One explanation for this is that basic science is required as a prerequisite to drug development. We theorize, test for, and find evidence that TRIPS encouraged the time-consuming and complex development of managerial institutions required for basic science on neglected diseases. The results indicate an increase in basic science on neglected diseases and in applied science on nonneglected diseases as countries became TRIPS compliant. In newly TRIPS-compliant, low-income countries, scientists intensified basic research on locally relevant diseases.

The model also explores how charismatic leaders influence such appraisal and reaction processes, and, by virtue of these effects, how leaders can influence the impact of stressful demands on their followers' job performance. In Study 1 (n = 74 U.S. Marines), our model was largely supported in hierarchical linear modeling analyses. Marines whose leaders were judged by superiors to exhibit charismatic leader behaviors appraised challenge stressors as being more challenging, and were more likely to respond to this appraisal with higher performance. Although charismatic leader behaviors did not influence how hindrance stressors were appraised, they negated the strong negative effect of hindrance appraisals on job performance. In Study 2 (n = 270 U.S. Marines), charismatic leader behaviors were measured through the eyes of the focal Marines, and the interactions found in Study 1 were replicated. Results from multilevel structural equation modeling analyses also indicate that charismatic leader behaviors moderate both the mediating role of challenge appraisals in transmitting the effect of challenge stressors to job performance and the mediating role of hindrance appraisals in transmitting the effect of hindrance stressors to job performance.

We analyze the conditions under which knowledge that is useful for carrying out a key value chain activity is inherited, and explore the mechanism through which such an inheritance shapes an entrant's strategies and, in the process, influences its performance. Evidence from the early U.S. auto industry indicates that employee spinoffs generated from incumbents that had integrated a key value chain activity were also more likely to integrate that activity than other entrants, which, we suggest, reflects the application of knowledge inheritance relative to that activity. Moreover, we find that the integration of this key activity, stimulated by knowledge inheritance, contributed to the establishment of defensible strategic positioning, thereby enhancing the survival duration of inheriting spinoffs. We thus link together the phenomena of knowledge inheritance, vertical integration, and strategic positioning to explain entrant performance. Previously, these three phenomena have tended to be treated disparately in the literature, rather than in combination. © 2016 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

With few exceptions, this literature has focused exclusively on capital market participants (e.g., investors, securities analysts) as the arbiters of a firm's legitimacy and has accordingly assumed that legitimate governance arrangements are those derived from the shareholder-oriented prescriptions of agency theory. We extend this line of research in new ways by arguing that customers also externally assess firm legitimacy, and that firms potentially adjust their governance characteristics to meet customers' norms and expectations. We argue that the cultural-cognitive institutions prevalent in customers' home countries influence their judgments regarding a firm's legitimacy, such that firms competing heavily in highpower distance cultures are more likely to have powerful CEOs, with CEO power a source of legitimacy-rather than illegitimacy-among customers. We also argue that the more dependent a firm is on its customers and the more salient cultural power distance is as a demand-side institutional norm, the greater this relationship will be.

Specifically, we develop theory to explain how and when stock analysts and peer executives applied reputational penalties tomanagers when firms used a poison pill, a prominent anti-Takeover device. We find that the reputational penalties associated with poison pills differed substantially between these two groups and that these groups applied different penalties depending on the media coverage that the poison pill received, the performance of the firm, and the extent to which the practice had already been adopted.

Phase 1 (disruption) is marked by a sudden and negative change in unit-level performance, while Phase 2 (recovery) entails a gradual increase in unit performance over time. We further propose that the positional distribution (manager or employee) of the turnover event and the amount of interdependence within the collective will influence the consequences of a turnover event. Using a sample of 524 branches of a U.S. bank, the results largely support the hypotheses as a turnover event leads to an immediate and negative change in branch-level performance. Notably, there is an interaction between manager and employee turnover events that significantly decreases performance. In the recovery period, branches recover more quickly after losing an employee than they do after losing a manager. However, the moderating effect of branch-level interdependence depends on the position, and there is no statistically significant recovery from a manager turnover event within our performance window.

This literature suggests that organizations are more likely to undertake major changes when their performance declines below aspirations or targets for acceptable performance, but few studies examine how multiple groups of organizational decision makers, each with potentially conflicting interests, might collectively influence this process. To that end, I incorporate theory regarding corporate boards and their role in organizational decision making. I use this integration to suggest that boards with particular characteristics may have interests that do not align with those of the management team when performance shortfalls occur, using their influence to force compromises or compel managers to reconsider particular changes. I find support for the related predictions that an increase in board size and equity ownership suppresses change when performance drops, although I find no support for similar arguments regarding board turnover.

Empirical evidence from a meta-analysis based on 108 primary studies from 42 countries supports our hypotheses. We further argue and empirically show that the observed effects are even stronger when the CEO of the family firm is a later-generation family member. However, when the CEO of the family firm is the firm's founder, innovation input is higher and, contrary to our initial expectations, innovation output is lower than that in other firms.

Through an inductive study of the wind energy field in Colorado, we find that logic hybridization resulted when social movement organizations (SMOs), electric utility firms, hybrid organizations, and policy makers variously responded to incompatibility between economizing and ecologizing logics. After compromise with electric utilities and efforts to justify wind power in economic terms failed to reduce the dominance of the economizing logic, SMOs switched tactics to promote the ecologizing logic. Once SMOs succeeded in altering the balance of power in the field, hybrid organizations then emerged to legitimize a new set of frames, practices, and arrangements that integrated the previously incompatible logics. Electric utility firms and policy makers then formalized and embedded the new hybridized logic in the field. Our findings suggest that the hybridization of field-level logics is a complex process in which organizational actions and field-level conditions recursively influence each other over time.

Findings demonstrate that role transitions are not only influenced by a few key contacts but that the entire (extant) network of professional relationships shapes the way people reconfigure their workplace relations during a role transition. © 2016 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

This paper looks at the battles between entrepreneurs and market incumbents in a regulatedmarket where various institutional actors (e.g., regulators, courts) have the power to protect the incumbents by hindering the entrepreneurs. Our comparison of one failed and one successful attempt to introduce pay TV in theU.S. reveals howentrepreneurs can first enter a regulated market without facing resistance, and then introduce a new frame to legitimize their product or service despite growing resistance from incumbents. Our framework highlights framing as a strategy and framing contests as a mechanism through which entrepreneurs and incumbents can battle to enable or disable institutional change. As part of this process, we also uncover howentrepreneurs evolve fromself-serving actors with no field-level intentions to powerful groups that create a ripple effect in their environment by moving their target of influence from private to institutional actors.

Although this construct has received far less attention than trusting, the consensus is that believing their supervisors trust them has benefits for employees' job performance. Our study challenges that consensus by arguing that feeling trusted can be exhausting for employees. Drawing on Stevan Hobfoll's conservation of resources theory, we develop a model in which feeling trusted fills an employee with pride-a benefit for exhaustion and performance-while also increasing perceived workload and concerns about reputation maintenance-burdens for exhaustion and performance. We test our model in a field study using a sample of public transit bus drivers in London, England. Our results suggest that feeling trusted is a double-edged sword for job performance, bringing with it both benefits and burdens. Given that recommendations for managers generally encourage placing trust in employees, these results have important practical implications. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We develop and test a theoretical model, positing that, when leaders behave humbly, followers emulate their humble behaviors, creating a shared interpersonal team process (collective humility). This, in turn, creates a team emergent state focused on progressively striving toward achieving the team's highest potential (collective promotion focus), which ultimately enhances team performance. We test our model across three studies wherein we manipulate leader humility to test the social contagion hypothesis (Study 1), examine the impact of humility on team processes and performance in a longitudinal team simulation (Study 2), and test the full model in a multistage field study in a health services context (Study 3). Our findings collectively support our theoretical model, demonstrating that leader behavior can spread via social contagion to followers, producing an emergent state that ultimately affects team performance. We contribute to the leadership literature by suggesting the need for leaders to lead by example and showing how a specific set of leader behaviors influence team performance, providing a template for future leadership research on a wide variety of leader behaviors. © 2016 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Our empirical analysis of voluntary patent expirations (i.e., patents that firms give up by not paying renewal fees) in 97 pharmaceutical firms between 1980 and 2002 shows that the number, importance, and timing of small failures are associated with a decrease in R&D output (patent count) but an increase in the quality of the R&D output (forward citations to patents).

These debates point to the psychological cost of war as a grand challenge whose scale and complexity stretch far beyond the already large and growing number of veterans affected. We use a unique ethnography of a military medical team's tour of duty in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, to explore the role of institutional context as a contributing factor to psychological injury from war. We find that exposure to war and its consequences invokes sustained experiences of senselessness, futility, and surreality that are partially rooted in cultural expectations, professional role identity, and organizational protocol, and can threaten people's existential grounding in this institutional context. We argue that what makes work at war traumatic for some and not others is likely affected by the specific context through which people filter, frame, and cope with their experience.

We argue that under conditions of significant decision uncertainty, a higher proportion of domain experts on a board may detract from effective decision making and thus increase the probability of organizational failure. Building on exploratory interviews with board members and CEOs, we derive hypotheses from this argument in the context of local banks in the United States. We predict that the greater the level of decision uncertainty-due to rapid asset growth or operation in less predictable markets-the stronger the relationship between the proportion of banking expert directors and the probability of bank failure. Longitudinal analyses of 1,307 banks between 1996 and 2012 support this prediction, even after accounting for both the overall level of professional diversity among directors and banks' different propensities to have an expert-heavy board. We discuss implications for the key dimensions of board composition, the conditions under which the professional background of directors is more or less consequential, and the mechanisms whereby board composition affects organizational outcomes. © 2016 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

While the presence of dual directors is positively associated with the average stock market returns of parent and spinoff firms, their presence is also increasingly positively associated with parent firm performance, but increasingly negatively associated with spinoff firm performance as the share of sales a spinoff firm makes to its parent firm rises. These findings show that, while dual directors give a parent firm power over its spinoff firm, dual directors only exercise that power at the spinoff firm's expense when that company is highly dependent on its parent firm. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

In contrast, we draw on bounded rationality to theorize about how in information-sparse environments, individuals may misperceive the quality indicated by a firm's objective track record.We argue that accurate evaluations depend not only on individuals' motivation and ability to access information but on the convergence of these factors with attributes of the potential partner being evaluated.

However, investors are likely to perceive and evaluateM&As holistically\-that is, as complex configurations (i.e., gestalts) of characteristics, rather than as a list of independent factors. And, yet, extant M&A literature has not addressed why and how configurations of factors elicit positive or negative reactions. Overlooking the interdependent nature of factors known to influence acquisition success has limited our understanding of both M&As and investor judgment. Taking an inductive approach to addressing this important issue, the present study relies on fuzzy set methodology. Our results provide compelling evidence that investor perceptions ofM&A announcements are not only configurational in nature but also characterized by equifinality (or the presence of multiple paths to success) and asymmetric causality (i.e., configurations that represent bad deals are not simply a mirror image of good deals, but differ fundamentally). By constructing a typology of ""good"" and ""bad"" deals as perceived by market participants, we develop a mid-range theory of M&A stock market performance.

We build theory about unearned status gain drawing from a qualitative study of 90 U.S.-based employees of a Japanese organization following a company-wide English language mandate. These native English-speaking employees believed that the mandate elevated their worth in the organization, a status gain they attributed to chance, hence deeming it unearned. They also reported a heightened sense of belonging, optimism about career advancement, and access to expanded networks. Yet, among those who interacted regularly with Japanese counterparts, narratives also revealed discomfort, which was manifested in at least two ways. These informants engaged in ""status rationalization,"" emphasizing the benefits that Japanese employees might obtain by learning English, and prevaricated on whether the change was temporary or durable, a process we call ""status stability appraisal."" The fact that these narrativeswere present only among those working closely with Japanese employees highlights intergroup contact as a factor in shaping the unearned status gain experience. Supplemental analysis of data gathered from 66 Japanese employees of the organization provided the broader organizational context and the nonnative speakers' perspective of the language shift. This study's findings expand our overall understanding of status dynamics in organizations, and showhow status gains can yield both positive and negative outcomes. © 2016 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Extant theory posits that, due to information asymmetry, stakeholders struggle to comprehend the actual change in firms' practices. In contrast, we advance a cognitive-linguistic perspective to explain why stakeholders are sometimes misled. Accordingly, we propose that firms' deception does not appear in the content of their communication, but in its linguistic properties, which derive from how managers cognitively construe the sustainability challenge. Thus, firms cover the same points of content in their reports, but firms that practice what they preach use more complex styles of language than do firms that decouple their action from their statements. Moreover, we theorize that generalist stakeholders and stakeholders with conflicts of interest are unable to detect these linguistic nuances, whereas specialist stakeholders can. We find evidence for this cognitive-linguistic perspective in a textual analysis of grammatical structure in 261 interviews conducted in a large field study of 12 multinational corporations and their stakeholders.

Specifically, women are attributed with higher levels of leadership emergence than men when they engage in agentic leadership behaviors-even if the level of the behaviors exhibited by men is exactly the same.

However, this negative competitive interdependence is attenuated in local communities where: (1) corporations represent a potential threat to the autonomy of local farmers, (2) there is a generally anti-corporate climate, and (3) there is a well-established organizational infrastructure supporting a cooperative ideology. Consistent with sociological theories that emphasize the mobilizing force of ideology, these local conditions spur and facilitate collective action among farmers to establish cooperatives in response to the local diffusion of corporations. We show further that the diffusion of plants owned by big business (oil and agribusiness) in communities characterized by a general anticorporate climate especially promotes greater ideological contestation and the mobilization of resources to form cooperatives. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Testing the model using a sample of 358 workers from 25 organizations, we found support for our hypotheses that leader-member exchange (LMX) and affect-based trust in peers each partially mediated the interactive effects of own and peer abusive supervision. Workers that exhibited high levels of task performance and engaged in more helping behaviors tended to have both low own abusive supervision and low peer abusive supervision. Own abusive supervision was unrelated to the behavioral outcomes among workers whose peers were victims of supervisory abuse. We discuss the implications of relational dynamics with peers and the immediate supervisor for understanding the scope of the impact of abusive supervision on follower outcomes.

Prior research has largely focused on the benefits of network ties, documenting the many advantages that accrue to firms embedded in a rich network of interorganizational relationships. In contrast, we build on research emphasizing potential drawbacks to examine how competitive exposure, enabled by powerful intermediaries, can inhibit innovation. We develop the concept of ""competitive information leakage,"" which occurs when firms are indirectly tied to their competitors via shared intermediary organizations. To test our theory, we examine every relationship between entrepreneurial firms and their venture capital investors in the minimally invasive surgical device segment of the medical device industry over a 22-year period. We find that indirect ties to competitors impede innovation, and that this effect is moderated by several factors related to the intermediary's opportunities and motivation to leak important information. © 2015 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Alternatively, attributional theories of leadership suggest that evaluations depend on knowledge of past organizational performance, which is attributed to the leader's skills. We develop a novel theory showing how inferential and attributional processes simultaneously explain top-level leader evaluation, and, ultimately, leader retention and selection. We argue that observers will mostly rely on attributional mechanisms when performance signals clearly indicate good or poor performance outcomes. However, under conditions of attributional ambiguity (i.e., when performance signals are unclear), observers will mostly rely on inferential processes. In Study 1, we tested our theory in an unconventional context - U.S. presidential elections - and found that the two processes, due to the leader's charisma and country's economic performance, interact in predicting whether a leader is selected. Using a business context and an experimental design, in Study 2, we showed that CEO charisma and firm performance interact in predicting leader retention, confirming the results we found in Study 1. Thus, our results suggest that this phenomenon is quite general and can apply to various performance domains. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We study firms' management of radical technological change by separating their actions into upstream research (the ""R"" of R&D) and downstream development (the ""D"" of R&D). We introduce two contingencies to explain when incumbents' research investments in radical technologies translate into product development and when these upstream investments may get voided by organizational inertia downstream. First, radical technologies can differ in how they conform to incumbents' existing business models, impacting the extent to which the movement of research outputs toward development will be subject to inertial pressures. Second, incumbents can invest in a radical technology through a variety of modes (internal research, external research contracts, alliances, acquisitions). These modes represent unique combinations of who does research and who is involved in the decision for subsequent development, and, hence, differ in the extent to which they are shielded from inertial pressures. This difference helps explain why incumbents, despite responding to radical technologies, may still be unable to adapt, as well as what types of investments will be more effective in helping firms navigate technological change. Evidence from pharmaceutical incumbents' pursuit of monoclonal antibodies and gene therapy offers strong support for our arguments. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Recent theorizing in strategic management research suggests that there may be important firm-level outcomes influenced by the regulatory focus of top executives. We expand research on regulatory focus theory by testing whether chief executive officers' (CEOs') regulatory focus impacts the proclivity of firms to undertake acquisitions. Furthermore, regulatory focus theory suggests that the effects of people's promotion and prevention foci are magnified when their regulatory focus is congruent with salient situational characteristics, a phenomenon known as regulatory fit. As a test of this idea, we demonstrate how the effects of CEO promotion and prevention foci are differentially impacted by one such characteristic, namely incentive compensation.

One way they do so is by expanding or contracting their conception of organizational identity. In studying these processes, we develop the construct of ""identity elasticity"" - the tensions that simultaneously stretch, while holding together, social constructions of identity. To explicate the parameters of elasticity, we problematize previous conceptions of the three foundations of organizational identity - centrality, endurance, and distinctiveness - and document the dialectic tensions experienced in their social constructions. We show how identity is experienced not only through a listing of attributes but also by negotiating a set of processual tensions. In so doing, we also bring together two competing views on organizational identity - process and characteristic. We show how experiencing and navigating the tensions of elasticity is a type of organizational identity work (process) that changes organizational members' constructions of identity (characteristic).

Our emergent findings reframe current theorizing on feedback by revealing its interactive nature: feedback providers and creative workers co-construct a problem space that provides openings for changing prototypes. Our analysis revealed sets of moves that feedback providers (personalizing, puzzling, measuring, and prescribing) and creative workers (backgrounding, forecasting, and opening) use to interact.

Above this threshold, increased participative leadership is related to higher employee performance. Building on adaptive resonance theory (Grossberg, 1999), a variant of implicit leadership theory, we further hypothesize that leaders' information-sharing behavior will moderate this curvilinear relationship. We test this model using two independent samples: office and call-center employees (Study 1) and factory workers (Study 2). Results from Study 1 reveal that this curvilinear relationship is stronger when leaders' information sharing is high and weaker when information sharing is low.

Building on prior work in competitive dynamics from the Austrian School perspective, we propose that imitation can be an effective means of staying ahead, even in the absence of mimetic social pressures. This is because the leader's imitation of follower actions represents equilibrating moves to maintain the status quo in reaction to the disequilibrating actions that the follower undertakes to catch up with the leader. Furthermore, reduction of difference in competitive positioning between leader and follower serves the same purpose, and both imitation strategies are complementary. These effects of ""action imitation"" and ""positioning imitation,"" we argue, are moderated by the degree of environmental uncertainty, by the extent of the leader's initial advantage, and by the difference between leader and follower capabilities. Our theoretical arguments are supported by an analysis of data on head-to-head boat races from the America's Cup World Series.

However, from a sensemaking perspective, newcomers may also draw insight from stakeholder behavior in order to better understand how to best meet job-related objectives and expectations. These understandings may manifest as performance-related motives, leading to the adoption of risky behaviors that can be detrimental to newcomer health and organizational effectiveness. Using multisource, multilevel, and longitudinal data, we demonstrate that the alcohol use norms of both organizational veterans and clients are significantly associated with the performance drinking motives of newcomers in sales and client service teams, suggesting that veteran and client norms signal to newcomers that drinking alcohol is an effective and legitimate means to improve job performance. In addition, we demonstrate that performance drinking motives mediate the positive relationship between veteran and client alcohol use norms and newcomers' frequency of work-based heavy drinking.

Second, we integrate these mechanisms in a theoretical model that explains how individuals can continually keep coexisting logics, and their tendencies to either blend or disconnect, in a state of dynamic tension that renders them conflicting-yet-complementary logics.

Soliciting suggestions is a form of distant search, since it allows organizations to tap into knowledge that may not reside within their organizational boundaries. Organizations engaging in distant search often face a large pool of suggestions, an outcome we refer to as crowding. When crowding occurs, organizations, given a limited attention span, can attend to only a subset of suggestions. Our core argument is that crowding narrows the attention of organizations; that is, despite organizations' efforts to reach out to external contributors and access suggestions that capture distant knowledge, they are more likely to pay attention to suggestions that are familiar, not distant. We test our theory with a unique longitudinal dataset that captures how 922 organizations responded to 105,127 crowdsourced suggestions from external contributors. After distinguishing between three different dimensions of distance (content, structural, and personal), we find that (a) all three types of distance have independent negative effects on the likelihood of attention, (b) crowding amplifies these negative effects, and (c) there are differences among the effects' magnitudes. We elaborate on the broader implications of these findings for the literatures on attention, search, and crowdsourcing. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Furthermore, we propose that the extent to which these different mechanisms are prevalent in a team has implications for the team's research productivity, with deference based on social affinity detracting from it and deference based on task contributions enhancing it. Using longitudinal data from a sample of 55 multidisciplinary research teams comprising 619 scientists, we found general support for our conceptual model.

One concept - situation strength - was hypothesized to predict the validities of all of the ""Big Five"" traits, while the effects of the other - trait activation - were hypothesized to be specific to each trait. Based on this interactionist model, personality-performance correlations were located in the literature, and occupationally homogeneous jobs were coded according to their theoretically relevant contextual properties. Results revealed that all five traits were more predictive of performance for jobs in which the process by which the work was done represented weak situations (e.g., work was unstructured, employee had discretion to make decisions). Many of the traits also predicted performance in job contexts that activated specific traits (e.g., extraversion better predicted performance in jobs requiring social skills, agreeableness was less positively related to performance in competitive contexts, openness was more strongly related to performance in jobs with strong innovation/ creativity requirements). Overall, the study's findings supported our interactionist model in which the situation exerts both general and specific effects on the degree to which personality predicts job performance. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We propose that engagement can be considered an organization-level construct influenced by motivationally focused organizational practices that represent firm-level resources. Specifically, we evaluate three distinct organizational practices as resources-motivating work design, human resource management practices, and CEO transformational leadership-that can facilitate perceptions that members of the organization are as a whole physically, cognitively, and emotionally invested at work. Our theory is grounded in the notion that, when used jointly, these organizational resources maximize each of the three underlying psychological conditions necessary for full engagement; namely, psychological meaningfulness, safety, and availability. The resource management model also underscores the value of top management team members implementing and monitoring progress on the firm's strategy as a means to enhance the effects of organizational resources on collective organizational engagement. We empirically test this theory in a sample of 83 firms, and provide evidence that collective organizational engagement mediates the relationship between the three organizational resources and firm performance. Furthermore, we find that strategic implementation positively moderates the relationship between the three organizational resources and collective organizational engagement.

Relaxing this assumption results in a more realistic notion of team cognition in which the distribution of metaknowledge can take different forms. Demonstrating the importance of this conceptual shift, we compare teams in which metaknowledge is concentrated within one central member (a centralized TMS structure) with teams in which metaknowledge is distributed evenly among the members (a decentralized TMS structure). We predict that centralized metaknowledge can give teams a performance advantage over decentralized metaknowledge, because centralized metaknowledge can allow the central member to function as a catalyst for information exchange and integration. We propose this catalyst effect to be contingent on the extent to which the distribution of task information among members poses high coordination demands to effectively integrate mmbers' knowledge. In a laboratory team decision-making experiment (n=112), we found the predicted interaction effect between TMS structure and the distribution of task information.

Studying a context in which work was highly interdependent and helping was pervasive, however, we propose that this emphasis on the initial point of consent is incomplete. Instead, we find that workplace help-seeking and help-giving can be intertwined behaviors enacted through an organizational routine. Our research, therefore, shifts the theoretical emphasis from one of exchange and cost to one of joint engagement. More specifically, we move beyond the initial point of consent to recast help-seeking and help-giving as an interdependent process in which both the help-seeker and the help-giver use cognitive and emotional moves to engage others and thereby propel a helping routine forward. In contrast to the existing literature, an organizational routines perspective also reveals that helping need not be limited to dyads, and that the helping routine is shaped by the work context in which help is sought. Finally, we extend these insights to the literatures on routines and coordination and debate how our results might generalize even if helping is not part of an organizational routine. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

This approach is notable because it suggests that different organizations with similar experiences may have quite distinct reactions based on where that experience originates. Specifically, I predict that organizations learn less effectively when their failures are relatively concentrated in origin, meaning that failures typically involve a particular unit or even a specific individual, compared to when failures are more broadly dispersed.

We experimentally manipulated institutional complexity and gauged the time to compliance of 100 childcare managers in the Netherlands, and then asked them to describe and explain their anticipated responses to multiple pressures. We found that institutional complexity leads decision makers to delay compliance, but usually not passively: decision makers used the time before compliance to attempt to reduce institutional complexity by neutralizing opposing pressures, challenging the coercive pressure, adapting the practice to suit opponents and their own personal beliefs, and/or waiting to see how the situation would unfold as multiple parties influenced one another. We found two factors influenced decision makers' choice of responses: (1) their interpretation of institutional complexity and (2) their personal beliefs toward the practice itself.

We also hypothesize that the magnitude of the punishment will be moderated by intermediaries' assessments of the input: Ex ante regulatory sanctions on the input will amplify negative spillovers, while the presence of input-level associations will weaken these effects. Finally, we predict that similarity between the responsible and nonresponsible firm in terms of two peripheral attributes- input portfolio and geographic location-will amplify the negative effect of input usage.

Using theories of market signaling, we argue that attributes of successor CEOs significantly influence the reactions of key external constituencies. In particular, firms with more severe restatement tend to name successors who have prior CEO or turnaround experience and a more elite education. The naming of such successors results in more positive reactions from the stock market, financial analysts, and mass media.

We then use the fuzzy-set approach to qualitative comparitive analysis (QCA) to explore the combinations of governance mechanisms that exist among the S&P 1500 firms that achieve high (and not-high) profitability. Our findings suggest that high profits result when CEO incentive alignment and monitoring mechanisms work together as complements rather than as substitutes.

The processes we describe help explain responses to adversity and also provide a platform for research that may generate new insights into the significance for founders of bringing ""who I am"" into closer alignment with ""who I want to be.""

To help to explain this maladaptive tendency, we tested the hypothesis that managers with low managerial self-efficacy (that is, low perceived ability to meet the elevated competence expectations associated with managerial roles) seek to minimize voice as a way of compensating for a threatened ego. The results of two studies support this idea. In a field study (Study 1), managers with low managerial self-efficacy were less likely than others to solicit input, leading to lower levels of employee voice. A follow-up experimental study (Study 2) showed that: (a) manipulating low managerial self-efficacy led to voice aversion (that is, decreased voice solicitation, negative evaluations of an employee who spoke up, and reduced implementation of voice); and (b) the observed voice aversion associated with low managerial self-efficacy was driven by ego defensiveness. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings, as well as highlight directions for future research on voice, management, and leadership. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Building from theory on representational gaps, we explain why coordination between teams in multiteam systems can be hindered by inconsistencies that exist between them regarding the definition of shared problems. We argue that frame-ofreference training, an intervention that is theorized to reduce representational gaps, can facilitate coordination and subsequent performance in multiteam systems. We studied the effects of frame-of-reference training on multiteam system coordination and performance in 249 multiteam systems comprised of specialized teams. Supporting our expectations, we found that: (a) frame-of-reference training had a positive effect on multiteam system performance by enhancing between-team coordination; (b) withinteam coordination improved the relationship between frame-of-reference training and between-team coordination, ultimately improving multiteam system performance; and (c) the patterns by which within-team coordination leveraged our intervention depended on teams' specific functions. Our findings extend representational gaps theory, highlight the interdependencies between team-level and system-level coordination, and demonstrate the utility of frame-of-reference training in a new setting. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We propose that social self-regulation in culturally diverse teams manifests itself as performance monitoring (i.e., individuals' actions to meet team performance standards and peer expectations). Contingent on the status associated with individuals' cultural background, performance monitoring is proposed to have a curvilinear relationship with individual performance and to mediate between cultural dissimilarity and performance. Multilevel moderated mediation analyses of time-lagged data from 316 members of 69 teams confirmed these hypotheses. Cultural dissimilarity had a negative relationship with performance monitoring for high cultural-status members, and a positive relationship for low cultural-status members. Performance monitoring had a curvilinear relationship with individual performance that became decreasingly positive. Cultural dissimilarity thus was increasingly negatively associated with performance for high culturalstatus members, and decreasingly positively for low cultural-status members. These findings suggest that cultural dissimilarity to the team is not unconditionally negative for the individual but, in moderation, may in fact have positive motivational effects. ©Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Prior work has examined legal and timing defenses that enable interorganizational ties by such low-power firms; we focus here on social defenses. In a longitudinal study of equity tie formation between young firms and established corporate ""sharks,"" spanning five technology-based industries and 25 years, we unpack the effects of social defenses and find, intriguingly, that centrally positioned third parties are a particularly powerful social defense and that third-party social defenses are especially significant when more traditional defenses are unavailable.

We then consider how these differences are reflected in a firm's board structure (i.e., directorship interlocks, director experiences, and director tenures). Specifically, we predict that family firms are more likely to interlock with other family firms, select directors with more experience in family firms, and keep directors on their boards longer. Correspondingly, we posit that family firms are less likely to interlock with lone-founder firms or to select directors with experience in lone-founder-controlled firms. Lone-founder firms follow a similar pattern. We also consider the consequences of family and lone-founder ownership and board structures on the investment behavior of three classes of institutional investors.

Analyzing 1,251 realized matches and 12,510 nonrealized matches among knowledge providers and problems posted over a 32-month period on an online discussion forum within a global engineering firm, we find evidence to support our claim that attention allocation is driven by the features of a particular provider-problem match, thereby shifting the discourse from knowledge provider-seeker relationships to knowledge provider-problem matches.

Instead, firms terminate or avoid ties that expose their knowledge to indirectly linked rivals (""pruning"" and ""grafting"") and embed themselves in dense networks (""closing"") to prevent strategic knowledge spillover. Through a longitudinal study of German board interlocks during 1990-2003, we find that firms are more likely to prune, graft, and close their networks as they accumulate strategic knowledge and as the firms to which they are interlocked increasingly generate indirect ties to competitors, even when controlling for dyadic safeguards discussed by prior research. We capture strategic knowledge by tracking firms' experience in the former Warsaw Pact countries from immediately after the sudden fall of communism in 1990 until 2003.

It is relatively well established that conflict and dis-identification arise under such conditions. In the socially responsible retail company I studied, in contrast, I found identification as well as dis-identification. Both outcomes emerged from members' interactions with others whose values and behaviors differed from their own. Identification arose when managers interpreted and enacted organizational values for frontline employees by developing integrative solutions, removing ideology, and routinizing ideology. Dis-identification developed in the absence of these practices. The resulting process model suggests a relational ecology of identification, in which identification emerges from the combination of bottom-up interactive processes among organizational members and top-down interpretations and enactments by managers. This model advances understanding of the relational dynamics of identification, offers new insight into how organizations can benefit from multiple identities, and illuminates the double-edged sword of ideology in organizations.

Because titles do not always reflect the unique value that employees bring to their jobs, some organizations have recently experimented with encouraging employees to create their own job titles. To explore the psychological implications of self-reflective job titles, we conducted field research combining inductive qualitative and deductive experimental methods. In Study 1, a qualitative study at the Make-A-Wish Foundation, we were surprised to learn that employees experienced self-reflective job titles as reducing their emotional exhaustion. We triangulated interviews, observations, and archival documents to identify three explanatory mechanisms through which self-reflective job titles may operate: selfverification, psychological safety, and external rapport. In Study 2, a field quasiexperiment within a health care system, we found that employees who created selfreflective job titles exprienced less emotional exhaustion five weeks later, whereas employees in two control groups did not. These effects were mediated by increases in self-verification and psychological safety, but not external rapport.

Sequencing, which distinguishes dynamic allocation regimes more generally, is associated with higher new product sales. Low initial commitment and reallocation do not show individual direct effects on new product sales. However, when assessed as a match, we find that the fit between low initial commitment and reallocation (yes-yes; no-no) increases performance significantly. After controlling for such fit as well as sequencing, we find no significant performance difference between real options logic and other regimes. Our findings imply that insufficient identification of real options logic picks up confounding effects, which may provide an explanation for the inconclusive results in prior studies of real options and performance.

To understand this heterogeneity, we conceptualize such contamination as a generalization-instantiation process: investors generalize the culpability to the industry category and perceive the instantiation of generalized culpability within the industry bystander firms. This theoretical separation allows us to hypothesize the factors that affect the degree to which both of these elements of the contamination process occurs. Specifically, we predict that characteristics of the misconduct firm or event-factors that lend to investors' familiarity with the misconduct firms, or that prompt attributions of blame for the misconduct-affect the potency of the generalization of culpability to the industry, while characteristics of the industry bystander firms-investors' familiarity with such firms, or factors that lend to investors' perceptions that they have strong governance-affect the firms' vulnerability to being perceived as instantiating the generalized culpability.

I argue that transfers of parent firm knowledge provide different advantages to foreign operations, depending on the technological characteristics of the foreign country and the type of knowledge transferred. Results from a comprehensive panel of U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs), using fixed effects and system general method of moments (GMM) models to correct for endogeneity issues, show that inherited parent firm knowledge is not equally valuable in all countries. The transfer of technological knowledge is value-creating when home country innovation dominates and when parent firm knowledge is transferred to foreign operations in lagging technology countries (when foreign technology dominates). Further, combining managerial knowledge transfers with local subsidiary investments in innovation is shown to boost the performance of foreign operations located in leading technology countries, suggesting that the prior experiences, connections, and knowledge of expatriate managers, can be particularly useful in managing new knowledge generated in these countries. Overall, this paper extends our understanding of knowledge management within MNCs by exploring when transfers of parent technological and managerial knowledge are more likely to improve the performance of foreign operations in increasingly globally competitive industries. © 2015 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Building on signaling theory, we develop and test a model of the incentive and sorting effects of pay secrecy - a pay communication policy that limits employees' access to pay-related information and discourages the discussion of pay issues - under varying pay-for-performance (PFP) system characteristics. Results of a multiround laboratory simulation largely support the proposed moderated-mediation model. They indicate that pay secrecy has an adverse impact on individual task performance that is mediated by PFP perceptions, amplified when pay determination criteria are relative (as opposed to absolute), and attenuated when performance assessment is objective (as opposed to subjective). Results also indicate that pay secrecy has a similar adverse effect on participant continuation intentions (mediated through PFP perceptions, amplified when pay determination criteria are relative, and attenuated when performance assessment is objective), particularly among high performers. These findings suggest that weak signals associated with a particular managerial practice may become salient when interpreted in the context of other practice-based signals and that, under such conditions, even weak signals may drive negative-oriented inferences, having important behavioral implications. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

While a linear, clocktime orientation optimized for markets is meant to enhance efficiency, coordination, and control, it may be unsuitable for managing emergent, complex, and indeterminate processes such as development. To examine how the tension between market and development temporalities plays out at the organizational level, we draw on an ethnography of Fairtrade International, an organization connecting markets in the North with low-income community development in the South. We examine intra-organizational contestation over different temporal structures needed to entrain to discrepant temporal environments. We explain how contestation, temporal reflexivity, interpretive shifts, and mutual appreciation of interdependencies led to the reconstitution of Fairtrade's development model to bridge competing temporal structures. We contribute by (a) elucidating an agentic view of time, where time is used as a cultural resource to regulate attention and render social phenomena amenable to particular types of managerial action; (b) developing the notion of ""ambitemporality,"" where organizations accommodate seemingly contradictory temporal orientations; and (c) explaining how deep-seated Western organizational mentalities truncate the power of development models, and how these models may benefit from embracing processual approaches associated with Eastern thought. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Although scholars have long considered how leaders communicate visions and values to establish a sense of purpose, they have overlooked how these messages can be used to establish a shared sense of purpose, which is achieved when multiple employees possess the same understanding of the purpose of work. In this research, we move beyond the traditional focus on leader rhetoric and individual cognition to examine leader rhetoric and shared cognition. We suggest that a specific combination of messages - a large amount of vision imagery combined with a small number of values - will boost performance more than other combinations because it triggers a shared sense of the organization's ultimate goal, and, in turn, enhances coordination. We found support for our predictions in an archival study of 151 hospitals and an experiment with 62 groups of full-time employees.

We also find that, although the relationship between female board representation and market performance is near zero the relationship is positive in countries with greater gender parity (and negative in countries with low gender parity)-perhaps because societal gender differences in human capital may influence investors' evaluations of the future earning potential of firms that have more female directors.

In Study 1, we demonstrate that self-control capacity, motivation to self-control (supervisor coercive power), and abusive supervision interact in such a way that the strongest association between abusive supervision and supervisor-directed aggression occurs when subordinates are low in self-control capacity and perceive their supervisor to be low in coercive power.

On the other hand, preserving the already established reputation requires a firm to deliver consistent performance over time, which promotes greater use of risk reduction strategies.

Using data from a longitudinal study of United Nations climate conferences, we analyze how regular and high-stakes events in an event series interacted in producing and preventing institutional change in the transnational climate policy field. We uncover variations in event structures, processes, and outcomes that explain why climate conferences have not led to effective solutions to combat human-induced global warming. Results in particular highlight that growing field complexity and issue multiplication compromise the change potential of a field-configuring event series in favor of field maintenance. Over time, diverse actors find event participation useful for their own purposes, but their activity is not connected to the institutions at the center of the issue-based field. In discussing how events configuring a field are purposefully staged and enacted but also influenced by developments in the field, our study contributes to a more complete understanding of field-configuring events, particularly in contested transnational policy arenas. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

In Study 1-an inductive, qualitative study-we develop theory about how environmental issue supporters evaluate themselves in a mixed fashion, positively around having assets (self-assets) and negatively around questioning their performance (self-doubts). We explain how these ongoing self-evaluations, which we label situated self-work, are shaped by cognitive, relational, and organizational challenges individuals interpret about an issue from a variety of life domains (work, home, or school). In Study 2-an inductive, quantitative, observational study-we derive three profiles of environmental issue supporters' mixed selves (self-affirmers, self-critics, and self-equivocators) and relate these profiles to real issue-supportive behaviors. We empirically validate key constructs from Study 1 and show that even among the most dedicated issue supporters, doubts play an important role in their experiences and may be either enabling or damaging, depending on the composition of their mixed selves. Our research offers a richer view of both how contexts shape social issue support and how individuals' self-evaluations play a meaningful role in understanding the experiences and, ultimately, the issue-supportive behaviors of individuals working on social issues. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Building on moral self-regulation theory (Bandura, 1991), we propose that entrepreneurs' assessments of the attractiveness of opportunities that harm the natural environment depend on the simultaneous impact of values and personal agency. By cognitively disengaging their pro-environmental values, decision makers (i.e., entrepreneurs) can (under certain circumstances) perceive opportunities that harm the environment as highly attractive and thus suitable for exploitation. The results of a judgment task that generated 1,264 opportunity assessments nested within 83 business founders offered support for this general prediction and indicated that the extent of founders' disengagement of their pro-environmental values was stronger when they had high, rather than low, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and stronger when industry munificence was perceived as low rather than high.

Relying on an inductive comparative case study of four work integration social enterprises embedded in competing social welfare and commercial logics, we show that, instead of adopting strategies of decoupling or compromising, as the literature typically suggests, these organizations selectively coupled intact elements prescribed by each logic. This strategy allowed them to project legitimacy to external stakeholders without having to engage in costly deceptions or negotiations. We further identify a specific hybridization pattern that we refer to as ""Trojan horse,"" whereby organizations that entered the work integration field with low legitimacy because of their embeddedness in the commercial logic strategically incorporated elements from the social welfare logic in an attempt to gain legitimacy and acceptance. Surprisingly, they did so more than comparable organizations originating from the social welfare logic. These findings suggest that, when lacking legitimacy in a given field, hybrids may manipulate the templates provided by the multiple logics in which they are embedded in an attempt to gain acceptance. Overall, our findings contribute to a better understanding of how organizations can survive and thrive when embedded in pluralistic institutional environments. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Then, we investigated the real-world implications of selling orientation in a field study (Study 2) with two different samples (Samples A and B) and found that a selling orientation negatively influenced the predictive validity of interviewers judgments. Specifically, when selling orientation was low, interviewers judgments accurately predicted which applicants would be most (and least) successful as newcomers in the organization (in terms of citizenship, performance, and fit). However, when selling orientation was high, interviewers judgments no longer predicted applicant outcomes.

U.S. Army soldiers were examined at the beginning, middle, and end of an intensive, 14-week residential entry program of training and collective socialization. Cross-lagged structural equation analyses supported a causal relationship of individuals' cognition-based trust with affect-based trust directed toward their unit peers and, separately, their leaders. Individuals with high levels of chronic relational identity exhibited a stronger timelagged relationship between cognition-based trust and affect-based trust for trust in peers but not for trust in a leader.

Yet the very emotions that spur employees to express voice may compromise their ability to do so constructively, preventing managers from reacting favorably. I propose that to speak up frequently and constructively, employees need knowledge about effective strategies for managing emotions. Building on theories of emotion regulation, I develop a theoretical model that explains the role of managing emotions in the incidence and outcomes of voice. In a field study at a health care company, emotion regulation knowledge (1) predicted more frequent voice, (2) mediated by the emotional labor strategies of deep acting and surface acting, and (3) enhanced the contributions of voice to performance evaluations. These results did not generalize to helping behaviors, demonstrating that emotion regulation uniquely affects challenging but not affiliative interpersonal citizenship behaviors.

Prior work has focused on the stigma of incompetence as the primary mechanism that links AAPs to performance; however, the broader social psychological literature suggests that additional mechanisms may also play a role. We use stereotyping theories to develop a more comprehensive model of the pathways through which AAPs limit targets' performance outcomes. Drawing from the stereotype content model, we propose that the negative effect of AAPs on others' evaluations of targets' performance is driven by perceptions of incompetence and low warmth. Drawing from stereotype threat theory, we propose that the negative effect of AAPs on targets' self-evaluated and objective performance is driven by perceptions of low self-competence, negative state affect, nd perceived stereotyping by others. Meta-analytic path analyses support our hypotheses. Our theory and findings demonstrate that multiple mechanisms explain the negative consequences of AAPs for targets' performance outcomes, highlight differences in reactions to AAP targets by others versus the self, and provide insight into preventing the unintended negative effects of AAPs. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

We hypothesized that these signal-based mechanisms mediate the relationships between CSP and organizational attractiveness, focusing on two aspects of CSP: an organization's community involvement and pro-environmental practices.

In spite of this, relatively little is known about what impacts shareholders' preferences and, subsequently, their ultimate voting behavior.

Per agency theory, shareholders, as principals, will disapprove of high CEO rewards and poor firm performance, symmetrically assessing gains and losses. Per prospect theory, shareholders will be loss averse, responding much more strongly to being in a loss position than to being in a gain or neutral position. We combine these theories' predictions in two lab experiments in which we simulate a shareholder say-on-pay vote, hypothesizing that shareholders will be concerned with agency costs, but only when they are in a loss position. The results of these simulated votes suggest that shareholders do value pay for performance, in keeping with agency theory. However, shareholders exhibit this focus on agencynormative prescriptions asymmetrically, showing loss aversion in keeping with prospect theory.

We examine how the amount and locus (advertiser vs. agency) of managerial exit and the hierarchical level from which exit occurs (executives vs. exchange managers) influence the likelihood that dyadic market ties will dissolve. We theorize that managerial exit disrupts dyadic market ties through its effect on three mechanisms of social capital: investments in relationship-specific assets; formal control over market ties; and the intensity of interaction with exchange partners. We consider how market tie fragility, the financial performance of advertisers, and the duration of market ties condition the effects of managerial exit on market tie dissolution. In short, we theorize about which managerial roles matter more to market tie dissolution, why they matter and when they matter. Using longitudinal data on 232 dyadic ties between advertisers and New York City advertising agencies, we find that the number of executives and exchange managers who exit on both sides of market ties affects tie dissolution.

We also consider how leadership influences the intervening role of justice in the stressor-job performance relationships by virtue of the effect it has on how stressors are interpreted with regard to fairness. Results of a study of 339 employees and their supervisors provide support for this model across dimensions of performance. Somewhat unexpectedly, the moderating effect of leadership is found to be contingent on the type of leadership and the type of stressors. Transactional leaders reduce the negative effect of hindrance stressors on job performance because they weaken the negative link between hindrance stressors and justice perceptions. Alternatively, transformational leaders enhance the positive effect of challenge stressors on job performance because they foster a positive link between challenge stressors and justice perceptions. We discuss how this intriguing pattern of moderated mediation could be explained by using theory and research on regulatory focus. © Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

Given that employees spend a considerable amount of time at work, understanding how they can replenish their resources during the workday is critical. Drawing on ego depletion (Muraven & Baumeister, 2000) and self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), we employed multi-source experience sampling methods to test the effects of a critical boundary condition, employee lunch break autonomy, on the relation between lunch break activities and end-of-workday fatigue. Although specific energy-relevant activities had a main effect on end-of-workday fatigue, each of these was moderated by the degree of autonomous choice associated with the break. Specifically, for activities that supported the psychological needs of relatedness and competence (i.e., social and work activities, respectively), as lunch break autonomy increased, effects switched from increasing fatigue to reducing fatigue. To the extent that lunch break activities involved relaxation, however, lunch break autonomy was only important when levels of relaxation were low. We conclude that lunch break autonomy plays a complex and pivotal role in conferring the potential energetic benefits of lunch break activities.

Using the patent data of a leading U.S. microprocessor manufacturer, we constructed the firm's collaboration and knowledge networks, and examined the effects of two structural features in the two networks-structural holes and degree centrality-on researchers' exploratory innovation. Our findings show that a researcher with knowledge elements rich in structural holes in the knowledge network tends to explore fewer new knowledge elements from outside the firm, while structural holes in the collaboration network increase exploratory innovation. The average degree centrality of a researcher's knowledge elements in the knowledge network has an inverted-U-shaped relationship with his or her exploratory innovation, while degree centrality in the collaboration network has a negative effect.

We predict and find that Reg-FD activated mutual forbearance among analysts linked through multipoint contact. We also predict and find that high-status analysts forbear more strongly.

Network communities represent dense and nonoverlapping structural groups of actors in a social system. A network community lens helps identify new ways to study firms' access to diverse knowledge inputs in a dynamic system of interorganizational relationships. Specifically, we examine how the membership dynamics of a network community affect the invention productivity of member firms by either enabling or constraining access to broad, diverse knowledge inputs. Our findings suggest, first, that a firm reaps the greatest invention benefits in a network community with moderate levels of membership turnover. Second, a firm attains the greatest invention productivity when its own rate of movement across different network communities is moderate. Third, we find that community members located in the core of their network community can benefit more from membership dynamics and prior community affiliations than those on its periphery. In empirical analyses, we use the evolving community structure of the network of interorganizational partnerships in the global computer industry over 1981-2001 to predict firms' patenting rates. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Relational pluralism is instantiated in the board of directors, whose network of relationships influence a new venture's ability to establish external links beyond the networks of the founding team. We argue that relational pluralism speeds the establishment of a diverse alliance portfolio, which, in turn, speeds the attainment of major revenue milestones in a new firm. We examine these ideas in a population of de novo semiconductor firms and find that diverse alliance portfolios emerge faster when a board includes members with heterogeneous, multiplex relationships, as well as central network positions. However, the asymmetric influence of outside board members can have both positive and negative effects: the alliance formation process is aided by outsiders in central network positions, but impeded when central investors dominate the board.

We refine the BAM's original formulation and provide an explanation for previous conflicting empirical results by theorizing that the anticipation of prospective wealth attenuates the negative effect of accumulated current equity wealth upon CEO strategic risk taking. In doing so, we offer an advancement of the dialectic between: (1) classical agency scholars, arguing that equity-based pay leads to more risk taking, and (2) behavioral scholars, arguing that equity wealth creates risk bearing, leading to less risk taking. We also suggest that the influences of prospective wealth and current wealth on strategic risk taking depend on the extent to which agents can manage the risk inherent in their compensation package and agent vulnerability to losses. Formal hypotheses to test these expectations are made by focusing on equity-based compensation.

Studies 1 and 2 extend self-concept maintenance theory (Mazar, Amir, & Ariely, 2008) by exploring the mediated process through which subconscious ethical and unethical primes trigger the activation of moral standards, thereby influencing categorization and subsequent responses to morally ambiguous situations.

We find that institutional change occurs in mature organizational fields when organizations located at the field center, periphery, and in between trigger different multilevel processes. Our results show that when society-level evolutionary change created organization-level resource pressures that undermined the central values of a mature field, the group of actors between the field center and periphery served as intermediaries in the institutional change process bringing the societal, field, and organizational levels back into alignment.

Evidence suggests that congruent frames of heterogeneous communication practices enabled one group to develop communication norms that circumvented the trap of constant connectivity, while assumptions of homogeneous communication practices in the other group led to expanded accessibility and erosion of personal time. This study examines how such alternate trajectories of use emerged and discusses the key dimensions of difference between groups-identity, materiality, vulnerability, and visibility-that help account for these differences. In introducing the distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous trajectories of use and explicating how such trajectories emerge, this study offers several theoretical insights: it suggests that there is a distinction between the congruence of technological frames of reference and the content of these frames; it provides an explanation for why groups might enact mobile communication technologies in a manner that does not lead to constant connectivity; and it highlights how shared assumptions of heterogeneity relate to systems of social control. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

While the effect of this institutional order on the revenue growth of new ventures is negative, a network's structural holes have a positive effect on revenue growth.

The frequency and magnitude of conflicts increase the perception of likelihood of opportunism, and dyad-specific risks materially affect the context in which firms make alliance decisions. As animosity between two nations increases, the number and the probability of forming alliances within the dyad the nations form decreases. Conditional on the expected number of alliances, increased antagonistic actions of nations outside the dyad and dissimilarity in the historical conflicts that each nation has engaged in outside the dyad (i) increase the number of equity alliances and (ii) decrease the number of nonequity alliances as a proportion of total alliances.

This article develops a process model of navigating such paradoxes: in sensemaking about paradoxical outcomes, actors grapple with definition of success and can transform the organizational logic. The result can be oscillation among logics, or novel synthesis between them when outside perspectives enable a clearer view of the paradox.

We apply and advance structural balance theory to examine the formation of balanced and unbalanced dyadic and triadic structures, and to explore how these dynamics aggregate to shape the emergence of a global network. Our findings are threefold. First, we find that existing collaborative or conflictual relationships between two companies engender future relationships of the same type, but crowd out relationships of the different type. This results in (a) an increased likelihood of the formation of balanced (uniplex) relationships that combine multiple ties of either collaboration or conflict, and (b) a reduced likelihood of the formation of unbalanced (multiplex) relationships that combine collaboration and conflict between the same two firms. Second, we find that network formation is driven not by a pull toward balanced triads, but rather by a pull away from unbalanced triads. Third, we find that the observed micro-level dynamics of dyads and triads affect the structural segregation of the global network into two separate collaborative and conflictual segments of firms.

Integrating insights from real options theory with logic from the individual differences literature, we hypothesize and find that individuals who are risk averse and have low core self-evaluation are more likely to enter hybrid entrepreneurship relative to full-time self-employment. In turn, we argue and find that hybrid entrepreneurs who subsequently enter full-time self-employment (i.e., quit their day job) have much higher rates of survival relative to individuals who enter full-time self-employment directly from paid employment. Adding support to our theory that the survival advantage is driven by a learning effect that takes place during hybrid entrepreneurship, we find that the decrease in exit hazard is stronger for individuals with prior entrepreneurial experience.

We analyzed interview and network data from the head office of a recruiting agency. We found that managers active in the provision of emotion help thought of such help as over and above their managerial duties, whereas employees defined emotional support as managerial in-role behavior. Both parties accepted the necessity of controlling negative emotions for the good of the organization. But those being helped tended to perceive their helpers as doubly powerful figures, invested with both formal authority and parental authority, whereas the helpers saw themselves as reacting to situational contingencies to do favors for subordinates in need. Our results point to an emergent understanding of discrepant interpretations. Employees treat caring as part of the managers' role that requires no reciprocation, whereas managers see such help-giving as discretionary extra-role behavior that requires reciprocated commitment.

"Fdi spillovers over time in an emerging market: The roles of entry tenure and barriers to imitation","2014","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903615930&doi=10.5465%2famj.2011.0351&partnerID=40&md5=4f3f7c777a3211c33c7eef8bd6e0696c","In this study, we examine how foreign direct investment (FDI) spillovers to domestic firms in an emerging market occur over time. From the organizational learning perspective, we propose that, as entry tenure of foreign firms in an industry increases, domestic firms can learn from the foreign firms over time and improve their productivity. We further build upon the competitor imitation argument to propose that this effect will be stronger when barriers to imitation faced by the domestic firms are lower. Based upon a comprehensive panel dataset on manufacturing firms in China in 1998-2007, our findings strongly support these arguments. We find that entry tenure of foreign firms in an industry has a positive relationship with the productivity of individual domestic firms in the same industry, albeit at a diminishing rate. We also find that this positive relationship is stronger when the foreign firms have lower export intensity, lower intangible asset intensity, and have followed a more rhythmic (i.e., less irregular) entry pattern - situations characterizing lower barriers to imitation. © Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

In this paper, we explore this interaction, asking how an occupation's identity shapes and is shaped by its interactions with a new technology. We focus, specifically, on the relationship between librarians and Internet search. Drawing on an analysis of 22 years of articles from library journals, we demonstrate how and why librarians initially discounted Internet search and differentiated themselves from it. We argue that these responses were associated with a ""paradox of expertise,"" by which librarians missed innovation opportunities around one of the most important information technologies in history precisely, and ironically, because of their deep knowledge of non-Internet searching. Later, however, we demonstrate how librarians engaged with this same technology, drawing upon it to redefine their occupational identity. Our findings demonstrate how occupational identity conditions the interpretation of a technology, while also showing how these interpretations can change with ongoing interactions. We also illustrate how occupational identity itself can change in response to new technology. Finally, we elaborate upon why expert insiders may not actually be best positioned to pursue emerging technologies. © Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

We suggest that CEOs may resolve this dilemma by appointing new directors who have prior experiences working with other demographically similar CEOs. We then explain why this tendency is stronger when new directors are demographically more different from CEOs. Moreover, we posit that new directors' prior experiences with other similar CEOs will reduce the negative effect of their demographic differences from the CEO on CEO compensation. Longitudinal analysis of Fortune 500 companies' new director appointments and subsequent CEO compensation provided support for our theoretical expectations. This study identifies an important new role that interlock ties to other CEOs can play in corporate governance and leadership. In particular, we suggest that such ties are a means by which CEOs evaluate whether a new director will support their leadership and decision making. In explaining the role of directors' ties to other CEOs in influencing director appointments and CEO compensation, this study also highlights the important influence of triads on CEO-director dyadic relations. © Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

In doing so, I add clarity to a mixed literature that argues on the one hand that limited resources foster creativity, and on the other, that abundant resources foster creativity. Instead, I reorient the questions that scholars ask by shifting the conversation away from variance-explanation models and towards understanding organizational processes, specifically around how employees use resources in dynamic ways and how managers enable them to do so.

In a field study of professional baseball players (Study 1), we found that although low-status players' performance quality was unaffected by status loss, the quality of high-status players' performance declined significantly after losing status. In a high-involvement group experiment (Study 2), we found that high-status individuals who lost status were less proficient than both high-status individuals who did not lose status and low-status individuals who lost a comparable amount of status.

An inductive analysis suggests that this process does not follow the simple find-and-copy model often assumed in the literature and identifies four distinct subprocesses involved: identification, translation, adoption, and continuation. This process model adds to understanding of vicarious learning by showing that it is a more varied process than it is commonly construed to be and that not only experienceseeking groups, but also groups that are the source of the experience, play important and shifting roles throughout.

By contrast, status-dominated power source mismatch weakened the positive effect of power source match, because it may have created disorderly interaction.

We complement previous research on acquisition premiums by suggesting that signals about targets can enhance sellers' gains by reducing acquirers' offer price discounting that is due to information asymmetries. Specifically, we argue that target firms can engage in interorganizational relationships (e.g., associations with prominent investment banks, venture capitalists, and alliance partners) that function as signals and enhance sellers' gains. Empirical evidence shows that the benefits of such signals apply to domestic and cross-border deals alike and that these benefits are even greater for IPO targets selling their companies to acquirers based in different industries. © 2012 Academy of Management Journal.","",""

The embeddedness of founding teams in a community logic makes them more committed and more capable of attracting local support, resulting in greater establishment rates for their enterprises. By contrast, embeddedness in a financial logic leads to more likely team dissolution. High embeddedness in both logics simultaneously has a positive effect on the likelihood of establishment in stable economic periods, but a negative effect in turbulent periods. Qualitative evidence suggests that the existence of factions in a founding team - more likely in turbulent periods - could account for such a difference. Drawing on a mix of archival data on bank founding teams and interview data, this article links logics, founder backgrounds, and entrepreneurial success. Variation in founder backgrounds influences establishment rates for reasons that can be traced back to community and financial logics. This study thus links literatures on competing logics, founder motivations, and entrepreneurship. By showing the contingent effect of economic stability on the successful integration of logics within founding groups and thus on entrepreneurial establishment, this study also contributes to research on institutional complexity and ambidexterity. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Analyses of longitudinal multilevel data collected from 5,270 employees in 175 business units of a hospitality company demonstrate a significant three-way interactive effect of unit-level job satisfaction trajectory and its dispersion and individual job satisfaction trajectory on individual job exit. In particular, in the presence of a negative unit-level job satisfaction trajectory and low dispersion, a positive change in individual-level job satisfaction does not affect the odds of a person leaving an organization. Put differently, an employee's being out of step with prevailing unit-level attitudes appears to alter the relationship between his or her job satisfaction trajectory and turnover propensity. Further, unit-level job-satisfaction change and its dispersion jointly influence the overall turnover rate in a unit. The results indicate unit-level and individual-level job satisfaction trajectories have unique multilevel influences on turnover above and beyond static levels of job satisfaction. Accounting for these dynamics substantially increases the explained variance in turnover behavior.

The positive philanthropyperformance relationship is stronger for firms with greater public visibility and for those with better past performance, as philanthropy by these firms gains more positive stakeholder responses. Firms that are not government-owned or politically well connected were shown to benefit more from philanthropy, as gaining political resources is more critical for such firms.

Specifically, we propose that a firm's position in an industry divestiture wave conveys information about whether or not managers are imitating their industry peers, which in turn will influence how investors perceive and assess the quality of the decision and its likely performance consequences. Supporting this theoretical argument, we find that the relationship between divestiture position and stock market returns exhibits a U-shaped pattern, with divestitures that occur at the peak of an industry divestiture wave generating the lowest stock market returns. We also find that industry characteristics (e.g., munificence) reinforce the effect of position in wave on investor response. Our study is the first to incorporate the role of a firm's social context, assessed in terms of the pervasiveness of an activity, as an important factor that influences how investors perceive and evaluate divestiture decisions. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

In an in-depth study of 17 multinational corporations involving 359 interviews with internal and external actors, we find that firms facing identical pressures decouple policy from practice in different ways and for different reasons. When firms' responses are generated locally, without firmwide coordination, these responses can be either intentional or emergent. In the presence of information asymmetry between firms and their stakeholders, we find that managers' responses are intentional (""faking it"") and depend on how they perceive their interests. In the presence of competing stakeholder expectations, responses are emergent (""muddling through"") and depend on the degree of consensus among managers in their readings of the environment. These findings suggest that theories of decoupling need to be broadened to include the role of ""muddling through"" and the interplay of internal managerial and external stakeholder dynamics. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Managers' perceptions of employees' commitment, in turn, shape employees' career success. Field- and laboratory-based studies provide strong support for the hypothesis that FWP use results in career premiums when managers make productivity attributions and some support for the hypothesis that FWP use results in career penalties when managers make personal life attributions. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

In a field and an experimental study, we find that extraversion is associated with status losses and disappointing expectations for contributions to group tasks and neuroticism is associated with status gains due to surpassing expectations for group-task contributions. Whereas personality may inform status expectations through perceptions of competence when groups first form, as group members work together interdependently over time, actual contributions to the group's task are an important basis for reallocating status. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

Specifically, I conduct an event study around the announcement of corporate news related to environment for all US publicly traded companies from 1980 to 2009. In keeping with the view that environmental corporate social responsibility (CSR) generates new and competitive resources for firms, I find that companies reported to behave responsibly toward the environment experience a significant stock price increase, whereas firms that behave irresponsibly face a significant decrease. Extending this view of ""environment-as-a-resource,"" I posit that the value of environmental CSR depends on external and internal moderators. First, I argue that external pressure to behave responsibly towards the environment-which has increased dramatically over recent decades-exacerbates the punishment for eco-harmful behavior and reduces the reward for eco-friendly initiatives. This argument is supported by the data: over time, the negative stock market reaction to eco-harmful behavior has increased, while the positive reaction to eco-friendly initiatives has decreased. Second, I argue that environmental CSR is a resource with decreasing marginal returns and insurance-like features. In keeping with this view, I find that the positive (negative) stock market reaction to eco-friendly (-harmful) events is smaller for companies with higher levels of environmental CSR. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

This study investigates how the scientific and regulatory certifications that a firm receives affect rivals' entries into a new technical field it pioneers.

The combination of these two prospect theory derivatives led us to hypothesize that family firms usually invest less in R&D than nonfamily firms but the variability of their investments will be greater owing to differences in the compatibility of long- and short-term family goals with the economic goals of a firm. However, when performance is below aspiration levels, we theorize that family goals and economic goals tend to converge. In this situation, the R&D investments of family firms are expected to increase and the variability of those investments decrease, relative to nonfamily firms.

By examining how firms manage the trade-off between inimitability and nonsubstitutability, this study suggests that the scenario wherein firms have omnipotent resources that are both inimitable and nonsubstitutable may be unrealistic and that managing the tension between these two attributes is key to sustainable competitive advantage. © Academy of Management Journal.","",""

One could conceive of a very interesting policy-capturing study in which that overall recommendation was regressed on the nine criteria with the purpose of determining which had the most impact on reviewers judgments. However, our sense is that reviewers must be free to use their own weighting schemes when making their recommendations. Some reviewers may weigh theoretical contribution and interestingness above all else; others might prioritize technical adequacy and empirical contribution; and still others might use a completely different model.

Results based on 100 work groups in a manufacturing firm indicate that group-level OCB significantly moderated the relationship between individual-level OCB and job performance. Comparing contexts in which group-level OCB was rare with those in which it was prevalent, we found that high individual-level OCB yielded greater significant increases in job performance ratings when group-level OCB was rare.

Using a sample of 463 R&D alliances in the telecommunications equipment industry, I find that alliances contribute far more to firm innovation when technological diversity is moderate, rather than low or high. Although this relationship holds irrespective of alliance organization, I find that hierarchical organization, such as an equity joint venture, improves firm benefits from alliances with high levels of technological diversity. Thus, alliance organizational form likely influences partner ability and incentives to share information, which affects performance.

Building on Stinchombe's (1965) arguments concerning new ventures' liability of newness, we hypothesize that new ventures with higher founding team formalization, specialization, and administrative intensity outperform those with more organic organizational structures. Results support these hypotheses.","",""

In a longitudinal, multiple-informant study of 93 organizations, we found that human, organizational, and social capital and their interrelationships selectively influenced incremental and radical innovative capabilities. As anticipated, organizational capital positively influenced incremental innovative capability, while human capital interacted with social capital to positively influence radical innovative capability. Counter to our expectations, however, human capital by itself was negatively associated with radical innovative capability. Interestingly, social capital played a significant role in both types of innovation, as it positively influenced incremental and radical innovative capabilities.","",""

The nine articles in this special research forum provide evidence on how forms have changed, as well as on which aspects of traditional theorizing are likely to continue to be robust. Core themes reflected are an acceptance of contradiction and paradox, a shift in the goal of organizing from buffering against uncertainty to responding to it, a strategic focus on structure and process design, a reemphasis on the social and interpersonal, and a reemergence of issues of legitimacy.","",""

The key insight is that the density-dependence theory is consistent with many microprocesses that regulate the birth, survival, and death of individual organizations. However, the population-level relationship between density and organizational vital rates is highly sensitive to the range and rules of local interaction among individual organizations.","",""

Effects of culture and group-based motivation","1996","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030300581&doi=10.2307%2f257067&partnerID=40&md5=100d0f67dddc26d7ebb3a23460977aa1","This study examined four causes of group performance loss: goal specificity, communication, incentives for goal attainment, and high versus low cultural collectivism. Subjects were managers from Israeli kibbutzim (63 individuals) and cities (59 individuals) who worked on a simulated task requiring them to evaluate résumés. We used a two-by-three-by-four design in which sample, goal, and test condition were varied to test hypotheses. Group performance loss occurred only for urban respondents with a do-your-best goal and team task.","",""
"Goverance, ownership, and corporate entrepreneurship: The moderating impact of industry technological opportunities","1996","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030300582&doi=10.2307%2f257076&partnerID=40&md5=fd0247c7228773267fa89237a71553ae","Corporate entrepreneurship is important for organizational survival, profitability, growth, and renewal. Data from 127 Fortune 500 companies show that executive stock ownership and long-term institutional ownership are positively associated with such entrepreneurship. Conversely, short-term institutional ownership is negatively associated with it, as is a high ratio of outside directors on a company's board. Outside directors' stock ownership somewhat mitigates the latter negative association. Outsiders, including stock owners, might lead companies away from internal product development, the traditional route to corporate entrepreneurship. Finally, an industry's technological opportunities moderate the associations observed between corporate governance and ownership variables and corporate entrepreneurship.","",""
"Competitive dynamics of interfirm rivalry","1996","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030304387&doi=10.2307%2f256781&partnerID=40&md5=d962783aeb20c5bbeff4861a7c7c0ec4","In this study, we examined how firm-specific competitive conditions influence firms' patterns of market entry and exit, focusing on two features of firms' competitive conditions: market domain overlap, which measures the potential for competition, and multimarket contact, which measures the potential for mutual forbearance. A dynamic analysis of California commuter airlines from 1979 through 1984 showed that increases in market domain overlap raised airlines' rates of market entry and exit, but increases in multimarket contact lowered them, especially in markets clearly dominated by a single airline. Thus, paradoxically, close competitors are not the most intense rivals: airlines that meet in multiple markets are less aggressive toward each other than those that meet in one or a few markets.","",""

New subordinates (n = 205) and their supervisors (n = 112) provided data that were used to test hypotheses stating that dyadic gender and personality similarity, member performance, and leader delegation would be incrementally and cumulatively related to LMX development. Support was found for relationships between the quality of leader-member exchange and positive affectivity similarity, performance, and delegation, but not for a relationship with gender similarity. In addition, it appears that good member performance may precede leader delegation.","",""

Level of task programmability was associated with an increased use of variable pay, and long-term relationships between an agent and principal were associated with decreased use. Results supported the classical organizationtheory prediction that under higher risk, organizations use higher proportions of variable pay; but results question agency theory's ability to predict compensation strategy for middle-level managers in the high-risk situation.","",""

We empirically explored the expertness of these informants in terms of interrater reliability and accuracy of their ratings compared to those provided by insiders. Four groups of outside informants in the airline industry-consultants, security analysts, stakeholders, and academics- and senior airline executives whose companies initiated certain competitive moves rated strategic attributes associated with those moves. Informants in each group manifested high interrater reliability. Of the outsiders, analysts were the most accurate and were highly reliable, and academics were highly reliable and as accurate as consultants and stakeholders.","",""

For the period 1982-92, we found that investors tended to view early retirement programs favorably. These positive market responses further appeared to be influenced by the institutional rationale for a workforce reduction, the timing of a reduction's announcement, firm size, the restriction of an early retirement program to white-collar employees, and the physical size of the public announcements of a program.","",""

In an agency context, we examined the influence of equity ownership structure upon corporate risk taking. Results support our premise that the wealth portfolios of corporate insiders may influence firm risk taking. They also support our analysis of entrenchment theory and our presumption that financial and nonfinancial benefits or costs may, at high levels of stock ownership, induce executive decisions inconsistent with growth-oriented risk taking. Institutional owners exerted a significant, positive influence on risk taking, but the role of blockholders was negligible. Finally, ownership structure affected corporate risk taking in the presence of growth opportunities, represented by Tobin's q.","",""

Health care cost data were collected over two years for 260 working individuals. Multiple regression analyses were used to control for initial health care costs, age, and gender in predicting later costs; independent variables were stress, strain, social support, and their interactions. Main effects and interactions each accounted for significant proportions of the variance in various health care costs.","","Health Benefit Plans, Employee; Health Care Costs; Humans; Occupational Health; Regression Analysis; Social Support; Stress; United States; article; economics; health care cost; health insurance; human; occupational health; regression analysis; social support; stress; United States"

The firms first entered their core businesses and those in which they had a strong competitive advantage over local firms to reduce the hazard of failure. Learning from early entries enabled them to launch further entries into noncore businesses and into areas of weaker competitive advantage. The overall evidence suggests that Japanese firms are building capabilities to operate overseas through sequential entry. © 1995 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.","",""

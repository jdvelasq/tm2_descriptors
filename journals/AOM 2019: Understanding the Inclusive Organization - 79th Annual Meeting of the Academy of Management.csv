How does job autonomy influence job performance? A meta-analytic test of theoretical mechanisms,2019,AOM 2019: Understanding the Inclusive Organization - 79th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103462663&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2019.145&partnerID=40&md5=e2a26d8af3b561ffe9539b9e8b8e18ef,"We meta-analytically examined an integrative framework that links job autonomy to job performance. Results from a summary of 319 studies and 151,134 participants indicate that, overall, job autonomy led to better job performance, mainly by enhancing work motivation but also by reducing mental strain. We differentiated three dimensions of job autonomy (decision-making, method, and scheduling autonomy) and showed that theoretical mechanisms vary depending on the type of autonomy. Work motivation was most strongly enhanced by decision-making autonomy, but it was diminished by scheduling autonomy. The strain-reducing effects were stronger for decision-making autonomy and method autonomy than for scheduling autonomy. Moreover, preliminary evidence indicates that core self-evaluations mediated the effects of job autonomy dimensions on work motivation and mental strain. Together, our findings suggest the need to (a) consider multiple theoretical mechanisms and (b) differentiate among all three forms of job autonomy in order to better understand how job autonomy affects job performance. We offer practical implications for managers who seek to provide more job autonomy to their employees. © AOM 2019: Understanding the Inclusive Organization.

Fragmented elites and the short-term focus of the american corporation,2019,AOM 2019: Understanding the Inclusive Organization - 79th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094217809&partnerID=40&md5=263049ecd940244e2a448587016d13ce,"We examine how short-termism results from the dissolution of the corporate network. We argue that the board interlock network served as a collective resource that helped corporate elites to mitigate short-termism. Using three indicators of short-termism, we identify a structural basis for short-termism that links network-based resources to managers' decisions. © AOM 2019: Understanding the Inclusive Organization - 79th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management.

Understanding organizational integrity from an institutional perspective,2019,AOM 2019: Understanding the Inclusive Organization - 79th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084811367&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2019.28&partnerID=40&md5=2bf12deb27af1cec715be0f62e250f2c,"In this paper we set out to offer renewed attention to the important concept of organizational integrity and proposed an institutional perspective. We have taken a social actor conceptualization of organizations (Bromley & Powell, 2015; King et al., 2010) and integrated it with values literature (Bourne & Jenkins, 2013). We have set out to theorize on how the coherence between the values reflected in organizational talk, operational and social structures, and action may be frustrated. This work addresses a significant gap in organization studies research by spotlighting the potential negative outcomes of theoretical models and thus exploring the dark side of organizations (MacLean & Behnam, 2010). © AOM 2019.All right reserved.",,Institutional perspective; Organization studies; Social actors; Social structure

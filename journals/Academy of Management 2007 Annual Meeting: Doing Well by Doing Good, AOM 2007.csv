Auditor effectiveness and efficiency in workpaper review: The impact of regulatory focus,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858380754&partnerID=40&md5=823a30c37c776dd7bf85bead4725b789,"This study investigates the relationship between regulatory focus and auditor efficiency and effectiveness in audit workpaper review tasks. The results of a controlled experiment suggest that auditors with a promotion focus are faster than auditors with a prevention focus in terms of detecting errors in workpapers, whereas auditors with a prevention focus are more accurate than auditors with a promotion focus. In-depth analyses demonstrate that the difficulty level of errors has a moderating effect on the relationship between regulatory focus and auditor efficiency and effectiveness. While auditors with a promotion focus are faster in detecting simple surface, complex surface, and simple contextual errors, they are slower in detecting complex contextual errors than auditors with a prevention focus. In addition, we find that auditors with a prevention focus are more accurate in detecting only complex contextual errors than auditors with a promotion focus and that there are no significant differences in terms of accuracy for the other types of errors. Implications for audit workpaper reviews are discussed.",Audit review; Efficiency and effectiveness; Regulatory focus,Efficiency; Management; Complex surface; Controlled experiment; In-depth analysis; Moderating effect; Regulatory focus; Errors
The influence of consensus decision-making on intergroup trust and reciprocity,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858419469&partnerID=40&md5=0f2dfa73eac12a19f725025bab3023ef,"Employing a trust game, I examine the impact of the consensus-making process on intergroup trust and reciprocity in a strategic setting, and compare those decisions with ones made by individual decision- makers. Results show that between consensus groups a) psychological trust is lower, b) controlling for psychological trust, behavioral trust is higher, and c) reciprocity is significantly lower. I also compare consensus decisions with those made by autonomous group representatives, who are responsible for their group decisions. Results suggest that that the specific choice of the group decision-making mechanism can make a substantial difference to the decisions in the intergroup exchange.",Group decision-making; Reciprocity; Trust,Behavioral research; Group decision; Group decision-making; Reciprocity; Trust; Trust games; Decision making
Pay dispersion and top management team turnover: Additional evidence,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858379482&partnerID=40&md5=ba3f831edfc0889003e1d4c61140f6db,"Using a multi-industry longitudinal dataset of executives in publicly held firms, this study further explores the efficiency of tournament models in executive compensation. Specifically, the present study provides additional analyses of the relationship between pay dispersion and top management team (TMT) turnover. Analyses are conducted at both the TMT and individual levels. Results indicate that pay dispersion is associated with increased TMT turnover at both the team and individual levels. Additionally, findings at the individual level suggest that this effect is magnified when pay is lower relative to the market, when TMT members receive lower portions of overall TMT compensation, and when executives have more pay at risk.",Pay dispersion; Top management teams; Turnover,Data sets; Executive compensation; Top management teams; Turnover
Geographic orientation and performance of global versus regional MNEs,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858408617&partnerID=40&md5=ac906e2c22a796f06140b1aa241cf0f2,"Research on multinational enterprises (MNEs) has been preoccupied with the concept of ""global strategy"" based on the assumption that a global presence is a natural endpoint for internationalizing firms. Recent research, however, has suggested that very few global firms exist and, in fact, those MNEs that orient their business interests towards their home regions experience superior performance. We bridge the gap between these opposing viewpoints on the nature of MNE geographic orientation (i.e., global versus regionally-based MNEs) by examining the drivers that differentiate between these organizational archetypes. We argue that the liability of foreignness creates conditions under which proprietary assets and the managerial resources to deploy those assets affect an MNE's capacity to organize globally versus regionally as well as the suitability of that strategic choice. Using a large data set of MNEs, our results suggest that in low technology industries most firms tend to internationalize regionally and only those firms with a combination of strong marketing assets, extensive international experience, and focused product lines tend to take on a global orientation. MNEs in technology intensive industries, on the other hand, and especially those with the strongest technical assets, are more likely to have a global presence. Firms with a strong fit between marketing assets and geographic orientation tend to perform best.",Global strategy; Internationalization; Regional strategy,Marketing; Global strategies; International experiences; Internationalization; Large data; Managerial resources; Multinational enterprise; Product-lines; Proprietary assets; Regional strategy; Strategic choice; Technical assets; Technology industry; Industry

Increasing innovation through identity integration,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858432962&partnerID=40&md5=fdb2c3b144bcbf076676919cdfc89b57,"Innovation involves bridging existing knowledge systems from different areas. We propose that individuals who can integrate multiple social identities are better at combining knowledge systems associated with each identity, and thus exhibit higher levels of innovation. Three studies, each probing different types of social identities, provide evidence for this proposition. A laboratory experiment showed that Asian American biculturals who perceived their multiple cultural identities as compatible (high Identity Integration or high II) exhibited higher levels of innovation in creating new Asian-American recipes than biculturals who perceived their multiple cultural identities as conflicting (low Identity Integration or low II). A field study of faculty members with two disciplinary affiliations found that those who have high II (i.e., perceived the two disciplines as compatible) had more publications than those with low II. A third study showed that women engineers who have high II (i.e., perceived their gender and professional identities as compatible) were more innovative than those with low II. These findings suggest that the psychological management of multiple identities affects how individuals innovate.",Identity integration; Innovation; Knowledge bridging,Innovation; Cultural identity; Faculty members; Field studies; Knowledge bridging; Knowledge system; Laboratory experiments; Multiple identities; Professional identity; Social identity; Women engineers; Integration

Vertical disintegration and entrepreneurial opportunities: The case of broadcasting,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858380500&partnerID=40&md5=f31564a94a8446f94673c853b5db0d8f,This paper presents a model of industry evolution that addresses how vertical disintegration emerges and how vertical disintegration provides entrepreneurial opportunities. It does this by redefining the concept of a dominant design as a set of multiple design decisions that include both alternative choices about technology and the definition of sub-problems in terms of independent modules. The degree of openness in the design rules that define the interactions between these modules determines the degree of independence for these modules and thus the level of opportunities for vertical disintegration and entrepreneurs. This paper uses historical analyses of the broadcasting sector to define these vertically disintegrated layers and the rules that determine the interactions between these layers. It uses data on the number of firms and revenues in each layer to show how the emergence of independent modules and vertical disintegration has led to entrepreneurial opportunities for new entrants.,Entrepreneurship; Industry evolution; Opportunity recognition,Degree of independence; Design decisions; Design rules; Dominant design; Entrepreneurial opportunities; Entrepreneurship; Historical analysis; Industry evolution; Opportunity recognition; Sub-problems; Vertical disintegration
Debunking the ideal worker myth: Effects of temporal flexibility & family configuration on engagement,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858419112&partnerID=40&md5=fc976ee0bb6255c888da95e420e3287d,"We investigated the interactive affects of temporal flexibility and family configuration on work engagement. In contrast to ideal worker ideologies and depletion perspectives, results based on a survey methodology suggest that single workers are the least engaged in comparison to workers with other family configurations. In addition, our results suggest that episodic flexibility policies are associated with higher levels of work engagement and that the relationship between episodic flexibility and engagement is stronger for single workers. In contrast, daily flexibility policies were not significantly related to work engagement. We discuss the implications of our results for the enrichment perspective, the notion of time in organizations, and the design of temporal flexibility policies.",Engagement; Flexibility policies; Work-family,Engagement; Survey methodology; Work-family; Human resource management

We investigate how fast a set of potential inventors situated in a pre-configured interaction network innovate and how different configurations of the interaction network affect the speed of the innovation process. Small world studies have discussed the effects of realized connections in studying innovation activities. In contrast, we develop a two-phase model that stresses the distinction between potential and realized connections. Using a parameter that captures the dynamics of the potential and realized connections among actors, we find that structure connectivity has a curvilinear effect on the time to innovate in a population. Furthermore, we test the robustness of this finding under different learning ability conditions and learning mechanism settings.",Agent-Based modelling; Innovation; Social structure,Active networks; Computational methods; Innovation; Agent-based model; Agent-based modelling; Curvilinear effect; Innovation activity; Innovation process; Interaction networks; Interaction structures; Learning abilities; Learning mechanism; Small worlds; Social structure; Two-phase model; Dynamics
Organizational knowledge transfer: A meta-analytic review of its antecedents and outcomes,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858393440&partnerID=40&md5=047415331674bd9c619ea9d050bf231d,"Research on organizational knowledge transfer is burgeoning, yet our understanding of organizational antecedents and consequences remains rather unclear. Although there have been conceptual and qualitative reviews of the organizational knowledge transfer literature, no study has attempted to summarize the quantitative findings present in the large body of empirical research. By using meta-analytic techniques to summarize relationships between organizational antecedents, inter- and intraorganizational knowledge transfer, and important consequences, this study represents a first step toward that goal. We provide a more comprehensive understanding of knowledge transfer processes by uncovering how knowledge transfer processes unfold at different levels of analysis. In this sense, our study does not only reveal new insights into levers and outcomes of organizational knowledge transfer, but also provides new insights into particularities of transfer processes between organizations and between units within organizations.",External and internal cooperation; Knowledge transfer; Meta-analysis,Empirical research; Internal cooperation; Knowledge transfer; Levels of analysis; Meta-analysis; Organizational knowledge; Transfer process; Knowledge management
When do improvisational capabilities trump dynamic capabilities?,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858391264&partnerID=40&md5=740eff9ec3093b14c5c798293a2279e3,"A key question for many organizations is how to build a competitive advantage in turbulent environments by reconfiguring existing operational capabilities and building new ones that better match the environment. While the literature has stressed the role of dynamic capabilities for building new operational capabilities, developing and exercising dynamic capabilities may not always be possible, or even appropriate in highly turbulent environments. Therefore, we first introduce the notion of improvisational capabilities as an alternative strategic means for shaping operational capabilities. Improvisational capabilities are defined as the ability to spontaneously recombine resources in real time to build new operational capabilities that address novel environmental situations. Second, we develop the properties of improvisional capabilities and articulate the differences between improvisational and dynamic capabilities. Third, we compare the relative effectiveness of these capabilities in different degrees of environmental turbulence. The empirical results from the New Product Development context show that dynamic capabilities are the only significant factor in moderately turbulent environments, whereas improvisational capabilities completely take over in highly turbulent environments. Fourth, IT leveraging capability enhances both dynamic and improvisational capabilities, especially as the environment becomes more turbulent. Finally, the paper draws implications for understanding and exercising dynamic and improvisational capabilities in turbulent environments.",Dynamic capabilities; Environmental turbulence; Improvisation,Competitive advantage; Dynamic capabilities; Improvisation; New product development; Operational capabilities; Real time; Turbulent environments; Competition
A population based model of network analysis,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863350752&partnerID=40&md5=ed2472fd7448ad1b5d19d378d57050b3,"This paper proposes a population based model of network analysis. The model incorporates the concept of an organizational population into network analysis. Organizations embedded within a population collectively hoard valuable resources. Residing in the same niche, they collectively adapt to environments, but engage in incessant competition against one another. Three types of networks are identified: horizontal, vertical, and cross-institutional. Horizontal networks refer to connections among organizations within a population. An organization's status emerges within a population. Horizontal networks and status have different implications for organizational behavior and performance. Status is valuable in front stage situations, where the audience is numerous, market uncertainty is high, and connections with vertical and cross-institutional networks are pivotal. Status is effective in acquiring new resources and in expanding the boundary of the population's niche. Networks are valuable in back stage situations, where information flowing within the population is scarce and important, and resource mobilization within the population is necessary. Networks are effective in redistributing internal resources of the population to generate derivative benefits. Using the venture capital industry as an example, the paper shows that status is valuable in the process of initial public offering, whereas horizontal networks are important in the event of acquisition. Findings provide initial evidence for the population based network analysis model.",Network centrality; Status; Venture capital,Investments; Initial public offerings; Internal resources; Market uncertainty; Network analysis models; Organizational behavior; Resource mobilization; Status; Venture capital; Societies and institutions

Examining the antecedents and consequences of mentoring relationships,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863368678&partnerID=40&md5=3fb26d46d151968acea0b29f267f18ad,"Although there is a large body of research on mentoring and career success, very little is known about the antecedents and outcomes of the mentoring process. Thus, the goal of this empirical paper was to advance our knowledge of precursors to mentoring received and how mentoring received leads to career success. In particular, we addressed calls in the literature to study the effects of personality and learning in the mentoring process by proposing a model that examines the relationships among personality, mentoring, organizational learning, and career success. We surveyed a sample of 330 employees from a diverse set of occupations and found support for our theoretical model. Results indicated that individuals who scored high on proactive personality and extroversion received more mentoring. Mentoring received was subsequently related with organizational learning, which was positively associated with the numbers of promotions and subjective career success, but not with total income. We also found the two personality variables to have a direct effect on organizational learning above and beyond the effect of mentoring received. Our study provides both theoretical and practical implications for researchers interested in the mentoring process and firms with developmental programs. The present study also contributes to the career literature by examining the process through which personality variables influence career success in the context of mentoring.",Career success; Mentoring; Personality,Career success; Mentoring; Mentoring relationship; Organizational learning; Personality; Personality variables; Theoretical models; Knowledge management

Legitimation has long been considered a key element in new venture success. Yet previous theories on new venture legitimation have focused on isomorphism as the primary mechanism for legitimation. New theories on rhetoric and language provide an alternative mechanism. The use of rhetoric as a communications mechanism for shaping institutional logics enables agency instead of isomorphism as a means of legitimation. But the accessibility of particular rhetorical strategies depends on the linguistic environment, which includes the semantics of change and continuity within the socio- cultural environment and their relationship to the social identity of the new venture or the entrepreneur of the new venture. There thus exist four generic strategies available to the entrepreneur, depending on the linguistic environment and the venture or entrepreneur) s identity within the environment.

Building on in-depth studies of diagnostic problem solving in a time-pressured acute care setting, we develop a formal mathematical model of the dynamic structures that underlie four diagnostic archetypes: fixating, in which a self- reinforcing exploitation structure dominates; diagnostic vagabonding in which a self-reinforcing exploration structure dominates; stalling, in which neither exploration nor exploitation are sustained, and adapting in which structures for both exploration and exploitation are engaged in balance. We clarify the mechanisms that facilitate and prevent switching between and combining exploring diagnoses and exploiting known treatments. This analysis provides both theoretical insights into the interplay of exploration and exploitation and practical suggestions for reducing diagnostic error and enhancing diagnostic effectiveness.",Exploration & exploitation; Medical error; Modeling,Clarification; Diagnosis; Mathematical models; Models; Reinforcement; Diagnostic problem; Dynamic structure; Exploration and exploitation; In-depth study; Medical errors; Problem solving

Results also support important but different roles for managers' leadership behavior, both transformational and affect focused, in shaping employees' affective reactions to change and their subsequent behavioral responses.",Affect; Leadership; Organizational change,Human resource management; Management; Managers; Affect; Behavioral response; Federal Government agencies; Leadership; Multi-level; Organizational change; Three body; Behavioral research
Organizational diversity and museum formation: A study of american local communities 1872-1976,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863376971&partnerID=40&md5=64cb99330c16fee8d66b99963fca3d94,"Motivated by general theoretical ideas about the societal consequences of diversity among organizations, I examine how the diversity of organizational forms in a local community shapes the formation of its museums. I argue that the diversity of organizations that cut cross major community segregation lines enhances the public-spiritedness of the whole community and the community's ability to act collectively by increasing public participation and interaction of citizens with different backgrounds. In contrast, the diversity of organizations that are confined to the major segregation lines should further community cleavage and decrease the likelihood of establishing a museum to serve the community. Empirically, I investigate how diversity in the local newspaper industry, the financial service industry, and the religious arena affected the formation of museums in American counties from 1872 to 1976. I find that the diversity of general content newspapers has a positive relationship with the formation of museums, implying the integrating effects of general content newspapers that cut across boundaries of race, ethnicity, and economic strata. In contrast, there is a negative relationship between ethnic newspaper diversity and museum formation, showing the segregating effects of ethnic newspapers by race and ethnicity. Moreover, I find the diversity of financial service organizations has an unexpected negative effect on the formation of museums, demonstrating that diverse financial service organizations may segregate a community by economic strata or by geographical area. The findings show that there is no systematic relationship between the diversity of church members in a community and its museum creation. I conclude with a discussion of this study's implication for a general research program on the social, political, and economic consequences of organizational distributions in communities.",Community solidarity; Integration and segregation; Organizational diversity,Newsprint; Community solidarity; Economic consequences; Financial service; Geographical area; Local community; Local newspaper; Organizational diversity; Organizational forms; Public participation; Research programs; Societies and institutions

An integrative job demand-resource model of burnout & job performance: A meta-analytic path analysis,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858395632&partnerID=40&md5=73949c7d339ef5e0002e3523736951da,"This study examines three research questions in relation to the consequence of burnout (job performance), the antecedents of burnout (job demands and job resources), and the interrelationships among the components of burnout (emotional exhaustion-EE, depersonalization-DP, and reduced personal accomplishment-RPA). We propose competing integrative JD-R models of burnout and job performance and test them through a meta-analytic path analysis that uses meta-analytic correlations from 229 independent samples. Results of the basic meta-analysis reveal that RPA is the strongest predictor of job performance, followed by EE and DP. Results of meta-analytic path analyses demonstrate that job demands are positively correlated with EE, job resources are negatively related to DP, and both higher job demands and lack of job resources lead to RPA. The best-fitting developmental sequence of burnout is characterized as EE->DP->RPA. We discuss the implications of our findings for burnout research and practice.",Job burnout; Job performance; Meta-Analysis,Regression analysis; Job burnout; Job demands; Job performance; Meta-analysis; Path analysis; Research questions; Job satisfaction

For example, family owners' and managers' ties to one another can sometimes supersede their ties to the business and its non-family stakeholders, and thereby shape firm strategy and outcomes. To examine this thesis this paper distinguishes three basic governance regimes: family businesses (FBs) in which multiple owner- executives are related by blood, entrepreneur businesses (EBs) in which an individual entrepreneur or unrelated parties are major owners or owner-executives, and all other public firms. Family owners/executives are argued to be motivated to distribute wealth and position to other family members, keep the business in the family, and respect family interests and traditions. Thus we find family businesses to entrench their executives, pay higher dividends, avoid financial leverage, and exhibit many forms of strategic conservatism. Their total shareholder returns and growth are only average. Consistent with our thesis, these FB results are significantly conditioned by the degree of the family embeddedness of owners and managers, as reflected by their roles, status and generation. On the other hand, businesses in which unrelated entrepreneurs serve as major owners or owner-executives (EBs) are unencumbered by such family ties: they are freer to pursue business-building priorities. We find them to pay lower dividends, invest more heavily in capital projects, and accumulate resources. They outperform the market in total shareholder returns and growth, and show higher levels of market risk.",Embeddedness; Family firms,Investments; Managers; Shareholders; Capital projects; Embeddedness; Family business; Family firms; Firm strategy; Market risks; Shareholder returns; Social embeddedness; Industry

What is the most consistent justification for the association between Broad-based stock options program and firm performance? By using a unique data set containing the exact start dates of Broad-based and Executive stock options programs, this work demonstrates that Broad-based program improves firm productivity. However, the productivity premium appears one year after the adoption, suggesting attraction and retention as the possible justifications. The productivity growth path prior to adoption shows that such program is unlikely a reward for better performance or simply conveying compensation. The evidence that firm size is a significant determinant of Broad-based stock options program seems to be supportive of the monitoring cost argument. For examining the mechanisms underlying the positive association between such program and productivity, we utilize the Sales, General, and Administrative (SGA) expenses as the proxy for organization capital as suggested by Lev and Radhakrishnan (2003). We establish organization capital as the mediating variable, which confirms our hypothesis that Broadbased program impact firm productivity through improving organization capital. Nonetheless, the results suffer possible selection bias.

In this article, this phenomenon is revisited taking into account the critical difference between two types of business group networks: the horizontal type and the vertical type. Using data on the US patents granted to the largest Japanese industrial firms, the results show that there are important differences between the impacts of these two types of networks on firm innovation and global learning. First, both horizontal and vertical networks promote innovation, but in different ways. In the horizontal network, its inter-industry conglomerate character works to facilitate novel re-combinations and wider applications of knowledge across different industries; while in the vertical networks, its intra-industry supply chain nature works to facilitate integration and coordination of interdependent technologies in the manufacturing of complex multi-technology products or systems. Furthermore, horizontal networks are shown to constitute a substitute for and thus a constraint upon developing global networks for diverse knowledge access, while vertical networks do not show this negative effect on the development of global knowledge networks. Thus, it is argued that these two types of business group networks represent two distinct models of innovation networks: they each facilitate different knowledge creation and technological innovation processes, and they have different capacities to engage with and leam from more open international networks.",Global learning; Innovation; Networks,Coordination reactions; Innovation; Manufacture; Networks (circuits); Patents and inventions; Supply chains; Business groups; Firm innovation; Global knowledge; Global learning; Global networks; Innovation network; International networks; Japanese firms; Knowledge creations; Technological connection; Technological innovation process; US patents; Vertical-type; Industry

Moreover, the desegregation of constructs reveals the negative impact of institutional distance in product market and labor market regulations together with the distance in political system on subsidiary performance, whilst the impact of distance in capital market, labor market and degree of openness for foreign investors are not found to be significant.

Overcoming contextual barriers in knowledge transfer: Making the 'invisible' salient,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858437140&partnerID=40&md5=9dd604dcbb34c43cb2e6710e82664f27,"Our understanding of context and contextual knowledge is a gap in the organizational knowledge literature which has not received the attention it merits. Contextual knowledge is most prevalent in practice as all knowledge has a corresponding context which reflects why it was created, and implies how it is to be interpreted. The contextual knowledge ""trap"" occurs because individuals ignore, or are oblivious to, the context in which transferred knowledge is embedded. The consequence is that transferred knowledge which is valid and useful at the source's context may be invalid, or even worse - dysfunctional - when applied in the receiver's context. The paper makes two contributions. Primarily, it develops a theory which answers the research question: why is context often transparent to knowledge producers and consumers? We first view knowledge with an awareness and codifiability perspective to understand the issues. Second, we explain that context 'invisibility' stems from one's lack of awareness, a function of both the context's saliency and an individual's attention. Third, we posit that context saliency is negatively affected by dispersedness and availability, and positively affected by novelty. Unfortunately, novelty is diminished by those immersed in context. However, the knowledge recipient can make the context differences more salient. Together the knowledge source and recipient are can create contextual knowledge enabling them to identify context relevant to the knowledge transferred. The paper's second contribution is distinguishing between tacit and contextual knowledge. The lack of literature on contextual knowledge is partially explained by the literature's simplistic tacit / explicit dichotomy which confounds tacit and contextual knowledge.",Awareness; Context; Tacit knowledge,Awareness; Context; Contextual knowledge; Knowledge sources; Knowledge transfer; Organizational knowledge; Research questions; Tacit knowledge; Knowledge management

We examine the responses of firms to activist shareholder resolutions with a particular focus on when firms choose to engage in dialogue with stakeholder groups. Based on resolutions filed by members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility from 2002 to 2005, we find that corporate managers are more likely to engage in dialogue with shareholder activists when the issue of concern involves social justice, when the firm's size is smaller, when there are more outside directors of the corporation's board, and when corporate visibility is high.

In contrast, we propose that radical innovation requires balancing exploration and exploitation within organizational units and within different organization functions, as it encompasses both idea generation and implementation. To test this proposition we focused on the cultural value of innovation, which emphasizes exploration, idea creation, flexibility and change, and on two exploitation oriented values: attention-to-detail and outcome orientation. We suggest that the combination of a positive linear effect of innovation in combination with non-linear effects of attention-to-detail and outcome orientation, would lead to the highest level of radical innovation. Seventy organizational units belonging to a large organization participated in the study. Using CFA and HLM, we demonstrated that the three values can co-exist and be simultaneously promoted. However, lack of prioritization among the cultural values was detrimental to innovation, such that when all cultural values were high radical innovation was low.

In Study 1, survey data was used to demonstrate that Whites experienced more unearned (race-based) advantages in the workplace than did Blacks. However, Whites were less likely to report an awareness of White privilege than were Blacks. Furthermore, qualitative data analysis provided convincing support that White employees perceived that their race-based advantages were normative and available to most organizational members; whereas Blacks did not share these perceptions.

Using survey data of 505 software development projects, we tested a research model and hypotheses regarding relationships among the dimensions of software team flexibility, team autonomy, team diversity, and project performance. The results revealed a negative relationship between the two dimensions of software project team flexibility. Team response efficiency positively affected both project process performance and software functionality, whereas team response extensiveness positively impacted only software functionality. While increased team autonomy helped enhance software team response efficiency, it reduced software team response extensiveness.

Companies investing in fashionable IT in fact had lower performance in the short term, but improved performance in the long term. These results offer strong support for an institutional explanation of IT diffusion, illustrating that following fashion can legitimize organizations and their leaders even in the absence of performance improvement. The findings also extend institutional theory from its usual focus on taken-for-granted practices to transitorily fashionable innovations as a novel source of social approval.

Taking the perspective that an IT innovation concept emerges and evolves beyond organizational boundaries in a community, I contend that the prevalence of the concept, or popularity, in IT discourse positively influences the adoption of the underlying innovation. Then with the aim to explore what makes an IT innovation concept popular, my empirical analysis of the once highly popular concept ERP (enterprise resource planning) suggests that (1) the popularity of ERP was influenced positively by the prevalence of a multi-field business and social problem which ERP happened to solve; (2) ERP's popularity was influenced negatively by the prevalence of related old innovation concepts; and (3) these influences disappeared after ERP passed its peak popularity. These results imply that the popularity of an IT innovation concept responds to the broader climate of business and society and relies on the right type of attention that other concepts may draw and release in a network of concepts. Going beyond the dominant paradigm, this paper helps broaden IT innovation research along two new dimensions: toward innovation concept, as a complement to material innovation, and toward community-level analysis, as an extension of the traditional organizational analysis. The paper also suggests practitioners evaluate an innovation concept's fit with the broader environment and relationship with other popular concepts, as a way to make sense of the innovation and anticipate its impact on IT practice.",Information technology innovation; Innovation concept; Popularity,Enterprise resource planning; Innovation; Empirical analysis; Information technology innovation; IT innovation; Multi-field; New dimensions; Organizational analysis; Organizational boundaries; Popularity; Social problems; Information technology

Yet, researchers still do not have an authoritative, cumulative understanding of what causes (un)ethical decisions and behavior in organizational settings. In this meta-analysis, we draw from multiple literatures and resources to answer questions about the who, when, and where of unethical choices. Our findings show that individuals higher in cognitive moral development, lower in Machiavellianism, with a more internal locus of control, a less relativistic moral philosophy, and higher job satisfaction are less likely to plan and enact such choices. When issues involve high moral intensity such choices are also suppressed. Where organizations have benevolent climates, strong ethical cultures, and (enforced) codes of conduct, fewer unethical choices occur. Intriguingly, most of these influences are stronger for behavior than intention, suggesting a non-conscious or intuitive path for (un)ethical decisions that has seen much less investigation in the behavioral ethics literature. These results and ideas should serve as a databased foundation for the behavioral ethics field as well as a guide to organizations who want to do well by doing good.",Ethical decision making; Individual behavior; Meta-analysis,Decision making; Job satisfaction; Academic research; Business ethics; Ethical culture; Ethical decision making; Individual behavior; Locus of control; Meta-analysis; Moral development; Moral philosophy; Organizational setting; Philosophical aspects

We argue that perceived vulnerability, which is shaped by technological, market, and institutional conditions, has an effect on trust and distrust that subsequently leads into a feedback cycle involving also control, active trust investment, and perceived trustworthiness. Our study connects institutional organization theory with intra-organizational issues of trust and control.

Individuals were then randomly selected from those groups such that none, one, three, or all five members of the group participated in training on effective ways to select a job candidate. The extent to which the knowledge acquired by one or more individuals was used by the group in making a selection decision was evaluated. Vertical transfer occurred according to a negatively accelerating curve. As the number of people trained increased beyond three, the amount of influence exerted by the fifth individual decreased.

The aim of this paper is to fill this void and to determine what constitutes an optimal network structure for exploration and exploitation within the context of technological innovation. We differentiate among a firm's direct ties, indirect ties and degree of redundancy and analyze their role in the pharmaceutical, chemical and automotive industry. Regarding the role of direct ties, in combination with indirect ties, we find two alternative alliance network structures that are effective for both exploitation and exploration. We also find that redundancy in the alliance network has a positive effect on exploitation. However, there is no relation between redundancy and exploration, which seems to point to a new insight regarding the role of network redundancy in case of exploration of new technological fields. A final point is that our findings remain largely invariant across the three industries, enhancing the generalizability of our results.",Alliance networks; Exploitation; Exploration; Technological innovation,Chemical analysis; Natural resources exploration; Redundancy; Technology transfer; Exploitation; Exploitation and explorations; Exploration and exploitation; Network redundancy; Network structures; Optimal network structure; Technological innovation; Technology alliance; Technology-based; Structural optimization

The matter of how trust affects performance is addressed by examining three teamwork behaviors - team effort, team monitoring, and team reflexivity - as potential mechanisms that transmit the effects of trust to team performance. The matter of what team performance dimensions are affected is addressed by distinguishing between two team performance dimensions - team effectiveness and team efficiency - and exploring possible differential relations with trust and the teamwork behaviors studied. The results from our study of ongoing teams suggest that teamwork behaviors provide substantive interpretations of the ways in which the effects of trust are transmitted to team effectiveness. The results also suggest differential effects of trust and teamwork behaviors across team performance dimensions. Finally, our results suggest that the way trust operates in ongoing organizational teams may be different from the way it operates in the temporary teams of students often studied by trust researchers with respect to the form and nature of these relations.",Team performance; Teamwork; Trust,Differential effect; Potential mechanism; Team effectiveness; Team performance; Teamwork; Trust; Work team; Management

Furthermore, we find that this negative effect is significantly greater in areas with high levels of technological activity. The results remain robust to variations in samples and specification methods, and hold both in firm-level and patent-level analyses. Finally, the economic implication of this age effect appears to be substantial.

Results of a four-wave, 31/2-year longitudinal survey study of 567 young musicians suggest that participants' calling was shaped by their ongoing behavioral involvement and social encouragement in the calling domain. Counter to expectations, level of ability was not a significant predictor of calling; neither were demographic characteristics.

Our empirical results show that the capital market reacts negatively to institution-based information asymmetry in international acquisitions. This negative reaction is more significant for inexperienced acquirers and firms making unrelated acquisitions. In addition, when information institutions are poor, firms choosing partial acquisitions perform better than those choosing full acquisitions. Overall, this study contributes to the information asymmetry theory by bridging macro institutional contexts with micro firm- and transaction-level factors, thus providing a more comprehensive analysis for the information problems involved in international acquisitions.",Information asymmetry; Institutions; International acquisitions,Factor analysis; Risk management; Societies and institutions; Adverse selection; Capital markets; Comprehensive analysis; Information asymmetry; Institutional economics; Market performance; Significant impacts; Mergers and acquisitions

We develop a dynamic model in which two platforms with different network quality compete under indirect network effects. Our results indicate that indirect network effects dominate quality effect in determining the long-run market structure. When the strength of the indirect network effects is above a certain threshold, the market converges to a monopoly; a platform can improve its chance of dominating the market by increasing its network quality. When the strength is below the threshold, the market converges to an oligopoly; a platform with better network quality will always be the market leader. While it is well known that strong indirect network effects drive monopoly in the literature, our finding that under weak indirect network effects, a new platform could seize a significant market share even without superior quality is new and provides different managerial implications. We empirically analyze the competition between Xbox and PlayStation 2 consoles in the video game industry. We find game players and developers do not perceive significant quality difference between the two consoles.

A majority of the respondents viewed lack of awareness, time constraints, and low levels of supervisory support as important barriers to accessing the career center program. While users of the program reported that career center staff provided good service, program users also reported that they did not thoroughly review resource materials. Although both users and nonusers viewed the program as an important demonstration of management's commitment to employee development, higher ratings of managerial commitment were associated with center usage. Additionally, program users have significantly higher career insight and resilience than nonusers.

A taxonomy of hospital governing boards,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863356969&partnerID=40&md5=b0418eb0c03c470b80f40eb300814f97,"The purpose of this study was to develop an empirical taxonomy of governing boards in U.S. community hospitals. The taxonomy was developed using a configurational perspective and with cluster analysis according to three main areas of board responsibility-mission and strategy setting, performance evaluation and oversight, and external relations. Results of the cluster analysis were validated using ANOVA tests and discriminant analysis and were reviewed by industry experts. In a sample of 1334 community hospitals, a 5-cluster solution was identified. Assessment of the agreement between slip-half subsamples using Kappa statistic suggested that the cluster solution had high internal reliability (Kappa=0.87; p<0.0001). ANOVA tests using the entire study sample showed that the inter-cluster variance was statistically significant on the three board functions. Based on discriminant analysis, 97.5% of the hospital governing boards were determined to be correctly classified through cluster analysis, suggesting high internal validity. Systematic differences were found between clusters in terms of hospital and environmental conditions. While it is recognized that a clear goal of hospital governing boards is to build and sustain an effective hospital, our findings indicate that what boards actually do to accomplish that goal differs substantially. As the function and performance of hospital governing boards continue to receive attention, the taxonomy developed in this study would provide policy-makers, healthcareexecutives, and researchers a useful way to describe and understand the role of hospital governing boards.

Learning during and after internationalization by entrepreneurial firms from emerging economies,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858394504&partnerID=40&md5=fa69d092c7e38d01c4cefdc773e525e0,"We develop and test a model that explains how entrepreneurial firms from emerging markets leam the entire internationalization process and not simply before or immediately post entry. Using a sample of 216 firms from China, India and South Africa, we show that age at international entry and commitment of resources to international entry have inverted U-shape relationships with firm growth while the acquisition of network ties and proprietary technology have positive linear ones. The findings suggest that successful internationalization is not a discrete process; rather, it is a continuous effort through which entrepreneurial firms build knowledge over time taking advantage of diverse learning opportunities.",Entrepreneurship; International; Learning,Emerging economies; Emerging markets; Entrepreneurial firms; Entrepreneurship; Firm growth; International; Learning; Learning opportunity; Network tie; Proprietary technologies; South Africa; Industry

Although researchers in marketing and management have investigated power and relationship commitment issues within and between organizations, few have examined their impact on SCI. This paper studies the relationship between power, relationship commitment and integration between manufacturers and their customers within a supply chain. The impact of customers' SCI on the customer service and financial performance of manufacturers is also investigated. We propose and empirically test the SCI model using data collected from 617 manufacturing companies in China. The reliability and validity of the measurement instruments used in this study are also tested empirically. The results show that customers' use of different types of power has different impacts on manufacturers' relationship commitment. Expert power, referent power and reward power is very important in improving manufacturers' normative relationship commitment, while reward power and coercive power enhance instrumental relationship commitment. We also find that normative relationship commitment has a greater impact on customer integration and customer service by manufacturers than instrumental relationship commitment. Customer integration significantly enhanced manufacturers' customer service and financial performance. The improvement in customer service of manufacturers positively influenced their financial performance.",China; Power; Supply chain management,Customer satisfaction; Integration; Sales; Supply chain management; China; Customer services; Financial performance; Manufacturing companies; Measurement instruments; Power; Reliability and validity; Supply-chain integration; Manufacture

Despite many anecdotal stories about these small businesses, some reporting extraordinary successes, such as the Hope Group (Peng, 2001), others describing alarming of violations of labor laws, such as with sweat shops (Roberts & Engardio, 2006), there have been very few theoretical or empirical studies that focus on the HR practices they employ in China. The current study uses a qualitative method to investigate those actual practices related to HR that have been implemented by small firms. Institutional theory, stakeholder theory and resource-based view are borrowed to analyze the context of the business environment of these small businesses and to frame research questions. Fifteen small firm owners in a medium-sized city in the northern part of China were interviewed, the data analyzed and a grid model developed. Results show that five firms out often in the interviewed sample are implementing quite advanced HR practices; three other firms use little or no HR efforts; the rest range in between. Some Western HR practices are in evidence, but most of the HR practices used by these small firms were developed by the owners themselves, based upon strong indigenous Chinese characteristics.

We develop a multi-dimensional measure of VC prestige and use a sample of over 600 VC- backed IPOs conducted between 1990 and 2000 to test our hypotheses. The results of our analysis suggest that VCs provide both substantive and symbolic benefits, especially those VCs that become involved early in the IPO firm's development.

The study explored the associations among a physician]]s emotional intelligence, patient trust, and the patient-physician by using tri-angular and multi-level approaches. Nine hundred and ninety-four outpatients and 39 physicians representing 11 specialties were surveyed. Results indicated these was no significant association between the patientjjs rating of trust and the physician jjs self-rated emotional intelligence, but there was a significant association between the patientjjs rating of trust and the physicianj|s emotional intelligence as rated by the nursing director (r = -.301, p <.001) and senior staff (r = -.301, p < .001). Results of structural equation analysis indicated that composite emotional intelligence of physicians (r=.93, p < 0.01), ratio of outpatient number in the specialty (r=.19, p < 0.10), and ratio of follow-up patients ((r=. 56, p <.0.05), had positive effects on patient trust. Patient trust had a positive impact on the patient-physician relationships (/O = .65, p <. 0.01), which modulated the effect of trust on patient satisfaction (/O = .95, p <.001). The final model proved to be valid (chi square/df = 26.46/28, p =0.55), showing a sound fit (GFI = 0.91 and RMSEA = 0.001). The model explained 37% of the variance of trust, 48% of patient-physician relationships and 56% satisfaction.

While prior research has focused on state regulation's effect on firm behavior, this paper focuses on organizational factors that influence the regulatory decision-making process. Using the approval of new drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as my context, I argue that the FDA's historical evolution as an arbiter of science infused the agency with values that focus the agency's attention on specific types of signals. In particular, I contend that firm status in the knowledge domain becomes salient as the FDA attempts to resolve the uncertainty in determining drug quality. Furthermore, I propose that innovation strategies and external shocks generating uncertainty enact the FDA's scientific identity to a greater degree, rendering a firm's status in the knowledge domain even more valuable. Using the review times for 1,303 New Drug Applications (NDAs) approved by the FDA between 1990 and 2004, I find that firms with higher knowledge status receive faster approval of their drugs, with roughly a one and a half month advantage for a top 13% firm over an average firm. The benefits of being a high status actor were further enhanced when firms attempted to do radical innovation, but status had limited effects when the regulator suffered from a legitimacy crisis. Additionally, status signals of product specific competencies were less influential in expediting drug review than a firm's overall position in more broader and basic areas of knowledge. The paper concludes with a discussion of the contributions to organizational theory and the practical implications for innovative strategies of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms.",Institutions; Regulation; Status,Societies and institutions; Food and Drug Administration; Historical evolutions; Innovative strategies; New drug applications; Organizational factors; Organizational theory; Regulation; Status; Decision making

Because of their size, scope, and complexity, the meaning of these newly dominant entities remained unformed to most of the American public. Management, wrote Peter Drucker in 1954, ""is the least known and the least understood of our basic institutions."" Most people viewed ""management"" as ""little more than euphemism for 'the boss.'"" The popular culture of the 1950s helped fill that void in understanding. Motion pictures in particular invited viewers to peak behind the closed doors of the executive suites. Between 1954 and 1960, a number of movies dealt with the complex new phenomenon of life within the giant corporation. Although produced with the goal of appealing to a large audience, motion pictures also reflected the social, political, and cultural context of the time. In particular, these movies appeared as the motion picture industry responded to the pervasive Cold War ideology that took root in the postwar years, and the public worked to reconcile a lingering distrust of big business with a newly found acceptance of and admiration for the potential for contribution for large corporations. A cycle of corporate movies produced varied between wide-eyed acceptance and exaltation of big business (Woman's World and Sabrina, for instance) and dead-end cynicism about the possibilities that giant conglomerates might offer (The Apartment). Rod Serling's Patterns occupied a complex middle space, reflecting both the possibilities and the anxieties of an economy dominated by giant corporations. This paper will examine the content of those corporate movies, with special attention to Patterns, as a way of experiencing and understanding the complex public response to the complexity of this new, dominant economic reality.",1950s; Business history; Motion pictures,Military operations; 1950s; Basic Institution; Business history; Cold wars; Cultural context; Popular cultures; World war II; Motion pictures

Both forms of behavior are affected by policies and procedures which establish norms and expectations, yet rarely are these behaviors measured in real time. Rather, destructive and constructive deviance are often captured using self-report methodology which raises several red flags, including validity concerns, inability to assess causal relationships, and a focus on the negative to the exclusion of the positive. This field experiment focused on capturing deviance behavior in a simulated work environment, using norms prescribed for employees as the benchmark for evaluating deviance. Two hundred twenty-five individuals were employed in a one-time work opportunity where real time behavioral observations of deviance were measured. Results revealed that behavioral observations provide a valid assessment of deviance behavior, with relationships between withholding effort, performance, destructive behavior, and constructive behavior in the expected direction.

Under high actor-specific uncertainty, status and affiliation to high status actors signal the perceived quality. This certification affects resource flows, which in turn increases the actual quality and the excess performance. On the other hand, status might change actors' exposure to market uncertainty, even though it cann UNCERTA1 affect the market uncertainty itself. Therefore, once the level of exposure is controlled, the relationship between status and performance should not be moderated by the actors' exposure to market uncertainty. I test my hypotheses on the venture capital (VC) industry and find that the effect of status on VC fund's performance increases as the exposure to actor-specific uncertainty increases. On the other hand, the effect of status on the fund's performance does not change with the fund's exposure to the market uncertainty. My findings imply that investors and entrepreneurs should prefer to work with high status VC firms to gain higher returns. Furthermore, VCs can improve their performance by extending their ties and, hence, attaining more prestigious positions in the syndicate networks.",Network; Status; Venture capital,Commerce; Networks (circuits); Market uncertainty; Perceived quality; Resource flows; Status; Venture Capital; Investments

Specifically, we explore how the movement of employees between competitors and potential cooperators (in client-supplier relationships) affects the external social capital shared by focal firms with specific clients. In addition, we argue that losing employees to competitors will generally be more deleterious to the performance of firms relative to employee turnover to other destinations. We test our theories with a unique dataset of patent attorney movements between patent law firms and Fortune 500 companies, and examine how employee mobility of different types influences law firm performance. Our results show that when a focal law firm either hires attorneys from and/or loses attorneys to a Fortune 500 company, this increases the amount of future business the law firm receives from that client. Gaining employees from competing law firms that have a client relationship with a company has a positive influence on future business from that client, and losing attorneys to any competitor has a negative influence on law firm performance. Our findings suggest that human resource research may benefit from utilizing social capital arguments to examine the effects of different types of employee mobility on firm performance.",Legal services; Mobility; Social capital,Carrier mobility; Laws and legislation; Patents and inventions; Personnel; Statistical tests; Client relationships; Employee mobility; Employee turnover; Inter-organizational; Legal services; Resource-based view; Social capitals; Supplier relationships; Economic and social effects

Previous studies have shown that diversity has contradicting effects, improving the amount of information available while degrading social integration. Most studies assume these opposed effects to mix in an additive way, leading to a neutral prediction. However, considering that such effects occur exclusively of one another leads one to hypothesize that diversity has a U-shaped effect on variance of performance. Empirically, a reanalysis of a business simulation with 35 separate teams confirms such effects for three demographic and two cognitive diversity variables. Furthermore, when constraints on performance exist, combining mean and variance analysis leads to improved predictions that contradict predictions based on the mean analysis only. The findings matter for organizational contexts that reward or punish extreme outcomes- therefore risk-providing, for instance, new insights for research in entrepreneurship, high-reliability organizations and population ecology.",Risk; Team diversity,Risks; Amount of information; Business simulation; Cognitive diversity; High reliability organizations; Organizational context; Performance outcome; Social integrations; Team diversity; Forecasting

Using hierarchical regression models to test hypotheses, our results indicate that inefficient institutions encourage firms to seek networking relationships with other firms, especially if they are smaller in size. Additionally, networking activities of firms with other firms as well as with government officials are significantly related to the level of restructuring efforts that are undertaken by firms in these transition economies. Young and private firms are especially more likely to leverage their networking relationship with other firms in order to undertake restructuring initiatives. The results are discussed with respect to future research requirements in these transition economies.",,Environmental regulations; Regression analysis; Changing business environment; Eurasia; Government officials; Hierarchical regression models; Institutional theory; Restructuring efforts; Transition economy; Laws and legislation

Studies of exits from the profession at the early credentialing stage have identified failures in forming a professional identity as an engineer to be the most consequential reason for exit - exceeding measures of performance and ability, and that cultivating an engineer identity is more difficult for women than for men. Policy recommendations addressing this disparity must be informed by an understanding of the mechanisms of professional identity formation, and how they may be gendered. Theories of role identity formation from both the macro and micro perspectives emphasize the importance of social interactions, but are ambiguous regarding the causal role of peers. This paper uses a quasi-experimental design, in the form of assigned roommates, to investigate the role of peer influence on identity formation among men and women engineering students. I find both a causal role for peers in professional identity formation and that peer influence is gendered, being less influential for women than for men.

We also find that firms could overcome system dependence by either investing in generating common ground across locations to coordinate over interdependence. However, our findings indicate that investing in modularity or in facilitating ongoing communication across locations does not lead to coordination across geographic distance.

A total of 768 workers from 45 different organizations participated in the study. The results of the moderated regression analyses showed that the effect of leader social support on the stressor-strain relationship depended on source congruence. Whereas we found a reverse buffering effect for leader support on the role conflict-strain relationship we found favorable buffering effects for leader support on the physical stressors-strain relationship. These differential buffering effects did not emerge when considering co-worker support.

This paper argues that incorporating the process of customers using a technology provides a better explanation of the shifts in competition within an industry than prevailing evolutionary models do. This paper asserts that an industry's shift to cost-based competition depends upon customers converging on a more standardized use of the technology and that the competitive significance of a discontinuous technological change is not determined until its use characteristics are established.

Given the many advantages that may accrue to groups who are confident, it would be logical to advise groups to build a strong sense of collective efficacy as early as possible. However, drawing on Whyte's (1998) theory of collective efficacy and groupthink, we argue that when confidence emerges toward the begining of a group's existence, group members may be less likely to engage in productive conflicts that are necessary to function effectively.

In this paper the role of one such factor, tradition, is considered in order to provide some insight on the difficulties of collaborative processes. The role of tradition in collaboration is considered in connection with knowledge, in relation to two established areas of extant research. Firstly, a body of work addressing tradition and knowledge describes the persistence of tradition as a basis for interpretation and thus its connection with the constitution of knowledge. Secondly, established literature focussed upon collaboration and knowledge conceptualizes interorganizational collaborations as sites of potentially conflicting understandings and interpretations of knowledge. However, there is no extant research that investigates the overlaps and linkages between these two areas. It is this gap that the current paper addresses, through qualitative research in three collaborative situations; insights about the modes of carriage of tradition in knowledge, in collaborative contexts, are derived and implications for the process of collaboration are discussed.",Collaboration; Knowledge; Tradition,Collaboration; Collaborative process; Interorganizational collaboration; Knowledge; Qualitative research; Tradition

However, replication, as a strategy for exploiting firm knowledge assets is problematic as repeated exploitation may lead to competency traps, organizational inertia, and an inability to adapt critical knowledge to changing environmental conditions. Many firms that compete through replication, however, appear to be vibrant over long periods of time suggesting that mechanisms for change, even in the face of intense exploitation, may exist. This paper addresses the problem by asking two questions-to what extent do we observe variation in firms that compete through replication and what are the sources of that variation. The sample includes monthly indicators of variation in fundamental routines for a census of all U.S. units of a large franchise organization in the service sector over an 11 year period operating. We describe the data by partitioning variation into center led, inter-temporal, within-unit, inter-temporal, and between-unit, geographic variation and using Hierarchical Linear Modeling to test for a variety of potential antecedents.",Exploitation; Replication; Variation,Competition; Competitive advantage; Environmental conditions; Exploitation; Geographic variation; Hierarchical linear modeling; Organizational inertia; Replication; Variation; Knowledge management

Moreover, we find that consultants have a positive impact on a measure of firm financial performance, but no impact on a more comprehensive composite measure of performance. Finally, post hoc analyses show that while the effectiveness of outside consulting assistance depends on the individual consulting firm, it is not necessarily a function of the consulting firm's cumulative experience of similar engagements.",,Banking industry; Environmental complexity; Financial performance; Firm Performance; Influential factors; Measure of performance; Regulatory change; Start-up process

For many firms, because of the difficulty in imitating them, the most important knowledge assets are those embedded in organizational routines. And a growing body of scholarship suggests that competitive advantage is directly related to a firm's ability to leverage that knowledge by replicating it throughout the firm. One of the critical considerations in replication is the effect of adaptation on the performance of transferred routines. A long standing tradition in a variety of literatures suggests that transferred assets in general should be adapted as soon as possible to increase fit with the local environment. More recent research on replication, however, suggests that adaptation may have negative side effects with fit with the original template and fit within a system of units with similar routines also important considerations. This paper addresses two moderating factors, extent and timing of adaptation, which may offer a rapprochement. To test these effects we utilize a unique dataset involving monthly performance data and two types of adaptation indicators, the addition of new routines and the modification of existing ones, for a majority of the U.S. units (approx. 3,500) of a large non-food franchisor over an 11 year period. Utilizing panel data methods we test for the significance of both moderators and measure the effect of different levels of adaptation versus a baseline of non-adaptation over time. The analyses indicate strong effects for both extent and timing of adaptation.",Adaptation; Panel data; Replication,Competition; Statistical tests; Timing circuits; Adaptation; Competitive advantage; Local environments; Moderating factors; Negative side effects; Panel data; Recent researches; Replication; Knowledge management

Specifically, we examine how firm size and bank organizational structure influence knowledge and thereby influence a firm's access to credit. Findings suggest that firm size is positively associated with a bank's knowledge about a firm, while the degree of a bank's mechanistic structure is negatively associated with a bank's knowledge about a firm.

Our paper is principally an in-depth case study of the subjectivities of men who were serving, or who had served, in an elite military unit - the British Parachute Regiment. In examining issues of agency and control in identity matters we employ literature on subjectivity, the discursive construction of identity, the self as a project, and identity regulation. There is a dearth of research in management studies on military institutions, and one important element of the research contribution of this paper is to explore issues of subjectivity and identity regulation in these under-explored work organizations. Two aspects of our case are particularly highlighted. First, we argue that soldiers' evolving self-conceptions were disciplined not (just) by anxieties but by understandings of themselves as professionally tough, and their continuous aspiration to be more authentic paratroopers. Second, rather than focus on how those who were hierarchically privileged sought to manipulate discursive resources for their own ends, we examine a range of paratroopers, to illustrate how all (officers and enlisted men) were subject to, and constituted by, the material and discursive practices of the Regiment.",Discourse; Identity; Military,Discourse; Identity; Material resources; Military; Military units; Work organization; Parachutes

Adaptation proceeds by incremental organizational changes that either improve or worsen an organizations fit to its environment. Studies in this line of research often show organizations as prone to competency traps from which they are unable to exit. We posit that given such suboptimality, it is in the evolutionary advantage of organizations adaptively to evolve a capability that, though limited, can avoid deadend traps. This capability is the categorization of knowledge which permits a firm to be 'neutral' to small fitness changes that result from incremental change. We employ the concept of neutrality into an NK model of adaptive search. Organizations engaged in neutral search achieve better performance outcomes compared to those that do not, and benefit from higher survival chances. These results indicate that inertia has adaptive value, explaining why curtailing entrepreneurship may be in an organization's interest.",Categorization; Innovation; Knowledge,Adaptive search; Adaptive value; Categorization; Incremental changes; Knowledge; Organizational change; Performance outcome; Suboptimality

However, the specific ways in which similarity and distinctiveness influence categorical understandings, and thus market behavior, remain theoretically underspecified. In this paper, we advance knowledge of the cognitive processes underlying market evolution by investigating the impact of these two properties on a core determinant of the vitality of categories-new entries by producers. We propose that similarity and distinctiveness work in discrete ways to guide entry rates. Similarity of producers within a category allows for the development of clear categorical understandings, facilitating coordination and mobilization of the resources necessary for organizing. Distinctiveness, by contrast, increases the salience of a category vis-à-vis other producers, helping categories to attract attention from market participants. For both properties, we propose threshold effects such that very high levels of similarity and distinctiveness work to depress entry rates. We find support for our propositions using data on the entry of U.S. production companies into feature film genres during the period 1914-1970.",Entry; Film industry; Organizational categories,Motion pictures; Cognitive process; Entry; Film industry; Fundamental properties; Market participants; Organizational categories; Organizational literature; Production companies; Commerce

Referring to calls for more extensive reflections about motivations for cheating costs and benefits of academic honesty versus misconduct in this context are analyzed.

The research was guided by a theoretical framework that begins with a model underpinning many large-scale job stress investigations - the job strain model (JSM) - and is expanded to incorporate psychological contract breach and organizational fairness theory. The results of hierarchical regression analyses from both studies confirm the value of the JSM. There was also strong support for extending the JSM to include the breach and fairness variables.

We argue by contrast that, in markets with high information asymmetry, the returns to brokerage may actually increase over time. We use fieldwork and quantitative data from the staffing sector to examine how the duration of the relationship between market brokers and the brokered parties, as well as between the brokered parties themselves, affects the returns to brokerage. We test our hypotheses using information on relationships, bill rates, and margins from a broker in this market - a specialized temporary help agency. Our results show that long term relationships between the agency and the workers (i.e., the ""brokered party"") increase both bill rate and percentage commission. Long term ties between the worker and the client firms, however, reduce the bill rate and commission. These findings demonstrate the importance of long-term relationships in brokerage, and have more general implications for the understanding of how positional advantages are sustained over time.",Brokerage; Relationships; Rents,Commerce; Brokerage; Client firms; Economic advantages; Information asymmetry; Long-term relationships; Quantitative data; Relationships; Rents; Personnel selection

And how do we conceptually grasp the linkage between ongoing actions on the micro level and institutions usually regarded as macro-level phenomena? This article claims that these challenges cannot be resolved without overcoming the ontological struggle that lies behind them: the struggle between holism and individualism. It is the general purpose of this article to raise the awareness for an alternative approach towards institutional change which is grounded on practice theories. Practice theories are a promising means in that they generally aim at overcoming the ontological struggle. Their contribution to a processual and balanced account of institutional change is discussed with reference to selected praxeological concepts of structuration theory that has been neglected so far.

To that end, we identify four characteristics common across different entrepreneurial setting (i.e., information asymmetries, weak patents, limited wealth, and optimism) and discuss their effect on two popular entrepreneurial actions. These actions are (a) exposure of the invention (Disclosure), or (b) a Contingent Payment Scheme (CPS) offer (e.g., royalty based license, deferral of pay). Outsiders infer invention's quality indirectly from entrepreneur's CPS choice, or asses it directly by inspecting disclosed information. Because wary outsiders cannot inspect the invention when presented with a CPS, they discount the valuation in lieu of potential entrepreneurial optimism. Disclosure, hence, might offer higher valuation. But once information is disclosed, the outsider has in effect acquired the invention without cost. Disclosure, thus, is costly due to weak patents and potential imitation. Using a formal model that allows for clear definitions and parsimonious analysis of each action's costs and benefits, we then answer the opening question.",Entrepreneurship; Resource acquisition; Signaling,Cost benefit analysis; Patents and inventions; Signaling; Contingent payments; Costs and benefits; Economic theories; Entrepreneurial action; Entrepreneurship; Information asymmetry; Real-world practice; Resource acquisition; Economics

Using the example of an environmental CMS we propose that contrary to the predictions of signaling theory plants with poor environmental performance adopt a CMS. These plants are however superior performers when compared to other plants within multi-plant firms.

Agrarian societies based on chattel slavery relied on an extensive corps of supervisors and devoted considerable effort to discourse surrounding the management of unfree labor. Following Bendix, we seek to understand management theories in these societies as ideologies, rooted in ideas that justify the authority of landowners and defend their organizations against legitimacy crises. Based on a systematic review of documents from Roman and Southern writers, we argue that the distinctive political challenges in each historical case led to divergent management ideologies, despite a common economic basis in agricultural enterprise employing gang-system slave labor. In the late Roman Republic and early empire, management ideology confronted challenges to large-scale landownership and absentee landlords. In the antebellum South following the Nat Turner revolt, management thinkers staved off threats from abolitionism and Northern political activists. We conclude by asking why the managerial belief systems in these agrarian societies have largely been ignored by subsequent organizational scholars, including research on the history of management.",Authority; Ideology; Management history,Administrative theories; Agricultural enterprise; Archival materials; Authority; Ideology; Industrial societies; Management history; Political activists

The second driver is the realization of client-based scope economies through cross-selling. I analyze a unique longitudinal data set from the UK corporate legal market that comprises the client relationships of the largest UK law firms with FTSE 250 corporations, experts' assessment of law firms' capabilities, and law firms' profitability. I find that superior expertise relative to direct competitors and cross-selling, both by a focal firm and by its competitors, are important drivers of supplier profitability and client relationship stability. Moreover, cross-selling appears to be an important source of differentiation that also has a direct impact on competitors' ability to capture value.

In turn, organizational scholars face a stark choice: Say something useful to practitioners using narrative stories in which dramatic effects are achieved at the expense of academic rigor or maintain academic integrity by sacrificing practitioner relevance. Organization science needs find a way to study extremes more rigorously. For a new perspective, we turn to an emerging new physics expressly aimed at dealing with complexity dynamics. Econophysics is the name given to the application of this new physics to economic problems. It incorporates biological concepts of organization, ones in which organization becomes an attribute of the elements of a group or aggregation in interaction-an emergent property of the aggregation's internal connectivity. The paper draws on a different method of understanding and dealing with complex phenomena. It distinguishes between the old simplicity of reductionism, equations, linearity and predictions of old physics, and the new simplicity of insignificant initiating ""butterfly-events""-nonlinearity, similar causal dynamics at multiple levels, power laws, and scale-free theory. Cognitive representations of the real-world and follow-on creation of response schema are shifted from Gaussian simplicity to Paretian simplicity. Organizational schema formation and adaptation within the Gaussian and Paretian ontologies are framed in terms of adaptive responses subject to Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety. We show how the variety perceived to be requisite is sensitive to the type of ontological assumptions that are made and examine how this affects an agent's social information processing strategies and schema formation. An organization science based on researching scale-free dynamics and fractal structures is outlined.",Econophysics; Extremes; Power laws,Ontology; Academic integrity; Econophysicss; Extremes; Fractal structures; Internal connectivity; Organization science; Power-law; Social information processing; Dynamics

Combining theories of industry evolution with transaction cost theory, we empirical investigate three possible impacts of the industry lifecycle on firm's vertical integration choices. First, we hypothesize that the emergence of a dominant design is associated with vertical disintegration because of the standardization of components that dominant designs tend to promote. Second, we posit that firms selling at higher price points, because they are attempting to differentiate their products by incorporating unique components, will tend to be more vertically integrated than their lower-price rivals. Finally, we hypothesize that firms with more early production experience, because they tend to develop superior production capability relative to suppliers, will tend to be more vertically integrated into components. We find evidence for all three effects in data from the early U.S. auto industry.

This ontological theorization borrows insights from critical realism and post-structuralism to explore general features of rules. For instance: they under-determine fields of legitimate actions, are prone to logical stratification, are anchored to desires and are inherently open to interpretation, though in a discursively structured way. Moreover, I propose that a rule is social if and only if it is internally related to a social relation. In turn, this helps to clarify and systematize an understanding of how social rules relate to social positions and identities. The objectives of this paper are two-fold. Firstly, I initiate a dialogue with authors writing on rules from a realist perspective, in particular John Searle and Tony Lawson.

A theoretical explanation of this relationship, termed the informational distinctiveness and accessibility hypothesis, is investigated. It is proposed that OCBs, due to their discretionary nature, are more likely than task behaviors to be attributed to internal causes making them more accessible in memory, leading to increased weighting of OCBs in appraisal decisions. Three laboratory experiments were conducted to test these hypotheses, and results confirm that OCBs appear to be more informationally distinct and accessible than task behaviors. Implications for the performance appraisal and organizational citizenship behavior literatures are discussed.",OCB; Performance appraisals,Behavioral research; Decision making; Decision making process; Internal cause; Laboratory experiments; Managerial decision; Managerial performance; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Performance appraisal; Managers

A transitional period is empirically examined by comparing investment levels 2 years pre-SuperNet and 3 years post-SuperNet. The data indicate an increase in real private investment expenditure among larger SuperNet communities. This indicates the Internet spurs entrepreneurial activities by enabling agglomeration across areas with a pre-existing (pre-SuperNet) cluster of entrepreneurial activities. However, there was a decrease in investment among smaller SuperNet communities with fewer than 10,000 residents. As well, among more geographically remote communities (more than 150 kilometers from a major city), there was a decrease in investment among SuperNet communities with less than 30,000 residents. This indicates that for small rural communities, the Internet enables consumption of items and services not produced within the local community (and typically produced at a lower cost than that which is possible in the local community), and discourages entrepreneurial activities among communities that lack a pre-existing (pre-SuperNet) entrepreneurial cluster. Overall, the data are consistent with the view that virtual entrepreneurial clusters are not independent of real entrepreneurial clusters.",,"Investments; Regional planning; Alberta , Canada; Broadband Internet; Entrepreneurial activity; Private investment; Regional economic development; Remote communities; Rural community; Transitional period; Economics"

This paper redirects attention to an opposite condition in which a unique class of agents-knowledge agents-enjoys heightened levels of autonomy and displays opportunistic conduct albeit under information symmetry. Using a random sample of 54 U.S. research universities and 23,394 scientists, we show how some scientists violate their employment contract when they privately appropriation rent from discoveries they made while working for their institutions. That is, some scientists opt not to license their discoveries through their technology licensing offices (TLOs) and instead privately take their discoveries directly to the market- misappropriate. We find that misappropriation increases with more valuable discoveries and heightened entrepreneurial activities on university campuses. Highly autonomous TLOs and royalty sharing with departments are associated with reduced misappropriation. Taken together, our study-and a stylized mathematical model-suggest that agency theory should better account for conditions in which principals have the information and authority to sanction their agents but instead chose to absorb substantial costs stemming from agents' opportunistic behavior.",Agency; Misappropriation; Technology commercialization,Crime; Agency; Entrepreneurial activity; Information asymmetry; Information symmetries; Misappropriation; Research universities; Technology commercializations; Technology licensing offices; Autonomous agents
How do capabilities emerge and why do some firms develop them while others do not?,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088753594&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2007.26518296&partnerID=40&md5=57fab47c8f7904534e543cdade8b46aa,"While much research suggests that capabilities are critical for firm performance, surprisingly little is known about how capabilities emerge. Using an inductive research logic and in-depth nested case studies, we explore how executives develop a capability. Specifically, we study how executives develop an internationalization capability. The setting is ten entrepreneurial firms with headquarters in three culturally distinct countries (i.e., Finland, United States, Singapore). Results show that capabilities begin as leaders seed experience with a sense of urgency. Urgency, in turn, fosters a self-reinforcing pattern of connected experiences over time since it biases managerial preferences towards lower risk options. Firms that did not develop capabilities had no urgency to start and had random, unconnected experiences. Capabilities further unfold through mere exposure. Frequent formal and informal communication among headquarters and country operations facilitates positive affect leading to greater pro-social behavior and increased incentives for the sharing of best practices. In contrast, infrequent communication leads to negative affect, lack of trust, and an increased probability of knowledge suppression. Finally, capabilities develop from organizational resilience, where paradoxically change is fueled by stability. Overall, we attempt to provide a more relevant and accurate view of how capabilities come to exist. Instead of promoting a conception of capabilities as a simple function of luck or more experience this study sheds light on the specific types and combinations of mechanisms firms use to generate capabilities. In doing so, this study helps to open the ""black box"" of capability creation and thus helps fill a significant gap in the literature.",Capability; Internationalization; Strategic process,Capability; Entrepreneurial firms; Firm Performance; Informal communication; Internationalization; Positive affects; Self reinforcing; Strategic process

The key is that these firms have a better understanding of their primary stakeholders' utility functions, which provides them with an enhanced ability to recognize value-creating opportunities.

The negotiation transcripts of 124 American and East Asian negotiators (62 dyads) were coded for joint sequencing of integrative behaviors as well as sequencing of cooperative relationship management behaviors. CQ measured a week prior to negotiations, and aggregated to the dyad level, predicted the extent to which negotiators sequenced integrative behaviors, which in turn predicted joint profit. CQ predicted integrative sequences over and beyond international experience, openness to experience, extraversion, empathy, cognitive ability and emotional intelligence. Exploratory analyses revealed that this effect was largely driven by the motivational facet of CQ. Furthermore, the minimum CQ score within the dyad was enough to predict integrative sequences, showing that the extent to which negotiation processes can be improved is limited to the lowest ability negotiator.",Cultural intelligence; Intercultural negotiation; Strategic sequences,Cooperative relationships; Cultural intelligence; Exploratory analysis; Intercultural negotiation; International experiences; Negotiation process; Practical importance; Strategic sequences; Emotional intelligence

Traditionally, these NEOs have relied on models of decision making based in IT or offline services in isolation, but these approaches may not provide the insight required to truly predict consumers' intentions toward a specific firm. This research integrates IT and services re-search to develop and test a comprehensive model of consumer decision making online.

The data is analyzed using the panel data method that provides a more robust test of the model as it corrects for problems associ-ated with omitted variables.

The multi-business group is comprised of each individual general manager of the firm's business-units. Because these general managers exercise significant control and authority of their business-unit resources, their individual and collective actions can have significant firm consequences - positive or negative. Accordingly, business-unit general managers can be a unit of internal firm governance and source of strategic action. Yet, despite the significance of this particular executive management group, we know little about them. Moreover, we have little direct understanding of the structures, processes, or psychosocial characteristics of the multi-business group specifically or executive management teams, like top-management-teams, generally - as indicated by the continual calls for more in-depth observational studies of top-management-teams. This study begins to address these gaps in the literature. The result is theory that describes the association between characteristics of the multi-business group and its association with significant firm outcomes. When the multi-business group operates as a team, higher firm performance is the result and when they do not, the result is lower firm performance. This study thus contributes theory related to executive management teams, such as top-management teams and multi-business groups, and introduces a detailed description of the multibusiness group to the literature.",Case study research; Managment groups; Multi-business organization,Managers; Case study research; Collective action; Executive management; Firm Performance; Managment; Multi-business organizations; Observational study; Top management teams; Human resource management

However, managers ultimately pursue such renewal opportunities, and the discretion of managers varies across industries. We suggest that industries where managers have greater latitude for action are better able to respond to the pressures and opportunities for pursuing strategic renewal through both internal and external venturing.

However, this framework neglects the possibility for technological interdependence between components that can affect these choices and lead firms to make joint decisions for multiple components. Using resource-based theories, we explore this overlooked area by investigating how firms source technologically interdependent components and test our predictions by exploiting a rich dataset that includes sourcing choices several components, including pairs that are interdependent and those that are unrelated. We expand the range of choices from a make/buy dichotomy to a trichotomy that includes concurrent sourcing, which arises when firm simultaneously make and buy a given component. We find that firms tend to source technologically interdependent components via the same mode and that firm, intrafirm, and interfirm expertise tend to influence the choice of mode. Most strikingly, firms concurrently source technologically interdependent components when there is the opportunity to leverage the combined expertise of the firm and its suppliers. By contrast, expertise has little influence on common sourcing decisions of technologically unrelated components.",Resource based view; Sourcing; Technology,Individual components; Inter-dependent components; Joint decisions; Multiple components; Resource-based theory; Resource-based view; Sourcing; Statistical tests

In this paper we address these symmetric weaknesses in the organizational literature on networks consequences and antecedents by specifying dynamic models for the joint representation of network selection and influence processes. We estimate our models using a set of longitudinal data that we have collected on a sample of graduate students enrolled in a professional management degree. We report clear evidence of influence on individual performance of a variety of network motifs defined over interpersonal relations of advice seeking and contribution to individual learning. Controlling for a variety of different sources of homophily (like, for example, age and gender) and for a number of endogenous local network effects (like, for example, transitivity and reciprocity) we find that performance of individual subjects tends to be assimilated to the performance of others who contribute to their learning and from whom they seek advice. We also find evidence in support of our contention that models accounting for the co-evolution of network structures and individual behavior are statistically more informative than models that specify these two processes separately. Finally we document how individual performance is both the outcome of local network-based processes as well as a basis for social selection in the advice network, but not in the contribution to learning network.",Coevolution; Network motifs; Social networks,Social networking (online); Co-evolution; Individual behavior; Individual learning; Individual performance; Interpersonal relations; Network motif; Organizational literature; Professional management; Students

We argue that while many organizations today pursue multiple and interrelated changes, existing change theories present change as isolated events and processes in the organization. As a consequence, some of our most common intervention models insufficiently reflect the challenges that organizations that pursue multiple changes meet. Based on a study of the Norwegian financial sector, which has gone through dramatic changes in the last fifteen years, we show that the main challenges in organizations that pursue multiple changes are not related to mobilizing for change, but rather attending to daily operations while continuously implementing changes. Compared to traditional prescriptions such as Lewin's unfreeze-move-refreeze or Weick and Quinn's freeze-rebalance- unfreeze, we propose five change management techniques which span beyond isolated and single change perspectives and which contradicts some of the more common prescriptions for change management.",Change management; Multiple changes; Strategic change implementation,Change management; Change theory; Financial sectors; Intervention models; Multiple changes; Strategic change implementations

These disruptive innovations have been shown to have potentially devastating consequences for organizations and professions that fail to respond to the threats posed. Theorists have proposed that organizations and professions actually do see disruptive innovations and appreciate their threats, but find it difficult to respond because of their dependence on key resource providers, such as major customers or clients. But this may not always be the case: sometimes decision makers may not see the disruption coming at all, or they may completely dismiss the threat. This paper proposes that sometimes groupthink draws decision makers away from seeing and responding to disruptive innovations. It does this by examining one of the greatest military catastrophes in history: France's sudden and utter defeat at the start of World War II. The groupthink phenomenon has potential to augment explanations of disruptive innovation and change by showing how the leadership of an organization or profession may fail to consider alternative technological paths and solutions to problems.",Disruptive innovation; Groupthink; History,History; Military operations; Decision makers; Disruptive innovations; Established firms; Groupthink; Key resources; Professional fields; World war II; Decision making

We aim to answer two related questions. First, does interpersonal affect modify the use of task competence as a criterion for the formation of instrumental ties? Second, does negative affect influence the role of task competence in instrumental relationships differently than positive affect? Based on a methodology drawing from social psychological models of interpersonal perception and hierarchical Bayesian models for social network analysis, we investigated these questions with data from three network studies of an entrepreneurial computer technology company, staff personnel at an academic institution, and employees in a large information technology corporation. Across all the organizational contexts and tasks we analyzed, we found that, in the presence of negative affect, competence was largely irrelevant as a criterion for the formation of instrumental ties. By contrast, under conditions of positive affect, increases in task competence had a consistently positive effect on the likelihood of work interaction. We conclude that, by changing how people seek out and access the competence of their colleagues, the structure of interpersonal affect has pervasive consequences for the functioning of organizations.",Affect; Interpersonal relationships; Networks,Bayesian networks; Networks (circuits); Personnel; Academic institutions; Affect; Computer technology; Hierarchical Bayesian models; Instrumental action; Interpersonal relationship; Organizational context; Psychological model; Social sciences computing

The evidence suggests that new ventures rarely follow the classic stages model of venture growth. Instead, they conform to a modified version of punctuated equilibrium where the elements of the charter exist in stable misalignment before going through a period of upheaval to another stable, but misaligned, configuration. The research provides insights into new venture evolution, the theory of organizational charters, and punctuated equilibrium perspectives on organizational change.",Charters; Evolution; New ventures,Charters; Evolution; New ventures; Organizational change; Punctuated equilibrium; Shared understanding; Technology ventures; Technology-based

In this paper we extend existing research on attributions for group performance by describing the factors that shift the focus from attributions to the group as a whole to a focus on the unique contributions made by each individual in the group. We propose that people will explain the causes of group performance differently depending on where they stand on the cultural dimensions of individualism- collectivism and power distance.

We draw from theory and research on interpersonal influence and social exchange to suggest how the disclosure of negative firm information such as unexpectedly low corporate earnings may prompt top executives to engage in social influence tactics toward security analysts in the form of personal and professional favor-doing, and we consider how executive favors may prompt analysts to reciprocate by issuing relatively positive ratings of the firm. We also extend our theoretical framework to suggest how a relatively negative analyst rating (i.e., downgrade) may prompt executives to engage in negative reciprocity or retaliation against the analyst, and how such negative reciprocity could deter other analysts from issuing negative ratings of the focal firm. Specifically, we propose that analysts who downgrade a firm's stock may tend to receive less personal access to the firm's top executives, and that analysts who are aware of a colleague's loss of access to executives after downgrading a firm will be less likely subsequently to downgrade that firm. We test our theory with original large-sample survey data on interpersonal relations between managers and analysts combined with archival data on analyst stock recommendations, and the findings are supportive. Given that analyst recommendations have a significant influence on investor behavior, firm reputation and access to capital, our theory and supportive findings ultimately suggest how corporate leaders can enhance and perpetuate external support for their firms by engaging in social influence and exchange processes toward a key external constituent of the firm. We also discuss implications for the literatures on financial market behavior and corporate control.",Corporate governance; Social influence; Top management,Managers; Network security; Corporate control; Corporate governance; Corporate managers; Interpersonal influences; Interpersonal relations; Social influence; Theoretical framework; Top management; Economic and social effects

Thus, mimickers created more value and then claimed most of that additional value for themselves, though not at the expense of their opponents. In Study 2, mimicry facilitated negotiators!) Eability to uncover underlying compatible interests and increased the likelihood of obtaining a deal in a negotiation where a prima facie solution was not possible.

Whether organizations indeed behave chaotic in their scale and scope activities in the scientific sense of the term - though unpredictable, but still deterministic - has remained unexplored so far. Based on a longitudinal analysis of the scale and scope activities of eight German multi-business firms within turbulent and non-turbulent industries, the paper thus explores whether firms competing in turbulent environments show truly chaotic or random patterns in their scale and scope activities and whether firms in non-turbulent environments display predictable stable or periodic patterns in their scale and scope activities. Moreover, the study investigates whether firms which adjust the temporal pattern of their scale and scope activities to the degree of turbulence and dynamic of their industry in fact outperform those firms which fail to do so. Results show that not only firms in turbulent but also firms in non-turbulent environments display random patterns in their scale and scope activities. Counterintuitively, we even find that firms with random patterns in non-turbulent industries outperform those with stable/periodic patterns.

To examine the association betweefi measures of hospital safety culture and hospital performance on selected indicators of patient safety. Data Sources. Primary data from a 38-item, 2004- 2005 survey of hospital personnel, and secondary data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases from 2000, the 2002 American Hospital Association's Annual Survey of Hospitals. Study Design. Cross-sectional study of 47 hospitals to assess the relationship between safety culture and 14 hospital-level patient safety indicators (PSIs). Data Collection. Regressions with PSIs as dependent variables and hospital safety climate scores and controls as independent variables. Some specifications included individual, work unit, and organizational safety climate dimensions. Others included separate measures for senior managers and front line personnel's and for physicians and nurses' perceptions of safety culture. Principal Findings. Dimensions of safety climate that measured individual beliefs exhibited significant, positive relationships with PSIs. However, work unit and organizational dimensions, and a composite measure of safety climate across all dimensions, did not. Perceptions of front line personnel, but not senior managers, exhibited a relationship with PSIs. Where nurses reported less fear of blame, hospitals had lower rates of PSIs overall and of nurse-sensitive PSIs. Conclusions.

It develops and tests an integrated model of utilization and its correlates in public sector organizations. The analysis is based on a recent survey of public administrators (n=540) in two countries-Oman and Saudi Arabia. The study findings expose a significant, and largely ignored, problem in the development and management of public sector organizations: ""human capital resource underutilization"", indicating that skills and abilities of public administrators, although relatively and increasingly abundant, are invariably underutilized. The results show that competence utilization is closely related to certain organizational practices, namely power-influence sharing in decision making, area of expertise-job content matching, qualification-job requirements matching, and the use of work-teams. Effective utilization results in increasing job satisfaction, worker's retention, and effectiveness and quality of decisions. To date little research has successfully addressed these theoretical arguments especially in public sector organizations. The study has profound implications for organizational development and reform. Without effective mechanisms to activate and utilize human capital resources, additional skill development might prove ineffective and largely irrelevant to performance improvements and overall effectiveness of governance system.",Human capital development and uitilization; Participative decision making; Satisfaction,Decision making; Job satisfaction; Human capital development; Human capital development and uitilization; Human capital resources; Organizational development; Organizational practices; Participative decision makings; Public sector organization; Satisfaction; Human resource management

Second, we present a meta-analysis of the correlates of the most commonly used measure of engagement, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES; Schaufeli, Salanova, Gonzalez-Roma, & Bakker, 2002). Meta-analytic results show that the three factors of engagement (i.e. vigor, dedication, and absorption) are strongly inter-correlated.

Recent work emphasizes that in order to maintain its competitive advantage, a firm should be able to balance exploration and exploitation. But few works analyze how firms do it. We developed an in-depth case study. The company we studied, a large multidivisional automotive supplier, wanted to enhance its growth through innovation and so created a unit dedicated to the development of radical innovations. Taking an ethnographic approach we outlined the tensions that developed between this exploratory entity and the other divisions and focused on the integration mechanisms through which the firm outcomes these tensions. We suggest that integration takes place on a multilevel basis: the top management that appoint and support the leader of the exploratory unit, the leader that develop formal and informal interactions with the divisions' senior executives, the divisions' VPs and senior executives and the middle level managers that are in the divisions and that participate in the projects of the exploration entity. Our analysis shows four types of integration mechanisms: permanent cross-divisional working groups, ad hoc cross-divisional committee meetings, assigning transversal subjects to a high status actor and the initiatives of key individuals working both for the entity and a division.",Ambidextrous organization; Multidivisional firm; Radical innovation,Competition; Ambidextrous organizations; Ethnographic approaches; Informal interactions; Integration mechanisms; Multidivisional firm; Multidivisional organizations; Multilevel integration; Radical innovation; Integration

We show that talented entrepreneurial scientists are more likely to enter prior to a dramatic technological shift, and talented business entrepreneurs are less likely to enter. Ventures founded after a technological shift are worth more, but have lower success rates. We find opposing results of capabilities on venture value and performance.

We also expect more experienced acquirers to be able to overcome the likely resistance of powerful employees more easily. Using survey responses from 190 North American and European acquirers of as many as 253 targets located in 27 different countries, we find support for the effects of stakeholder rights and experience on some post-acquisition dynamics and outcomes.

In light of qualitative evidence on the role of programmers in promoting OSS, we focus on the attitudes of employed IT professionals towards corporate OSS engagement. Our analysis is based on 25 interviews and a large-scale survey with 404 participants, performed at the telecommunications department of a multinational company and guided by the theoretical frameworks of Rogers (innovation diffusion) and Davis (Technology Acceptance Model). Our main findings concern the impact of the respondent's job function. They are consistent with theoretical considerations - and still rather surprising. Distinguishing between developers, testers, architects, project managers, and managers, we find that software testers are generally most favorable towards heightening OSS activities, followed by software architects and managers. Apart from project managers, developers are actually least favorable towards increased corporate OSS engagement, despite their large experience in working on OSS. Since developers constitute both the basic level of software development and the largest of the named groups, this finding leads us to question that OSS is a generally supported grassroots movement. Introducing OSS and open innovation processes to a corporation thus requires taking each individual's incentives based on her job function into account, and a close look at organizational aspects.",Adoption; Open innovation; Open source software,Managers; Open systems; Software architecture; Software design; Surveys; Adoption; Adoption and diffusion; Innovation diffusion; Multi-national companies; Open innovation; Organizational aspects; Technology acceptance model; Theoretical framework; Open source software
Does money cost too much?

To raise the large amounts of capital required for continued growtfi, R&D-intensive start-ups must often turn to initial public offerings (IPOs). Yet, these transactions are not simply short-term events that infuse capital into firms, but instead delineate distinct stages in the evolution of high-tech ventures, and may subsequently shape the very innovative activities they are funding. Recent work has characterized IPOs as ""transformational"" events likely to trigger significant changes in core organizational features. Few empirical papers, however, have examined the effects of going public on firms' long-term operating processes. This study investigates whether and how going public affects firms' innovative activities. I propose that an IPO fundamentally reshapes a firm's internal operations, and consider implications for the firm's overall rate of innovation and its innovation search strategies. Using longitudinal data on 770 venture capital-backed U.S. medical device firms receiving their first rounds of funding between 1980 and 2005,1 find that a firm's overall rate of innovation increases after the firm goes public. Going public also increases the proportion of innovative search that exploits internally developed knowledge and the rate of exploratory innovation building on public-sector knowledge. I use inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights to account for self-selection into IPO and the presence of time-dependent confounders; estimates represent population average treatment effects.",,Average treatment effects; Corporate research; Critical component; High technology firms; Initial public offerings; Innovative activities; Internal operations; Long-term operating process; Investments

Temporality of the mobilisation process encountered by the institutional entrepreneur,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087223201&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2007.26530523&partnerID=40&md5=bb981d082e9f5e77dfb6e95fc70f0b83,"In institutional theories, interaction patterns studied are essentially already set and few studies really succeed in capturing the complexity of the activities that the institutional entrepreneur must manage in order to stabilise relationships and align actors. This article aims to fill in this missing gap by unveiling the micro-processes of the mobilisation process carried out by an institutional entrepreneur. If the question of how a new institution is created - which entails legitimacy building, and allies' mobilisation and discourse usage to carry the message - has been raised using a large array of perspectives, what has not yet been dealt with is the temporality of the process. Based on an in depth case study of an institution in the making, we consider, as Amis et al. (2004), the temporality, the pace and the sequence of the mobilisation process carried out with the aim to create a new institution. We study a multi-level case which involves actors at different geographical, organisational and cognitive levels. Only Aldrich and Fiol (1994) strive to explore the temporality of a new industry until its institutionalisation is taken as anchorage to legitimacy-building issues. The entrepreneur needs to cross different worlds/levels; in each, a specific component of legitimacy is built and allows passage to the next level. In contrast, our findings suggest that the mobilisation process is neither linear nor sequential: it is made up of iterations and reaches different levels simultaneously. At least this is what a statistical analysis combining themes of the presentations and affiliation of the audience leads us to conclude. The first conclusion is that the institutional entrepreneur's work entails enrolling heterogeneous actors in three different spheres. These are different, but complementary to Aldrich and Fiol's one (1994): we also try to go beyond a simple internal/external presentation of the mobilisation process and found three levels: a global network (strategic), a local network (operational) and the larger environment. This is to say that audiences can not be characterised in advance. The institutional entrepreneur navigates between the three spheres and constitutes the essential link between the three. An important conclusion to draw from this categorization is the fact that in the early phase of the mobilisation process, the new institution is promoted essentially from and for the outside world.",Institutional entrepreneur; Mobilisation process; Temporality,Cognitive levels; Institutional entrepreneur; Institutional theory; Institutionalisation; Interaction pattern; Mobilisation; Specific component; Temporality

Firms from countries with weaker corporate governance regimes can internationalize their legal (but not necessarily operational) presence by cross-listing their securities on overseas financial markets. They can ""bond"" with legal systems and enforcement policies in foreign corporate governance regimes providing stronger investor protection. Cross-listing to bond increases firm value by decreasing corporate misconduct, broadening the investor base, and lowering the cost of capital. We document evidence of cross-listing to bond with stronger legal systems and rule of law by more than 700 firms from 23 emerging-market countries cross-listing their securities on US financial markets from 1996-2002. We find that: 1) US cross-listing levels are lower for firms from Common Law countries providing stronger investor protection, but only in Common Law countries with weaker rule of law; and 2) US cross-listing levels are higher for firms from Civil Law countries providing weaker investor protection, but only in Civil Law countries with stronger rule of law. Emerging-market firms exhibit behavior consistent with bonding hypothesis considerations and cross-list as a commitment to a more rigorous corporate governance regime, but the behavior is contingent and depends on examination of both legal system and rule of law effects individually and in interaction. Our empirical results highlight the importance of broadening investigating of firm internationalization to consider legal dimensions.

Results from a multi-wave survey of individuals working virtually with others support the hypothesized model and validate the proposed impacts of collaborative technology support on individual learning processes. This research greatly advances our understanding of how individuals employ collaborative technology in a multi-dimensional way, and how doing so positively impacts their ability to integrate and apply knowledge toward complex tasks.",,Cognitive complexity; Collaborative technologies; Individual learning process; Multi dimensional; Organizational boundaries; Virtual collaboration; Virtual communication; Virtual contexts; Virtual reality

To test this hypothesis experimentally, university students were threatened by a rival institution (Study 1), and Democrats and Republicans were threatened by exposure to a leading Presidential candidate from the opposing political party (Study 2). Results provided support for the notion that high group status produces dominance under conditions of intergroup threat.

Study 2 found that whereas affirming traits that were irrelevant to an earlier poor decision reduced escalation, affirming decision-relevant traits ironically increased escalation. Finally, Study 3 demonstrated that whereas high self-esteem was associated with reduced escalation when primed following a poor decision, high self-esteem increased escalation when primed before making a poor decision. Across three studies, using three instantiations of self-affirmations and two measures of escalation, our results highlight the benefits and costs of using self-affirmation as a vehicle to de-escalate commitment; affirmations can either reduce self-justification needs by mobilizing resources for maintaining self-integrity or increase self-justification needs by highlighting self-standards that are not being met.",Escalation of commitment; Motivated cognition; Self-affirmation,Benefits and costs; Escalation of commitments; Hidden costs; Motivated cognition; Self esteem; Self-affirmation

We also find that IT capabilities generally enhance alliance performance, yet the performance impact of IT capabilities also depends upon alliance scope and task analyzability. We discuss the implications of these findings for the boundaries between the contractual and competence perspectives and suggest that task analyzability plays an important role in determining these boundaries for inter-organizational relationships.",Alliance scope; Information technology; Strategic alliances,Information technology; Alliance performance; Alliance scope; Inter-organizational relationships; IT Capabilities; Performance impact; Strategic alliance; Technology transfer

The study analyses the rationale of venture capital syndication. It is based on the 2715 syndications carried out by venture capital investors in the US in 2003. The study challenges the mainstream in finance theory that explains syndication as a tool of risk management. By using the distinction between uncertainty and risk, the study points out that the contract of the first round of funding is used to socially embedded the relationship between investors and entrepreneurs in order to initiate a ""learning by collaborating"" process. Inside information owned by the primary investor is used as a gift to initiate reciprocal exchange by inviting other investors in syndication to fund following rounds.

Under these conditions, the use of western-style signals may lead to consequences opposite to those desired. We test our propositions about the prevalence of deceptive mimicry in weak governance systems by looking at the characteristics of Russians banks that received foreign loans prior to the August 1998 financial crisis and the subsequent survival of the banks following the crisis. We show that Western investors relied on western-style signals to make investment decisions before the crisis, but it was exactly the banks that displayed these signals that were more likely to fail afterwards.",International; Mimicry; Transition economies,Commerce; Banking industry; Financial crisis; Foreign investors; Governance systems; International; Investment decisions; Mimicry; Transition economy; Investments

Under the extension heading, we further clarify the sense in which idiosyncratic resources can be the economic basis of sustained profitability in long run equilibrium - even when that equilibrium is one that might be characterized in an economics textbook as purely competitive. We point out, however, that durable profitability based in sustained advantage is not the ultimate objective that firm owners and managers should want to pursue (and strategy scholars should want to study). Rather, they should be primarily interested in what happens to the wealth of the owners. Wealth creation, however, cannot be assessed in strictly in static or short-run terms. An intertemporal analysis is required because valuable idiosyncratic resources are typically the result of investments, and such investments are often widely separated in time from the quasi-rent streams that constitute their returns. We support and illustrate these arguments by exploring a model that is a simple Marshallian representation of competition in an evolving industry. The main themes are familiar ones of evolutionary economics; profits drive growth and more efficient firms drive out less efficient ones; imitation may permit the inefficient to become efficient. Our model departs from textbook economics in one key respect, but thereby converges with the ""resource based view"" (RBV) in strategic management: We posit not only that firms differ, but that this heterogeneity centrally involves idiosyncratic firm resources that are not simply the inputs that are available in the market. Rather, generic inputs are purchased in the market and are turned into resources specialized to the firm by virtue of sunk investments in a costly process of customization. Profits emerge (as a function of capability heterogeneity), and grow or erode over time as the industry evolves. We compute model trajectories under a wide range of conditions, and assess effects on wealth creation (as measured by net present value) as well as sustained profitability. We show that the relative importance of one-off customizing investments directly affects the ability to sustain profits, as well as to the extent to which firms of differential efficiency can co-exist in equilibrium. We also show that sustainable profits may be a relatively limited part of total industry wealth creation, and that adjustment paths of industry evolution affect both NPV and the equilibrium profits in a sector.",Strategy; Sustainable advantage; Wealth creation,Commerce; Competition; Investments; Strategic planning; Textbooks; Differential efficiency; Equilibrium profits; Evolutionary Economics; Inter-temporal analysis; Strategic management; Strategy; Sustainable advantage; Wealth creation; Profitability

However, this view is incomplete because it fails to account for the fact that debt is heterogeneous, with some forms pre-committing to future courses of action while others retain the discretion to make intendedly rational and wise decisions in the future as conditions unfold. Viewing the heterogeneity 01 debt through the complementary lenses of the economic theory of rules versus discretion and the sociological theory of embeddedness suggests, quite paradoxically, that retaining the discretion to 'act optimally' in the future (as opposed to pre-committing to courses of action) can induce suboptimal outcomes. Specifically, the retention of lender discretion erodes one of the most noted governance properties of debt: its ability to discipline growth.

The concept of an organizational field highlights the fact that the differences between home and host contexts are not uniform across entire business systems, and allows for a more fine-grained analysis of institutional distance.

This study also sought administrators' perceptions of their own institution's ability to design and deliver a relevant MBA. Relying on an empirically derived competency model from incumbent managers (N = 8,633), results showed that the majority of business school curricula adequately covers key managerial competency requirements. However, across 373 schools, competencies indicated by managers to be most critical (i.e., managing human capital and managing strategy & innovation) are the very competencies least represented in MBA curricula. Findings also indicate that the more closely aligned an institution's curricula with managerial competencies, the more likely administrators are to report significant pressures to change or revise their curricula to actually be less relevant to managerial reality.

We argue that there exists a form of firm-based knowledge, which we term firm-explicit human capital, that is, in fact, transferable to competing firms, and that these firms will be willing to pay a premium to obtain it. Using a sample of over 9,000 executives, we show that executives switching to competing firms received increases to base pay greater than non-movers and those moving within or between industries. We suggest these increases are reflective of the differential value associated with various forms of executive- level human capital and we discuss the implications of our findings for future human capital research.",Executive labor market; Human capital; Job mobility,Commerce; Competing firms; Critical resources; Executive labor markets; Human capitals; Job mobilities; Specific human capitals; Personnel

Existing research on emotions at work provides some clues but ignores the role of relational context. Drawing on attachment theory, the present research investigated a model suggesting that employees hold differing relational models of their supervisory relationship in conjunction with global relational models that they bring with them to the workplace. Together, these relational models are associated with different perceptions and interpretations of supervisor behaviour, which in turn are associated with differences in emotional reactions. This framework was used to guide critical incident-style interviews with 24 nurses employed in a UK NHS Trust. Findings were broadly consistent the proposed framework and previous emotions research in non-supervisory contexts. The research highlights that in order to understand why negative emotions occur in supervisory relationships it is important to consider affective events occurring within the relationship as embedded within a historical relational context.",,Affective events; Critical incidents; Emotional reactions; Management relationship; Relational Model; Behavioral research

We address these shortcomings and the broader debate on market processes with an ethnographic study of risk arbitrage. Arbitrageurs, we find, operate in an environment of Knightian uncertainty. They overcome their limited knowledge of the future through a social and material mechanism of ""distributed calculation"" that includes establishing social, cognitive, and technological associations to frame and debate with others about a future that is unknown. Our study adds to economic sociology by detailing how calculation itself is social, even in a exceptionally quantitative environment such as an equity derivatives trading room.",,Behavioral finance; Distributed calculation; Economic knowledge; Ethnographic study; Knightian uncertainty; Mediating roles; Social interactions; Commerce

We contend that because affect-for example, feeling of sympathy, guilt and gratitude-can motivate cooperation independently from trust, it is only through the joint examination of affect and trust that we can reconcile conflicting perspectives and understand the unique role of trust in cooperative endeavors. This paper proposes an affective model of trust and cooperation that seeks to disentangle affect from trust and explicate the cognitive, motivational, and behavioral paths through which general affect and specific emotions influence both trust and cooperation. By arguing that trust is only a partial mediator of the impact of affect on cooperation, we attempt to provide the missing variable that begins to explain when and why scholars who contend trust is irrelevant are likely to make this assertion..",Affect and emotion; Cooperation; Trust,Affect and emotion; Affective model; Co-operative exchange; Cooperation; Organizational theory; Trust

No research efforts have been conducted to detect and understand the underlying dynamical patterns (i.e., the general boundaries and tendencies) which offers insights on the overall developmental motors (i.e., the general causal mechanisms) in organizations. The paper analyzes the resource allocation patterns of global multi-business firms which differ in their forms of organizing (de-/centralization) and their environmental context (high/low turbulence) within a coherent strategic period. Mathematical and stochastic modeling tools are used to differentiate between stable, periodic, chaotic, pure random and coloured noise patterns. Results indicate deterministic patterns of resource allocation for centralized organizations and random patterns for decentralized organizations as well as a higher complexity with increasing environmental turbulence. Based on theory and these results, different developmental motors are identified (i.e. teleological, evolutionary, life-cycle, and dialectical motor) which account for the detected dynamical patterns. Knowledge of these patterns and their developmental motors improves our understanding of resource allocation in organizations and offers insights for corporate level managers on how to align strategy approaches, organizational structures, and resource allocation within different environments.",Complexity theory; Developmental motors; Dynamical patterns,Life cycle; Stochastic systems; Turbulence; Complexity theory; Deterministic patterns; Developmental motors; Dynamical pattern; Environmental contexts; Environmental turbulences; Formation process; Organizational structures; Resource allocation

To this end, we develop the idea that firms exist for a multitude of reasons, depending on the particular institutional perspective taken, but if one is to explain heterogeneous firm performance, these reasons can be reduced to one explanation of firm existence: that firms predominantly exist to satisfy the payment demands of their owners.

Results from two laboratory studies confirm our hypothesis that giving the receiver control over communication timing can benefit the receiver. However, such a design can negatively impact the communication sender because of delayed response and unanswered messages. The studies advance previous work by showing how visibility of sender's task state and a common social identity affect communication decisions. Our results show that receiver's use information about the sender's relative information needs in prioritizing communication for response, and prioritize senders with a common social identity regardless of how busy they are when communication arrives.",Computer-mediated communication; Computer-supported cooperative work; Multitasking,Computer supported cooperative work; Message passing; Multitasking; Communication interaction; Computer mediated communication; Delayed response; Instant messaging; Knowledge organization; Laboratory studies; Relative information; Sender and receivers; Cooperative communication

It also is widely accepted that when conditions exist to isolate a firm's resources and capabilities from imitation, advantages associated with these factors may translate into sustained differences in performance. Given the importance of these assumptions, it is surprising how little empirical research exists on these topics. Instead, the fragmented empirical work often investigates how resources and/or capabilities increase or decrease performance or survival chances rather than how these factors contribute to enduring and systematic performance differences among close rivals (Hoopes et al, 2003; exceptions, Villalonga, 2004; Roberts & Dowling, 2002). This paper offers empirical evidence regarding the association between a firm's capability-enabling resource stocks and persistent differences in the superior performance and innovation activity of firms competing in the global semiconductor industry between 1990 -1999. Our analysis finds that innovation activity is associated with persistent above average firm profits. We also compare the durability of different resource stocks to understand which stocks might assist a firm in sustaining its lead in innovation activity relative to industry competitors. We find that advantages associated with a firm's patent stock and with the experience held by a firm's partners erode at a faster rate than advantages associated with a firm's cumulative production experience.",Competitive heterogeneity; Innovation; Resources,Durability; Semiconductor device manufacture; Competitive heterogeneity; Cumulative production; Empirical research; Firm Performance; Innovation activity; Resources; Resources and capabilities; Semiconductor industry; Patents and inventions
Organizational routines as alliance capabilities: The missing link,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085783037&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2007.26524121&partnerID=40&md5=dffd699db8dbd1cc80e8350fc540af05,"Strategic alliances continue to increase in popularity. However, a large number of such alliances are deemed to be unsuccessful. Interestingly, the success of strategic alliances differs considerably between firms. Thus, organizational factors seem to be responsible for the observed performance heterogeneity. Extant research on organizational level antecedents of alliance performance has mainly focused on factors such as alliance experience and alliance structures, with diverging results. Building on the literature on dynamic capabilities and learning curve effects, this study proposes that alliance capability, composed of alliance management routines, is a key mediator of the performance impact of both alliance experience and alliance structures. Based on survey data from 302 firms, the research model is tested using structural equation modeling. The results demonstrate a valid measurement of a five-dimensional model of alliance capability, manifested in the routines of inter-organizational coordination, alliance portfolio coordination, inter-organizational learning, alliance proactiveness, and alliance adaptation. In addition, there is evidence of a mediating effect of the alliance capability construct. We conclude that failure to include alliance management routines may lead to an imprecise understanding of the performance impact of alliance experience and alliance structures.",Alliances; Dynamic capabilities; Mediation,Enterprise resource management; Alliances; Dynamic capabilities; Inter-organizational coordinations; Inter-organizational learning; Learning curve effect; Mediation; Organizational factors; Structural equation modeling; Industrial management

Because most members of electronic NoPs only know each other through electronic ties, they assess their peers' expertise through their online front. How participants present themselves is thus likely to impact the dynamics that take place within an electronic NoP. This research examines the relationships between how participants present themselves and how they participate in electronic NoPs. To do so, an electronic NoP related to banking was investigated. The profiles of a sample of 180 participants and a related sample of more than 1670 messages was collected and interpreted. Results show a constructed consistence between the profiles adopted by participants and the messages they post. Different categories of profiles emerged from the data and were significantly related to different types of contributions. Moreover, while the electronic NoP was growing at a fast pace, very few new participants adopted the behavior of active contributors, casting a shadow onto the future of the electronic NoP. This research contributes to the understanding of behaviors in virtual environments and of the temporal dimension of these behaviors.

Nevertheless, few organizations can afford to lose talent, including talented protean employees. This raises the question of what sort of organizations will attract protean employees. In this study, we explore the link between a protean career orientation and organizational preferences in Germany and the United States. 531 Students at various stages of university were surveyed in both countries.

Specifically, we explore how the capability of firms to compete with a greater number and variety of competitive actions is influenced by the changes in the access to both the structural and relational aspects of social capital. The structural aspect of the social capital is depicted by the network centrality and structural autonomy of the firms in the network, whereas the relational aspect is approximated by the functional variety of the alliance types (e.g., R&D, marketing, manufacturing, finance, distribution, etc.). Our empirical investigation showed that the diversity of the alliance types is positively related to the firms' ability to compete more intensively and with a wide variety of action types. Our findings suggest that it is the diversity and the non-redundancy of the ties with network partners (rather than the total number of alliances) that are most critical for an automaker's ability to out-compete rivals.",Austrian economics; Competitive dynamics; Interorganizational networks,Automobile manufacture; Automotive industry; Austrian economics; Competitive behavior; Competitive dynamics; Empirical investigation; Inter-organizational network; Interfirm network; Network centralities; Structural aspects; Automobiles

The first driver is the distinctiveness of suppliers' expertise compared to what their clients can get from competitors. The second driver is the realization of client-based scope economies through cross- selling. I analyze a unique longitudinal data set from the UK corporate legal market that comprises the client relationships of the largest UK law firms with FTSE 250 corporations, experts' assessment of law firms' capabilities, and law firms' profitability. I find that superior expertise relative to direct competitors and cross-selling, both by a focal firm and by its competitors, are important drivers of supplier profitability and client relationship stability. Moreover, cross-selling appears to be an important source of differentiation that also has a direct impact on competitors' ability to capture value.

We analyze why the OEM under scrutiny has encountered many problems in acting as a system integrator, and how it has learned from mistakes it had committed.

This study elaborates the essential role that institutional entrepreneurs play in shifting an internationally accepted regime of regulation, technology, and managerial practice from one stable state to another. The activities of institutional entrepreneurs are theorized in terms of Hayekian, Kirznerian, and Schumpeterian conceptions of entrepreneurship. Each conception varies in terms of entrepreneurial agency, which is defined as the capacity for creative, willful and non-routine action. The perspective is illustrated through the case of the Civil Air Navigation System Organization (CANSO) and its role in transforming the global air navigation regime in the recent decade.",Institutional entrepreneurship; Institutional theory; Regime change,Navigation systems; Institutional entrepreneurship; Institutional theory; Institutional transformation; Limited attentions; Managerial practices; Regime change; Stable state; Technological environment; Air navigation
The surprise of candor; Employee cynicism and technological change in late modernity work,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085399280&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2007.26530931&partnerID=40&md5=b4dbbe3608448b2297193a425ebc6d7d,"As an attitude characterized by frustration, hopelessness, betrayal and disillusionment (Andersson, 1996; Wanous et al. 1994) employee cynicism or organizational cynicism could be considered as both a general and specific attitude of interest to the research of information system (IS) implementations. Today a broad literature body has emerged within the IS research community investigating the organizational consequences of IS implementations breaking with the technical/rational tradition of the IS field. This article explores the relationship between employee cynicism and technological change and is based on a longitudinal case study of a Swedish customer service centre. The article reveals the challenges, criticism and cynicism among highly educated customer service centre employees going through a IS implementation process. We found two groups of users with distinct features: one group which had strong IS literacy yet expressed modest motivation and commitment towards work; another group which had strong work competence yet significant antipathy towards technological and organizational change. We conclude that cynicism represents an important but neglected aspect of IS implementation outcomes. More so, cynics may be important players in successfully implementing new IS.",IS implementation; Organizational change; Organizational cynicism,Personnel; Customer services; IS implementation; IS research communities; Longitudinal case study; Organizational change; Organizational cynicism; Swedishs; Technological change; Behavioral research

We suggest that whether negative feedback results in escalation or withdrawal is contingent on the efficacy perceptions of the decision making group. When efficacy perceptions are unduly high, groups will be initially motivated to persist despite evidence of the perils of so doing. High collective efficacy may also vitiate the quality of the group decision making process. If so, the initial desire to escalate will not only likely survive the decision making process, but may also be heightened by it. Implications of this approach for management theory, research, and practice are discussed.",Collective efficacy; Escalating commitment; Group decision making,Collective efficacy; Decision making process; Decision-making groups; Escalating commitment; Group Decision Making; Group decision making process; Management theory; Decision making
The importance of being 'something': Identity centrality and work outcomes in off-shored call centers in India,2007,"Academy of Management 2007 Annual Meeting: Doing Well by Doing Good, AOM 2007",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84950157657&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2007.26520196&partnerID=40&md5=9c50355008b7b4a3425fe2cc6bb65d50,"Existing studies of identity dynamics have shown that employees embody multiple social identities, and have multiple foci of identifications at work that shape their attitudes and behaviors. However, there remains an urgent need to extend these frameworks to the context of emergent global workplaces. In this paper, we focus on one such significant instance of contemporary globalization: the transnational service work in the international call center industry in India. Here we explore how national identity, religious identity and occupational identity centralities affect outcomes such as employee performance, intention to leave, stress and burnout over and above those engendered by organizational identification (OI). In our findings national identity centrality emerges as the most important predictor of outcomes as a main effect, and also the variable that significantly moderates the relationship of OI with performance and burnout. We also find some additional support for organizational identification and occupational identity centrality.",Identity centrality; National identity; Organizational identification,Call centers; Employee performance; Global workplaces; Identity centrality; International calls; National identity; Organizational identifications; Social identity; Job satisfaction

We explore the relationship between firm's Tobin's q, defined as the ratio of market value to the replacement value of firm's physical assets, and patents, accounting for the 'quality' of patents granted by the European Patent Office (EPO). We find that Tobin's q is positively and significantly associated with R&D and patent stocks. Given the increasing importance of software patents in the EPO, we tested for the impact of software patents on the market value of the firm and did not find any significant effect, in contrast to results for the United States.",Intellectual capital; Market valuation; Patents,Commerce; Finance; Knowledge management; Software testing; European Countries; Intellectual capital; Market valuations; Market values; Patents; Physical assets; Software patents; Patents and inventions

Formal organizations like firms are excellent at promoting cooperation, but knowledge communities are superior at fostering collaboration - the most important process in innovation. Rather than focusing on what encourages performance in formal organizations, we study what characteristics encourage aggregate superior performance in informal knowledge communities in the technical field of computer science. Specifically, we explore the way knowledge communities both draw on past knowledge, as seen in citations, and use rhetoric, as found in writing, to seek a basis for differential success. We find that when using knowledge, successful knowledge communities draw from a broad range of sources and are extremely flexible in changing and adapting. In marked contrast, when using rhetoric, successful knowledge communities tend to use very similar vocabularies and language that does not move or adapt over time and is not unique or esoteric compared to the vocabulary of other communities. A better understanding of how inter-organizational collaborative network structures encourage innovation is important to understanding what drives innovation and how to promote it.",Clustering; Innovation; Network,Networks (circuits); Clustering; Collaborative network; Inter-organizational; Knowledge communities; Technical fields; Knowledge management

First, we describe Ellul's notion of technique and his critique that technique has become dominant, becoming an end in itself and subsuming all other ends as means in support of technique. We then demonstrate how the workplace spirituality movement presently displays the hallmarks of technique in its quest for results and facts, in its use of experts, and in the broadening and hence dissolution of the notion of spirituality. However, the dominance of technique has not gone unnoticed in the workplace spirituality movement. We highlight several scholars who have raised concerns and critiques of the movement in its technical form. Having noted the predominance of technique as well as its critique from some quarters, we suggest some possibilities for moving toward an authentic spirituality at work followed by some implications for undertaking scholarly research on workplace spirituality that explicitly recognizes technical dominance in spirituality. In conclusion we note that the logic of technique is firmly in place, and that it represents a formidable opponent to the practice of authentic spirituality in the workplace. It is incumbent upon those of us involved in workplace spirituality to resist its domination and find ways of fostering authenticity in spirituality at work.",Jacques ellul; Technique; Workplace spirituality,Jacques ellul; Scholarly research; Technique; Workplace spirituality; Philosophical aspects

'Hands-on' influence attempts by vertical formal or informal team leaders are largely ineffective in this context, leading to a naturally arising leadership vacuum in dispersed innovation teams. Focusing on this domain, we briefly review the literature on alternatives to vertical leadership (e.g., emergent leadership, self-leadership, shared leadership). Based on this analysis, we adapt and extend the concept of shared leadership to the context of dispersed innovation teams. Specifically, we conceptualize shared leadership in this context as consisting of two distinct elements, i.e., proactive followership and mutual influence. Both are cross-level constructs. Proactive followership entails the individual seeking information from the team and reacting to influences from it, while mutual influence entails the individual exerting influence on the team. We develop propositions linking these two variables as well as their interaction term to the performance of dispersed innovation teams. Moreover, we discuss the role of the formal team leader in the context of shared leadership. As such, this paper pertains to this year's conference theme (Doing well by doing good) in that a more participatory understanding of leadership helps a larger group of employees (beyond just formal leaders) to more fully draw on their potentials and experience a more satisfying workplace.",Innovation; Shared leadership; Teams,Critical challenges; Cross levels; Distinct elements; Interaction term; Shared leadership; Team leaders; Team members; Teams; Personnel

The first cycle of criticism (1985-1995) targeted the lack of balance between soft and hard skills and the belief that acquisition of functional knowledge alone does not guarantee that students, albeit successful in the classroom, can actually 'do' the job of management. Responsible management educators have sought a variety of responses to this particularly poignant criticism, and one of the most effective responses has been competency-based programs aimed at assuring that participants can take best management practices and transfer them into their everyday experiences. The second cycle (1995- 2005) centered on the claim that business schools have failed to teach students how to grapple with complex, qualitative issues faced by firms competing in global markets. Here, too, the challenge for many schools of business has been to include strategic integration and global managerial competencies in the new curriculum. One model of a competency-based MBA with curricular design that was implemented in 2000 in response to the first cycle of criticism and revised again 5 years later in response to the new cycle of criticism is described.

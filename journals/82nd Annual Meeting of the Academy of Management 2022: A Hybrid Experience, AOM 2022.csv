We conjecture that these socio-historical shifts in life stage at entrepreneurial entry bear largely negative implications for entrepreneurial performance. Moreover, we argue for gender differences in the effect of parenthood on entrepreneurial performance, which we suggest have decreased over time due to the decline of traditional gender roles.

We found that producing this live service enacts a regenerative form of coordination that constitutes a dynamic capacity to effectively manage ongoing improvements and rapid recovery from unpredictable disruptions generated by cloud-based algorithms. © 2022 82nd Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2022: A Hybrid Experience, AOM 2022.All rights reserved.",,Algorithmics; Condition; Digital economy; Dynamic capacity; Field studies; Heterogeneous sources; On-going improvement; Precision Agriculture; Rapid recovery; Real- time

We argue that organizations have risk transfer, risk avoidance, risk reduction, and risk acceptance options, and combine these options to reduce the perceived effects of information security risks. Using data collected for the 2015-2018 years from S&P 500 firms by fine-tuning 11 state-of-the-art NLP models with causal extraction, we find that organizations' information security risk perception is positively associated with their information security risk transfer behavior less-risky boundary changing actions. © 2022 82nd Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2022: A Hybrid Experience, AOM 2022.All rights reserved.",,Risk management; Security of data; Behavioral theory of the firms; Fine tuning; Information security risks; Risk acceptance; Risk avoidance; Risk transfer; Risks management; Risks reduction; State of the art; Risk perception

The process explicates how work becomes a refuge in its three different forms: attention-based, time-based, and emotion-based. These forms are brought about by job crafting and provide a different mechanism to deal with grief. I also show the consequences of using job crafting to make work a refuge.

Yet, we argue that there are problems in how EO is conceptualized and measured. First, we critically review the shortcomings of current EO conceptualization by asking what EO means and how its three dimensions are related to entrepreneurship. Second, we argue that both reflective and formative measurement models used to model EO are problematic. We provide both simulation and meta-analytical evidence. We conclude that the three dimensions should be analyzed separately instead of being aggregated as a single variable as is currently done in the literature. © 2022 82nd Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2022: A Hybrid Experience, AOM 2022.All rights reserved.",,'current; Entrepreneurial orientation; Formative measurements; IS problems; Measurement model; Single variable; Three dimensions

Developing this argument, we propose an Innovation-Participation-Trust (IPT) model within which LBOs introduce operational innovation, which enhances workforce participation, thus increasing workforce trust in management.

These conditions represent a set of knowledge problems that an entrepreneur faces. Yet, research on the accurate diagnosis and sources of knowledge problems leading to entrepreneurial action remains underdeveloped. Identification of the sources of knowledge problems and incorporation of the mechanisms through which knowledge problems impact entrepreneurial action are needed to advance entrepreneurial action theory. We derive propositions that explain the sources and effects of knowledge problems, resulting in a middle-range theory of entrepreneurial action. By identifying the role of the external environment and associated changes as sources of knowledge problems, we bridge the gap between macro-level environmental changes and micro-level entrepreneurial action. © 2022 82nd Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2022: A Hybrid Experience, AOM 2022.All rights reserved.",,Action theory; Condition; Entrepreneurial action; Environmental change; External environments; Fault line; Micro level; Middle-range theory

Yet little knowledge exists about how boards adapt their composition or leadership to reduce conflict. In this study, we develop theory to propose that boards with strong demographic faultlines between factions will seek a compromise by appointing an outsider board chair. We further argue that the strength of this relationship depends on the likelihood of conflict across faultlines, the availability of an alternative impartial leader on the board, and the salience of pressures from outside the board.

We use policy convergence theory and systematically examine FDI screening measures across a sample of LMEs using natural language processing (NLP).

While claims of greenwashing abound and are the subject of increasing scrutiny, many firms making real changes have, paradoxically, chosen to downplay and understate their accomplishments. In this paper we draw on emerging literature on brownwashing and silence to offer a comprehensive study of why and how firms undertake such activities, linking extant insights as well as offering a novel model and reconceptualization. Our rich qualitative study with leaders at over 50 North American wineries allows us to offer in depth and in situ insights. Our findings, first, highlight new mechanisms of non-communication not yet identified in this emerging literature. Second, our analysis offers the important insight that firms don't simply hide their achievements in a reactive manner to avoid negative stakeholder pressures, as in current theory, but also do so when their practices are leading or more proactive than those of stakeholders. Finally, we examine three strategies by which firms divide and conquer through what we term bifurcated stakeholder communications: locational, channel, and temporal. This study also has important practical implications as society, policymakers, and NGOs seek to drive industry change on social and environmental grand challenges, and strive to engage firms publicly in leading change and addressing these challenges. © 2022 82nd Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2022: A Hybrid Experience, AOM 2022.All rights reserved.",,Current theories; Divide-and-conquer; Greenwashing; New mechanisms; North American; Policy makers; Public pressures; Qualitative study; Stakeholder communications; Stakeholder pressures

Firms need to commit resources to a response while being uncertain whether the stakeholder will commit resources to reward or sanction the response in the future. In the context of sustainable investing, we study how firms evaluate the authenticity of investor's requests. We find that firms evaluate authenticity by examining investor's underlying resource commitments. We contribute to stakeholder theory by suggesting that authenticity is an additional factor in deciding how and whether to respond to stakeholder requests. © 2022 82nd Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2022: A Hybrid Experience, AOM 2022.All rights reserved.",,Resource commitment; Stakeholder theory

Our results indicate that most employers do not have coordinated policies or practices in place to promote equity for disadvantaged job seekers or employees. Even those with D&I initiatives do not explicitly include immigrants as a group warranting special accommodation. We thus offer practical recommendations for organizations, critique the narrow lens through which immigrant employment is examined, and point to the need for more interdisciplinary research to incorporate the voices of all stakeholders. © 2022 82nd Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2022: A Hybrid Experience, AOM 2022.All rights reserved.",,Job seekers; Practical recommendation

For these studies, test-retest reliabilities of p = 0.70 or higher are an often-cited reliability criterion. Despite their widespread use, however, there is little rigorous analysis if test-retest reliability-at any level-relates to model efficacy. Informed by a comprehensive literature review, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the effect of various test-retest reliabilities in conjoint experiments. Our results suggest researchers should adopt a more nuanced usage of test-retest reliability, particularly as it relates to the p = 0.70 standard. © 2022 82nd Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2022: A Hybrid Experience, AOM 2022.All rights reserved.",,Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Reliability analysis; Conjoint experiments; Decision-making process; Literature reviews; Monte Carlo's simulation; Reliability criterion; Research designs; Rigorous analysis; Test-retest reliability; Decision making

In the past decade, Corporate Accelerator (CA) programs have increasingly been adopted across industries as a more radical CV form of corporate experimentation. Yet, academic research on CAs is in its infancy, with a nascent but growing body of work only emerging over the past 5-6 years. This aims to accelerate CA research in academia by understanding the roots, and evolution of extant literature, and drawing a path for the future. We examine the scholar origins of CV research tracing the way from its roots to the nascence of CAs in 2016 and beyond. Along this track, we map the core literature, identifying main academic contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes across CV intermediaries so as to provide an organizing framework for the emerging field of CA. We do this by applying a structured mixed method literature review from 1981-2021, combining bibliometric analyses (co-citation and citation analysis) with a subsequent detailed qualitative analysis, following a CIMO (context, intermediary, mechanism, outcome) inductive framework. Through this process, we offer a framework and agenda with specific topics for future CA research. © 2022 82nd Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2022: A Hybrid Experience, AOM 2022.All rights reserved.",,Academic research; Accelerator projects; Bibliometrics analysis; Citation analysis; Cocitation; Corporate venturing; Corporates; Literature reviews; Mixed method; Strategic renewal

In this paper, we demonstrate that political polarization may play an important role in organizational dynamics, by revealing that polarization may expedite destigmatization of legal yet historically stigmatized markets. Specifically, we test a theory explaining how polarization normalizes counter-normative behavior and, consequently, encourages customers to become open about their engagement with stigmatized products and organizations leading to market destigmatization. © 2022 82nd Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2022: A Hybrid Experience, AOM 2022.All rights reserved.",,Commerce; Legislative politics; Organisational; Organizational dynamics; Polarization

Research on organizational stigma has made large strides in the past two decades, yet intra-organizational processes that condition the lived experience of those who are stigmatized have remained black-boxed. We examine how intra-organizational dynamics affect the process of organizational stigmatization through an empirical case of a public broadcaster that initially experienced episodic stigmatization. We demonstrate how internal contention in the organization favored those who opposed the stigma, leading to an organizational response characterized by defiance and denial. This reinforced audience disapproval of the broadcaster, leading to core stigmatization-the discounting of the organization as a whole based on a core identity. Our study contributes to understanding stigma not as an attribute but as a process, where the nature of stigma is susceptible to change not only due to environmental factors but also as a result of the actions (and inactions) of the stigmatized organization. Additionally, we shed light on the intraorganizational processes that generate organizational responses to stigma. © 2022 82nd Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management 2022: A Hybrid Experience, AOM 2022.All rights reserved.",,Condition; Environmental factors; Organisational; Organizational dynamics; Organizational process

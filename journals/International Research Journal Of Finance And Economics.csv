Corporate governance and the growth of small business service firms in India,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867089574&partnerID=40&md5=1f7ef2d8f3ac005df9f1b6de4665dc69,"This study examines the relationship between corporate governance and the growth of small business service firms in India. Small business owners from the Punjab area of India were surveyed to gather information. Subjects were asked about their perceptions, beliefs, and feelings regarding the factors that affect the growth of their firms. This study utilized survey research (a non-experimental field study design). Findings of this study show that the growth of small business service firms in India is positively associated with CEO Tenure, CEO Duality, Number of Board Meetings, and Total Assets, and negatively associated with the Board Size. The findings also show that when small business performance is held constant, the growth of small business service firms acts as a positive function of CEO Tenure and Board Size, and a negative function of CEO Duality in India. The study contributes to the literature on factors that affect the growth of small business service firms. The findings may be useful for small business owners, investors, stakeholders, and small business management consultants. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Assets; Corporate Governance; India; Small Business Growth; Small Business Performance,
Forecasting tourism expenditure and growth: A VAR/VECM analysis for Greece at both aggregated and disaggregated levels,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867094668&partnerID=40&md5=639bff43f2b91e9840bafa4cd52ce18a,"Tourism is one of the most important factors in the productivity of the Greek economy with significant multiplier effects on the country's economic activity. This study tests for the existence and direction of causality between output growth and tourism expenditure using a trivariate model with real effective exchange rate, analysed as a whole and in sub-categories respectively for the period 1988-2011. Results from the aggregated model indicate that all variables return to their long-run equilibrium relationships and unidirectional causal relationship is reported from tourism expenditure to real output in the short-run. Moreover, results from the disaggregated model imply strong bidirectional causal links between growth and business travel and tourism spending (BTS) in the longrun and unidirectional causal links from leisure travel and tourism spending (LTS) to growth and to BTS. Forecasts for the period 2012-2020 indicate increasing total tourism expenditure and particularly for the case of BTS. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Cointegration; Economic Growth; Greece; Tourism Expenditures; VECM,

The Estrada's model (2002) which has been assigned just to determine the variable of expected rate of return in the capital market, has some limitations and has not spot the effects of market conditions sort on the other variables. The aim of the present paper is to recognize the conditions of Tehran Stock Exchange from symmetry-asymmetry aspect and remark its relation to price index movements and financial dynamism of economic institutions. The research methods in this research are descriptive, comparative and correlative. Data have been collected from Tehran Stock Exchange archive. The statistical population size consists of all companies in Tehran Stock Exchange during 1997-2009. In order to compare two capital market operation indicators (price index and dynamism of capital market), in the symmetric conditions of financial market with the asymmetric case, applying the test for comparison the mean of both populations, we resulted that in Tehran Stock Exchange, the sort of financial market conditions (symmetric-asymmetric), does not affect on the trading bulk (the evaluation index for dynamism of capital market), however a considerable part of price index movements occur due to different conditions of the financial market. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Asymmetric markets; Price index; Symmetric markets; Trading bulk,

An investigation of the effect of Aggressive working capital technique on the performance of manufacturing firms in Nigeria,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867087712&partnerID=40&md5=cd16135b6c71f47b22c2c6162410015a,"Increased financial flexibility and value creation can be achieved through effective management of working capital when companies sharply reduce their dependence on external funding and can use the available cash for further investments or acquisitions. By 'aggressively' collecting receivables, ruthlessly delaying payments to suppliers and cutting inventories across the board manufacturers can run away from high working capital ratios. The study examined the relationship between working capital aggressiveness and financial performance of manufacturing firms in Nigeria. The study was based on secondary data collected from ten listed-manufacturing firms in Nigeria Stock Market for the period 2006 to 2010 with an attempt to investigate whether a relationship exists between their performances (Return on Assets and Return on Equity) and aggressive working capital variables (Aggressive Investing Variable; Current Assets/Total Assets and Aggressive Financing Variable; Current Liabilities/Total Assets). The relationships were measured using multiple linear regressions-MLR- statistical tool of analysis. The manufacturing companies were selected using convenience sampling. The findings show that there is 'higher' return on assets (ROA) but 'lower' risk involved when total assets are financed by aggressive current assets (CA/TA) but higher risks with lower return when financed by aggressive current liabilities (CL/TA) hence, inversely correlated. The results also depict that both aggressive current assets and liabilities will bring lower returns on equity (ROE), hence negatively correlated whereby higher risks involved for aggressive current assets and a lower risks involved for aggressive current liabilities respectively. The study recommended that an appropriate level of current assets should be established in financing the assets of firms in which return on equity will not be negatively affected and return on assets would not be reduced and hence, those short-term liabilities should not be delayed in making payments to those they are due to. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Aggressive; Manufacturing Firms; Nigeria; ROA; ROE; Working Capital,
A critical evaluation of the significance of round numbers in European equity markets in light of the predictions from Benford's law,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865818333&partnerID=40&md5=1e2412c3527be1504d767af48f736ff7,"In this study, we test the hypothesis that psychological barriers exist in 5 European Equity Market indices [ATX, CAC, DAX, FTSE, SMI]. We employ both a traditional methodology that assumes a uniform distribution of M-Values and a modified approach that accounts for the fact that the digits of stock prices may be distributed in accordance with Benford's law. In addition, we test the validity of the various assumptions employed in these tests using a Monte Carlo Simulation and Kuiper's Modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness of Fit Test. We find evidence for barriers in 1 index [SMI] at the 1000 level under the assumption of uniformity but no significant evidence of barriers at the 100 level or at the 1000 level in the remaining indices. We also find evidence that substantiates the criticism of the use of the uniformity assumption for tests at the 1000 level in favour of a distribution consistent with Benford's Law. However, we do not reach a different conclusion on the presence of psychological barriers when tests are performed without the implicit use of that uniformity assumption. In addition, we find possible evidence of price clustering around round numbers at the 1000 level in 2 indices [CAC, DAX] even after adjusting for the expected concentration within the region due to Benford-specific effects. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Benford's Law; Psychological barriers in stock prices; Significance of round numbers in stock prices,

In theory of economics, payment systems and credit card markets were considered to be one of the classical examples of two-sided markets. The credit card markets of the USA and western countries have been analyzed by various economists through the models established. However, economists have not been much attracted to the analysis of the dynamics of the market by modeling the Turkish credit card market with a structure different from its western counterparts. Because the banks in Turkish credit card market carry out both the functions of issuer and acquirer, such transactions as On-Us are intensely realized. Therefore, the profit functions of Turkish banks in credit card markets were different from the models analyzing the credit card markets of the USA and western countries. In the study, the attempts of the banks in Turkish credit card market to maximize their profits and their results have been dealt with, and the factors affecting the profits of the banks have been analyzed. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Networks; Turkish Credit Card Market; Two-sided Markets,

Like a canker worm, NPAs have been eating the banking industries from within, since nationlisation of banks in 1969. NPAs have choked off quantum of credit, restriction the recycling of funds and leads to asset-liability mismatches. It also affected profitability, liquidity and solvency position of the Indian banking sector. One of the major reasons for NPAs in the banking sector is the 'Direct Lending System' by the RBI under social banking motto of the Government, under which scheduled commercial banks are required to lend 40% of their total credit to priority sector. The banks who have advanced to the priority sector and reached the target suffocated on account of raising NPAs, since long. The priority sector NPAs have registered higher growth both in percentage and in absolute terms year after year. The present paper is an attempt to study the priority sector advances by the public, private and foreign bank group-wise, target achieved by them and a comparative study on priority and non-priority sector NPAs over the period of 10 years between 2001-02 and 2010-11.

The analysis of Turkey from the viewpoint of the foreign debt structure and the impact of the foreign borrowing on economic growth,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864473290&partnerID=40&md5=ceaf99c8e68fd87ec1eaba1b30dbc407,"Among the most prominent reasons for the problems that are experienced in relation to the growth performances of developing counties such as Turkey, insufficient capital stock is in the foreground. In such economies, the reason for the lack of capital stock lies within the low income levels. Low income levels cause low savings, which would be required for sufficient investments to build up the capital stock. For this reason, putting aside the fact that growth is difficult for developing countries without utilising external financing, in which conditions the external resources are being acquired and where they are channelled to can greatly determine the effects of foreign loans on economic growth. In this study, the relationship between the foreign debt and economic growth in Turkey has been examined using the annual data from the terms of 1980-2010. In order to study the direction of the relationship between the variables and their size, the Johansen cointegration and error correction model has been utilised. According to the empiric results, while foreign debts have an effect on the economic growth in the long term, no such effect is present in the short term. In addition to this, the result of the study has shown that the possible foreseen effects of the incurring debt have a close relationship with the balance due. Within this context, while the increasing amount of the short term loans within the foreign debt stock has a negative impact on economic growth, findings, indicating that long term debts have a positive effect on the economic growth have been acquired. From this point, it can be deduced that the user cost of the debt increases by the shortening due of the debt and because of this such sources cannot be used for the financing of real investments and also the fact that they exit the system without producing a significant real value indicates that such debts cannot be beneficial to economic growth. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Co-integration; Economic growth; Foreign debt,

We investigate the impact of the pricing strategies of the intermediate goods supplier on the domestic optimal trade policies of the final goods trading nations. This study finds that, in contrast to bilateral trade without a vertical relationship and assuming there exists a linear demand for the final goods, regardless of whether this upstream supplier adopts price discrimination or uniform pricing, the optimal import tariff for bilateral trade will be categorically reduced. We also find that the optimal tariff for the larger of the two nations will remain positive, whereas it may be plausible for the smaller of the two nations to adopt import subsidies instead, depending on the relative size of the domestic market. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Bilateral trade; Import subsidy; Import tariff; Price discrimination; Uniform pricing; Vertical relationship; Vertically related market,

To adjust the price differences between the areas during a year, the Paasche Price Index at primary sampling unit level is used so that the poverty estimates are consistent. Poverty lines for the other years are obtained by adjusting the base poverty line i.e. 1998-99 by composite price index and thus obtained poverty estimates are comparable. The results show that there was an increasing trend in poverty estimates between 1992-93 through 2001-02 except between 1993-94 and 1996-97.

The paper notes that most Sub-Saharan African (SSA) nations are over-dependent on low absolute rent from agriculture and other natural resources. It demonstrates the need for SSA countries to embark on reforms to ensure adequate mobilization and strategic deployment of their meagre earnings from agriculture and mineral resources to develop their economic and technological capacities, and thus earn technological rent. The paper calls for sound economic, financial and institutional re-engineering programmes for developing countries, particularly in the SSA to help them overcome their balance of payment deficits. In such a re-engineering framework, the paper advocates the concentration of efforts on five main areas of economic, financial and institutional reforms. Specifically, it calls for the creation of necessary enabling environment for economic and financial activities to thrive by removing institutional impediments to economic growth, and the provision of a government-led coordination that is necessary at the present stage of the economic development of most SSA economies. It suggests the liberalization of the financial sectors to boost foreign direct and portfolio investments while cautioning against unregulated liberalism, and the creation of value-added production operations. It advocates the reforms of domestic banks to adequately reposition them as development oriented banks that could make them serve as agents of economic and technological developments. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Economic development; Economic growth; National economies and technological rent,

To investigate the relationships, two panel data equations are formed for each leverage measure. The findings indicate that firm size and collateral value of assets are positively related to leverage, while dividend payout ratio, profitability and CEO duality are negatively related to leverage. On the other hand, firm size and profitability are negatively related to the level of short term-debt, whereas it has positive relations with dividend pay-out ratio and ownership concentration.

Despite the positive relationship between stock market development indicators and economic growth in the world, influence of such relationship is considerably lower than dedicated credits from banking system to private sector, due to lack of development and integrated market and correctly leading such financial resources of Iranian stock exchange towards economic and monetary market growth. It is important to note that there is a direct relationship between forming and integrating of financial and monetary markets of stock and investment, inflation rate, financial development, and economic growth that it is possible to increase investment of the most firms and industries by collecting, planning and guiding such technical reservoirs. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Investment; Monetary and financial market; Stock; Stock exchange; Technical reservoirs,
The application of GARCH and EGARCH in modeling the volatility of daily stock returns during massive shocks: The empirical case of Egypt,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867085004&partnerID=40&md5=f45f75d2465e40a139e690ed757af370,"Modeling volatility during a financial crisis where massive shocks are generated presents an ideal environment for investigating the dynamics of volatility during periods of extreme fluctuations for comparison with volatility during more tranquil periods. The objective of this paper is to study volatility of daily stock returns listed on the Egyptian Exchange during the political turmoil of 2011. The analysis is based on employing both GARCH and EGARCH models. Daily closing prices of four Egyptian stock market indices, the EGX 30, EGX70, EGX 100, and the EGX 20 capped were used in the analysis. The time frame was from the inception of each index to the 30 th of June 2012. The sample period covers the period of pre-and post the Egyptian revolution which was shaped by extreme volatile fluctuations in stock returns. The EGARCH model was the method of choice for modeling the volatility in order to investigate the long memory and the leverage effect in the volatilities of the two periods. The findings reveal higher volatility during the revolution period for all indices reflected in higher standard deviations for both daily returns and absolute returns, with the EGX 70 displaying the highest volatility. The leverage effect was more apparent during the revolution period. However, long memory was more apparent during the pre-revolution period. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",ARCH; EGARCH; GARCH; Revolution; The Egyptian Exchange; Volatility,
The factors affecting capital structure for each group of enterprises in each debt ratio threshold: Evidence from Vietnam's seafood processing enterprises,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864817879&partnerID=40&md5=12bc6f984f0b0632ca5d0e0f26c8919a,"Inspired by findings of the previous study by us (Cuong and Canh, 2012), this paper assess the factors affecting capital structure of Vietnam's seafood processing enterprises (SEAs) in each debt ratio threshold. Dependent variable is the debt ratio expressed as total liabilities divided by total assets. The investigation has been performed using panel data procedure for a sample of 92 SEAs during 2005-2010. Total observations were 552, including 301 and 251 for models applied to firms that maintain a debt ratio above 59.27% and less than 59.27% respectively. Two econometric panel data techniques, fixed effects and random effects are employed. Hausman's specification test is performed in order to test appropriate model for the study. The results shows that fixed effects model should be appropriate for this study as compared to random effects model. Accordingly, capital structures present significant differences between the two groups, firms that maintain a debt ratio above 59.27% (OSEAs) and debt ratio less 59.27% (LSEAs). For both types of enterprises, size by assets has positive relationship with financial leverage, and tangible assets have negative relationship with financial leverage. They are significant determinants of enterprises' capital structure. For LSEAs, profitability and liquidity are important determinants of capital structure. Meanwhile, interest expense is significant determinants for OSEAs. In relation to interaction effects, tangible assets, and interest expense are significant in explaining the differences in capital structure between OSEAs relative to LSEAs'. Our findings are consistent with the Trade off theory and Pecking order theory. The findings suggest implications for Vietnam's seafood processing enterprises (SEAs) on flexible usage of financial leverage. Specifically, to increase or decrease the level of financial leverage, SEAs need to take into account size, tangible assets, profitability and liquidity of enterprises as well as recommend measures to cope with shocks in variations of bank interest rates. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Capital Structure; Debt Ratio Threshold; LSEAs; OSEAs; SEAs,

Results show that Bangladesh stock market has significant day-of-the-week effect. When cross-sectional risk is incorporated in the model, day-of-the-week effect still persists. For most of the models used in the study, cross-sectional risk and auto-correlation coefficients are significantly positive, which suggests that the market rewards for taking risk and that the market is predictable. Use of interactive dummy variables shows that even though risk is higher on some of these days, day-of-the-week effects still exist after considering for cross-sectional risk.

Evaluating the impact of financial development on economic growth in Jordan,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864805828&partnerID=40&md5=f1ff823f14450362933500fe7ec30885,"This study aims to examine the impact of financial development on economic growth in Jordan over the period 1992-2011. The most widely financial development measures used in earlier literature are employed and grouped into currency ratios, monetary ratios, financial ratios and percent of credit to private sector while the economic growth is measured by growth in real GDP per capita. The correlation coefficients between financial development indicators and economic growth indicator are observed over the study period to discern those indicators that are highly correlated with economic growth and these variables are entered in the later phases of analysis. The notable finding in this phase is that despite the noticeable growth in most financial development indicators especially the percent of credit to private sector as a percent of GDP (P2) over the last two decade, the parallel progress in economic growth is relatively much lesser. In the next phase of analysis, we regressed the most important financial development indicators detected in the earlier phase that include the ratio of currency outside banks as percent of narrow money supply (C1), the ratio of narrow money supply as percent of GDP (M2), the ratio of banking sector assets as percent of GDP (F1) and the ratio of private sector credit as percent of total banking sector credit (P1) on the economic growth (Y) and find that these variables explain about sixty-five percent of the economic growth over the study period. Our results indicate that apart from monetary ratio M1 (narrow money supply as percent of GDP), all the other employed financial ratios are significantly correlated with economic growth indicator. In the last phase of analysis, we employed Granger Causality Test to detect the direction of relationship between financial development indicators in one hand and the economic growth indicator on the other hand and find narrow evidence that the financial development indicators and particularly the ratio of banking sector assets as percent of GDP (F1)Granger causes the economic growth. Our main remark based on this analysis is that despite employing large number of financial development indicators which proven to be high correlated with each other and have witnessed significant growth over the study period, the impact of these variables on economic growth is limited which necessitate further studies to detect the main obstacles that deter the economic growth in Jordan. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Developing countries; Economic growth; Financial deepening; Granger- Causality; Jordan,

Unlike the existing literature, which employs a linear specification, we use a translog revenue function to determine the type of competitive equilibrium prevailing in the Lebanese banking sector. The estimation results of translog revenue equation by the fixed effects model and the Within-SUR method show that the assumptions of perfect competition and monopoly can be rejected in favor of those of monopolistic competition. The application of the model of Panzar and Rosse to the test of equilibrium, as suggested by Shaffer (1982), indicates that the test of a long-run equilibrium is respected in the various estimations. The Evolution of the statistical results obtained from Panzar and Rosse model over the period 2000-2010 indicate an intensification of banking competition. However, the evolution of statistical results relative to the level of production does not confirm the hypothesis that large banks are more competitive than small banks. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Banking Competition; Fixed effects model; Panzar and Rosse model; Translog function,

The output gap percentage approach was used to examine the level of excess capacity in the industry from 2007 to 2011. The study was limited to those years due to dearth of data for the previous years of existence of GSM in the country. Using the data on installed capacity and active lines, the approach confirms that the industry did not operate at full capacity during the years under consideration, instead of 100% level of capacity utilization, 47.73%, 40.25%, 46.19%, 38.16% and 38.39% respectively were recorded for the years.

It also showed a significant inverse relationship between the financial structure and profitability, liquidity at the level of 1%. Because of the inverse relationship between financial leverage and profitability, the study recommended that the service sector should rely on retained earnings in seeking financing, with the condition of high rates of profitability in the company, in order to depend on internal financing in the case of gaining a certain investment opportunity, rather than resorting on the borrowing that carries high risk, and keeping pace with the current economic status which is characterized by instability. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Capital Structure; Financial leverage; Liquidity; Long-term debts and working capital; Profitability; Total liabilities,

Since it's size is not known exactly, the determination and implementation of macroeconomic and social policies become very critical. The measurement of the underground economy has been the subject of intense debate in the literature. Some authors have used the direct method to assess the underground economy while others have attempted an indirect method, known as the non-monetary approach and monetary approach, respectively. A commonly used approach to measure the size of the underground economy, known as the monetary method, is based on econometric estimates of the demand for currency. The currency demand approach provides some insight into the size and development of the underground economy in Turkey. This study follows the monetary approach based on a monetary indicator and in particular the amount of currency in circulation.

Business contract approval announcements usually influence stock price and are crucial to investors because they explicitly and directly increase a firm's future cash flow without distortion by the managerial process. The efficiency role proposes that public announcements will have no or relatively low effect on stock returns, while the informative role suggests that stock returns are affected by announcements. More specifically, if the efficiency role has any weight in the explanation of abnormal returns, it should be observed relatively smaller abnormal returns on winning government contracts and larger size contracts to corporate and smaller size contracts. But, if the informative roles play a significant weight in the explanation, relatively larger abnormal returns on winning government contract and larger size contracts should be observed. This study reveals that business contract announcements yield positive effects on stock returns, both on and after the event date. The findings also suggest that corporate and small size contract announcements show higher cumulative abnormal returns relative to the cumulative abnormal returns on governmental and larger size contract announcements.

The evidence suggests strong long-run overperformance after the issuance. This result is in contrast to the evidence of underperformance after the straight debt issues (Speiss and Affleck-Graves, 1999). Our results support the evidence that the ERCs in bonds issued by the firms closer to financial distress or with low credit rating, help significantly reduce the agency problem between the common stockholders and the bondholders resulting in direct cost benefit to the firm in terms of reduced yields. This benefit seems to far outweigh the costs to the stockholders in terms of agency cost of potential management entrenchment and/or potential loss of takeover premium.

The role and importance of audit in the intellectual property rights to support the economy in the hashemite kingdom of Jordan,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864424923&partnerID=40&md5=2f4d8635e225d08e6121378959dcf24c,"The paper aims to indicate the role of the importance of auditing in the intellectual property to support the national economy. The activation of the role of auditing in the intellectual property rights to avoid risks resulted from the absence of audit to avoid failure, and breach of others rights, and avoid economic political and cultural sanctions. The study shows the basic components to activate the process of auditing the rights of intellectual property to achieve its role as it is necessary to provide a legal framework that enforce the audit and review of intellectual property rights. It should also provide professional regulations that organize and guide the auditor in the implementation of audit of intellectual property rights. The basic component is also to develop framework of knowledge related to the intellectual property rights for the auditor such as the basics of property rights, including accounting treatment and reporting of intellectual property rights processes, and the audit procedures and the evidences and tests needed. The basic component of intellectual property rights audit is to identify risks related to intellectual property rights in planning and implementation of the audit. To achieve the study objectives, the researcher has used the descriptive and analytical approach such as a review of the theoretical literature associated with the study, a survey of the views of auditors in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on the role and importance of the intellectual property audit, and the basic components of audit of intellectual property rights. The study has found that the audit of intellectual property rights has an economic role, and it requires the components concerning a legal and professional regulation of an audit of intellectual property rights. In addition there is a need to develop a plan to audit the intellectual property by identifying the relative importance and the risks associated with the audit of intellectual property rights, and to develop also knowledge framework associated with the audit of intellectual property rights. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Audit of intellectual property rights; The economic role of intellectual property audit,

We have used panel data analysis for 467 firms listed on respective stock exchanges in Asia including China, Japan, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran and Korea for the period of 2001 to 2010. In empirical analysis regression analysis is used to check the relationship between stock price fluctuations and firms' distribution decisions. We have also used some of the variables as control variables which include size of firm, firms' earning volatility, financial leverage and growth in assets. Dividend yield and pay-out ratio were used as proxy of distribution decision and results show that both measures have a significant impact on share price fluctuations. The sensitivity of the distribution decision to share price volatility enhanced during 2001-2010. While pay-out ratio has a significant impact at lower significance level. During study period the size of firm and financial leverage have a positive significant impact on share price volatility. Whereas earning volatility has a negative significant impact on share price volatility. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Share price volatility; Valuation theories,

Banking is a service industry and a bank's most important investments would be in items related to intellectual capital such as its human resources, brand building, systems and processes to ensure delivery of high quality services. Therefore, it becomes imperative that banks should manage their intellectual capital as efficiently as possible. In this respect, the Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (VAIC) model as propounded by Pulic Ante has emerged as an important tool to measure the performance of service organisations such as banks. The present study is an attempt to analyze the intellectual capital efficiency of public and private sector banks in India through the VAIC model for a period from 2007 to 2011. The study also examines the comparative performance of these banks on the basis of the three main components of VAIC - Human Capital Efficiency, Structural Capital Efficiency and Capital Employed Efficiency.

We then use a linear program to minimize CVaR and to obtain optimal portions to invest in each stock. In order to compare the selection done by the CVaR optimization method with what could be obtained by mean-variance approach, we use Genetic Algorithm to select stocks and to determine the optimal portions corresponding to the portfolio return already obtained by the CVaR optimization method.

In this study, We use ROE as surrogate for firm value and debt ratio (DA) as surrogate for capital structure and as the threshold variable. The empirical results strongly indicate that two-threshold effect exists between debt ratio and firm value. Besides, the coefficient is positive when debt ratio is less than 59.27%, which implies that debt financing can improve firm value. The coefficient is negative and presents a decreasing trend when the debt ratio is between 59.27% and 94.60% or above 94.60%, implying that, in that regime, a further increase in debt financing, deteriorates firm value. We, therefore, compelled to conclude that the relationship between leverage and firm value has a nonlinear relationship represents an convex Parapol shape.

Economic consequence of post-SOX restatement,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863104500&partnerID=40&md5=d2287d9f416721e01999dcf14d3d6923,"Following over seven years of implementation of Section 404, debate continues regarding its perceived benefits and costs, with the costs appearing excessive and the benefits unclear Although the costs and benefits of Section 404 are difficult to measure, audit fees and internal control quality are one area where they can be quantified. This study focuses solely on restating companies as research samples to investigate the relationship among internal controls, restatements, and audit fees. Empirical results show that companies with high restatement severity are more likely to subsequently pay higher audit fees. Specifically, companies with core-earnings restated and more account groups restated are associated with subsequent higher audit fees charged. Finally, this work examines whether and how audit firms consider the length of auditor-client relationship in making audit pricing decisions, particularly after clients experience higher severity restatements. My results suggest that auditors consider companies' restatement severity and auditor-client relationship in making audit pricing decisions. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Audit fee; Auditor-client relationship; Internal control; Restatement,

We also show that companies experiencing higher credit constraints are more vulnerable to adverse economic fluctuations. Our panel regression analysis on a sample of 65,000 observations of companies from the Baltic countries shows that companies perceiving higher credit constraints tend to invest more during periods of economic growth compared to companies experiencing lower credit constraints. Furthermore, we have identified a difference between the investment behaviour of local companies and the overall less credit constrained multinationals (MNCs) during recessions, when MNCs seem to invest more compared to their local counterparts and appear therefore to be less vulnerable to economic fluctuations. Our results imply that since MNCs are able to spread their investments over the economic cycle, they are in a better position to avoid potential overinvestment. Local companies, on the other hand, might be more susceptible to overinvestment and suffer losses under adverse economic fluctuations. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Credit constraints; Economic fluctuations; Investments,

Using a panel of 942 Taiwanese listed companies during 2006-2009, we employ content analysis to explore environmental disclosure in annual report, and adapt an advanced panel regression model. The paper finds that enterprises have increasingly focused on the annual disclosure of environmental information in annual report during the sample period; however, there is a gap for firms to improve practical environmental disclosure. The empirical results indicate that the higher degree of discrepancy between the voting rights of controlling shareholders and the ratio of cash flow rights in the environmentally sensitive industry, the lower level of corporate disclosure of environmental information. Evidence indicates that the environmental information disclosure of enterprises in sensitive industries was positively affected by the equity pledge ratio of directors, demonstrating that stakeholders focused on the pollution prevention information of the environmentally sensitive industry. Therefore, the sensitive industry companies tend to detailed disclosure of environmental information. Regarding firms in non-sensitive industries, the three corporate governance mechanisms have no significant impact on corporate disclosure of environmental information.

To test these hypotheses, we examine layoff announcement events in U.S. public companies from 1995 to 2007. The empirical results present that firms announcing layoffs in highly concentrated industries are associated with a lower layoff rate, but the relation between industrial concentration and layoffs is not significant during an economic downturn.

When frequency distributions are examined, however, it occurs that larger deviations of trade prices from net asset values are very rare and the rest are not economically material. Therefore, there is limited number of arbitrage opportunities for the traders of the Non-Financial Istanbul 20. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Mispricing; Non-financial Istanbul 20; Sector exchange traded funds,
Deposit insurance increase and risk taking by banks,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863735598&partnerID=40&md5=26c7fe522ac1ae42c1f37cdf089abad3,"This paper examines the effect of the 150% increase in deposit insurance coverage in 1980 on risk taking by banks in the U.S. The analysis is potentially relevant since recently there have substantial increases in deposit insurance coverage in many countries that are comparable in magnitude to the increase in U.S. deposit insurance earlier. It is found that the jump in deposit insurance coverage is associated with banks taking more risk. The absolute value of the negative correlation between market value of assets/book value of assets and three measures of bank risk - systematic, unsystematic and total - is significantly increased subsequent to the increase in deposit insurance coverage. Risk taking is positively associated with bank size and significantly more so following increase in deposit insurance coverage. It can be argued that appropriate policy associated with an expansion of deposit insurance coverage include steps to adequately capitalize banks, with tightening of bank capital requirements to mitigate the potential costs of greater risk with greater coverage, and increased monitoring of bank activity, particularly that of large institutions. Estimation of panel data is with fixed effect estimation corrected with heteroskedasticity robust variance matrix of estimates. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Bank risk; Deposit insurance; Moral hazard,

The paper then addresses the question of the determinants that could explain this phenomenon. Empirical studies indicate the importance of transition-specific determinants of FDI. Some studies even argue that their explanatory capacity is exhaustive and independent of classical theory. The patterns of FDI also differ from those in developed countries. The purpose of this research is to identify the actual factors determining the decision of multinational firms to invest in transition countries. Empirical results seem to validate the hypothesis that both classical and transition-specific determinants have a theoretical foundation. The main difference of transition consists in a high level of uncertainty. A high-risk business environment influences the decisions of MNCs and the patterns of FDI. This idea is not completely new, occurring in neoclassical assumptions and being further developed in more recent theories. However, the choice of FDI location always depends on a preliminary analysis of countries' advantages and disadvantages and their factor analysis. And only on this basis is the MNC's activity encouraged or limited by the actual level of transition achieved in the host country. Therefore, FDI in transition countries can only be fully explained by a combination of classical approaches and transition-specific approaches. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",FDI determinants; Foreign direct investment; Transition,

To test the hypothesis, we applied multiple regression and augmented analysis. Based on the overall results, we concluded as follow. For the LQ45 index of the growth firms in the manufacturing sector of Indonesia, the financing deficit had positive significant effects on net debt and net equity issues, whereas financing deficit had negative significant effects on new retained earnings. For Mature firms, we concluded that the financing deficit had positive significant effects on net debt issue and net equity issues, while financing deficit has negative insignificant effects on new retained earnings. Furthermore, growth and mature firms prefer external to internal financing and debt to equity if external financing is used. Therefore, both growth and mature firms tend to follow the pecking order theory. However, results showed that the pecking order theory described financing patterns of growth firms better than mature firms.

So, buying pigs of over 90 Kg weight is favorably selective. The logistics cost can be reduced with appropriate reserve; reserved 2 pigs per 2-day round, the logistics cost would reduce 15Baht/pig. The implementation of cost reduction and value adding could yield extra profit of 485Baht, or 7.06%, and value added to 12,125Baht within 1-month period.

Leverage behavior of Malaysian manufacturing companies a case observation of the industrial sector's companies in bursa Malaysia,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863094060&partnerID=40&md5=49e8cdcc65f4c7ed405672ada7db4443,"This paper examines the capital structure for the manufacturing companies listed in the Bursa Malaysia market based on data obtained from annual reports of 117 manufacturing companies during a seven-year period from 2004 to 2010. In this study, the determinants of capital structure in Malaysian industrial sector are investigated with reference to major capital structure theories of Pecking Order theory and Trade-off theory. This study utilized quantitative data. Six independent variables were analyzed to measure their effects on debt ratio. In addition, a macro-economic variable was also examined to assess the effect of GDP rate on debt. Multiple regression is run as tool of analysis. The result reveals that among all the possible explanatory variables, only three variables which are tangibility, profitability and liquidity affect the capital structure. The results also indicate that size, growth and risk variables have insignificant effect on leverage ratio. There is no evidence found to support the influence of GDP rate as a macroeconomic indicator on debt ratio. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Capital structure; Leverage ratio; Manufacturing companies,

Therefore, ineffective internal controls may contribute to restatement severity and credit risk. This study first examines the association between restatement severity and internal controls by examining whether the level of internal control quality affects core account restatements. My findings provide evidence that the probability of core account restatements increases in degree of internal control deficiency under among three definitions of internal control quality. Second, this study examines whether internal control quality of restating companies matters for credit risk. Empirical results show that credit rating agencies consider restating companies with material internal weaknesses as higher-risk clients, and thus assign a more unfavorable rating. This result seems to be consistent with rating agencies argue that after SOX they regard internal controls over financial reporting as an important factor in the rating process. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Core account; Credit rating; Internal control; Restatement,

In order to meet the minimum required level, the shareholders request the voting right by buying the stock or collecting the voting right by proxy solicitation. This paper explores the effects of directors re-election on the stock performance and on the souvenir granting. The empirical results show that the abnormal return is negative close to the date of the shareholders' meeting no matter whether there is a directors' re-election or not. Based on the evidence of abnormal return and cumulated abnormal return, the stock performance is correlated negatively with the event of director re-elections in the following two periods two months (record date) and 30 days (shareholder receives the meeting notice) before the annual general meeting. Souvenir granting is negatively but not significantly correlated with accumulated abnormal returns. Although they are not highly correlated, souvenir granting is a special occasion in Taiwan. The empirical test of relationship between souvenir granting and corporate governance shows that the fewer the shares that the insiders own and the less control right the insiders have, the higher is the probability the firms will offer souvenirs at the shareholders' meeting. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Corporate governance; Director re-election; Ownership control; Souvenirs,

According to Banque Mondiale (2010), this external source of finance seems to affect the economic development of recipient countries in the same way as official development aid (ODA) and foreign direct investment (FDI). To achieve this objective, we use the fixed effects panel regression models proposed by Dollar and Kraay (2002), Berg and Krueger (2003), and Jongwanich (2007), as well as a sample of SSA countries to determine the link between WRs and poverty on the one hand, WRs and growth on the other. Considering the specificities of each of the models retained in the present study, recourse to the instrumental variables method turned out to be better for the estimation of the poverty model, while the standard error correction method proved to be well suited for the estimation of the growth model. The empirical results of the study enable us to confirm the ambiguity observed in the literature about the capacity of WRs to give impetus to economic development. Beyond the fact that the coefficient associated with the WRs variable in the poverty model is not significant, the study results indicate that WRs do not contribute significantly to the reduction of poverty. However, it is important to note that WRs seem to be a key element in boosting economic growth in the same manner as investment. Thus, if decision makers allocate a substantial percentage of the fruits derived from this growth to investment in the development of human capital, physical and basic social infrastructures, it is very likely that poverty will be reduced in the long term. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Development; Economic growth; Poverty; Workers' Remittances (WRs),

Shareholder value from sustainability leadership: Comparing valuation ratios within industry groups,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862247369&partnerID=40&md5=992a0c95e432d96256ffd04e98c84a99,"Clear, empirical answers to the general question ""Does it pay to be good?"" have eluded researchers. We argue this stems from widely varied financial metrics used as dependent variables, which tend to fail to distinguish an individual firm's periodic results from trends affecting the overall economy, specific industry, or peer group of comparable companies. In this study, we avoid those weaknesses by focusing on relative valuation, where valuation ratios across relevant peer groups of firms are compared to reflect relative shareholder value per unit of each financial metric. We focus on firms that have been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, as a proxy for sustainability leadership accounting for social, economic, and environmental performance. We then compare valuation metrics between those leading firms and their non-distinguished peers. Sustainability leaders are found to have significantly higher multiples in key valuation ratios, suggesting that investments incurred to attain sustainability leadership are returned in the form of relatively higher valuation. Therefore, shareholder wealth maximization is shown to be associated with sustainability leadership. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Sustainability leadership; Valuation ratios,

Input-output model is a consistency model and it does not deal with the matter of optimal resource allocation. For that reason, there is in need of an optimization technique. In this study, Linear Programming techniques are used, because some applicable economic assumptions give way to express all the sectoral relationships linearly. In this context, it is useful to implement both Input-output analysis and Linear Programming techniques to obtain the most effective and consistent results.

Second, the failure of the conventional single model to explain the momentum and contrarian profits; the strength of these strategies is not built on differences in risk. Finally, partial support of the relationship between momentum and contrarian profits and market states; investors could improve their investment performance by using a momentum strategy when the market state is up and a contrarian strategy when the market state is down.

This study has been undertaken to find out existence of some pattern i.e. persistence among different components of the earnings as well as their sustainability over the period, for future profitability and stock returns. Design/Methodology/Approach: This study uses Pearson correlation matrix at firm's level for correlations between different components of earnings. Random panel (effect) regression model has been used to find the relationships among the earnings' variables and impact of the current components on the future earnings. Seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model has also been used to test the persistence level of different earnings components. Moreover, Random panel (effect) regression model has been used to see any relationship of the components of earnings with the stock prices/returns. Findings: This paper points out that elements of retained earning have significant and positive impact on net future earnings of the firms. Current Accruals (CACC), Retained Cash Flow (RCF) and Distribution to Equity Holders (DISTEH) cause persistently constructive influence on future earnings of the firms because investors anticipate future profitability with reference to available financial resources. However, no significant relation has been found between historical accounting numbers and stock returns. Originality: This paper is an attempt on filling the gap on expected earnings of the firms in Pakistan with reference to their distribution of earnings decisions. As per researcher's knowledge, this paper is a humble beginning on the topic in Pakistan. Analysis provides evidence that firms' accounting results can be used significantly to assess future profitability but not significant relationship with future stock returns. © Euro Journals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Current accruals; Dividend; Net income; Non current accruals; Retained cash flow; Retained earnings,
Estimating insurer's capital requirements through Markov switching models in the solvency II framework,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859085201&partnerID=40&md5=af82ba714163913eb8b0f52d16bb5730,"Solvency II will transform the system for determining capital requirements for insurers. The new regulatory framework proposes a standard model, but at the same time, it encourages the use of internal models of self-evaluation and risk management. The model of normal returns implicit in the calculation of the standard formula may underestimate the tail of the distribution of losses. This could mean the underestimation of the real exposure to the risk and, therefore, the level of capital inherent to this exposure. Other alternatives, widely used in the insurance sector, such as GARCH and EGARCH models may be insufficient to capture the turmoil recently experienced in financial markets. Instead, the current paper proposes the use of Markov switching models as an alternative for equity risk measurement. We have used monthly data from four of the main European indices for the period between January1990 and January 2010 for the calibration and comparison of models. After demonstrating the superiority of the proposed models we estimated the capital shortfall that results from applying the lognormal model implicit in Solvency II or other alternatives that do not consider regime change. The results show that the funds needed address equity risk are dependent on the specification used. Furthermore, capital charge results are substantially higher than those estimated by lognormal models, GARCH and E-GARCH. Therefore, the use of simple models could lead to an underestimation of the actual risk assumed and the calculation of charges below those required. Finally, the use of an internal model as proposed would save capital requirements over the standard model for most of the equity indices. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Capital requirements; Regime switching; Solvency II; Value at risk,

This paper aims to examine the impact of capital structure towards performance of two group of banks, conventional and Islamic banks, by using profit efficiency approach. Two stages procedure were employed. In the first stage we measure profit efficiency score for each bank in Indonesia during year 2002-2008 by using distribution free approach (DFA). In the second stage we employ banks' capital ratio to measure their impact towards their performance. Output from the first stage indicate that bank's average profit efficiency scores equal to 0,60. Whereas the maximum score equal to 0,78. So there is still room around 0,18 Indonesian banks to improve their performance. The output also indicate the Islamic banks in Indonesia succeed to place their position at top 20% highest profit efficiency score. Result from the second stage indicate that bank's capital ratio have a negative effect on their profit efficiency. Futhermore, the negative effect happened to be higher for the Islamic bank group compared to conventional bank. This result consistent with Diamond & Rajan (2001) opinion that higher capital could degrade bank's profit performance. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc.",Capital structure; Conventional bank; Islamic bank; Liquidity; Profit efficiency,

The result suggests that no long-run relationship exist between the energy sources and the per capita real income and domestic price. The short-run dynamics using the VAR analysis suggest that the average income elasticity of gas consumption is positive and higher than petroleum and electricity consumptions, making gas consumption more of a luxury than necessity. The domestic price elasticity remains insignificant for the three energy sources. Furthermore, the result of the variance decomposition suggests that whenever there are shocks to electricity and petroleum consumptions, such shocks come mainly from disturbances in the production or supply of the products and not from domestic price and real income shocks. The differences in the coefficient of elasticity of each component of energy have significant policy implications for income and revenue generation. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",,

The very nature of these new emerging markets necessitates the need for establishing a benchmark for future equity analysis. It is against this backdrop that this paper investigates the sensitivity of sector risk-return relationships in the Saudi Arabian Stock Market. Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the beta and alpha coefficients are calculated and later refined with a rolling regression technique. Results suggest that beta is time variant. Using a static beta measurement without consideration to its relative daily instability, distorted sector-market relationship signals and lead to spurious results. This suggests one should not rely on the traditional beta measurement as a sole guiding investment tool. The contribution of this paper provides a more refined technique, a rolling beta, to accurately capture daily valuation swings caused by market-moving events over time. Subsequently alpha values were calculated using the CAPM and more accurate risk-return valuations were forecasted of future expected outcomes. More robust forecast results emerged identifying four key phases of varying stock market activity (systematic risk) and sector market valuations previously unrecognized when using a static beta model. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Alpha; Beta stability; CAPM; Emerging markets; Rolling beta regression,

Finally, the traditional proxy of information asymmetry, the firm size, shows insignificant correlation with the effect of BES and ROI on returns.

A second approach introduced primarily by the central banks tries to define this concept starting from the various properties of a stable financial system. However, the formulation of an operational definition remains conditioned by the installation of an analytical framework which must delimit the field of intervention of the responsible authorities, define the instruments and the transmission channels of the adopted decisions and specify the indicator of measurement making it possible to evaluate this function. The traditional functions of the central banks such as the management of the liquidity, the banking supervision and the control of the monetary policy confer to them a central role in the maintenance of financial stability. In the same way, their interventions successful at the time of financial crises enabled them to acquire an expertise on the matter. Thus, one attends an increased role of the central banks in this field, according to various methods and within devices associating generally various actors (Government and regulation and supervision authority). © Euro Journals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Financial regulation and bank run; Financial stability; Macro stress test; Systemic risk,

The analysis of the relation between earnings volatility and earnings predictability relies on commonly used autoregressive regressions of current on one-year lagged earnings. To examine the role of lagged earnings components (CFO and accruals) to predicting current earnings, this paper also regressing current earnings on one-year lagged operating cash flows and accruals: To alleviate concerns about a mechanical relation, this paper uses predetermined measures of volatility (i.e., standard deviation) to partition the data into volatility quartiles and then use data to estimate earnings predictability. This paper uses a test based on simulating the empirical distribution of the adjusted R2s and persistence coefficients in quartiles. Consistent with existing literature, results show that, earnings, cash from operations and accruals volatility and earnings persistence are negatively related to earnings predictability. Also, results show that while the volatility of earnings, cash from operations and accruals are increased, the role of earnings, cash from operations and accruals in predicting future earnings are declined. Finally, results show that, while predictive horizon increase, earnings predictability decrease gradually. Survey evidence indicates widely held managerial beliefs that earnings and its components volatility are negatively related to earnings predictability. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc.",Accruals; Cash from operations; Earnings volatility: earnings predictability,

The traditional capital structure theories have a pro-cyclical implication both for the level and adjustment process of firms' capital structure. Similarly, if global capital market integration effectively and substantially eliminates arbitrage opportunity, then, the pay-off for US-based MNCs seeking financing in the international capital markets under varying domestic macroeconomic conditions could only come at a marginal cost. The empirical results revealed that macroeconomic factors have significant influence on firms' financing decisions; however, the impact is statistically different for MNCs relative to DCs. Importantly, the results shows strong evidence of relatively faster adjustment for MNCs than DCs.

The paper employs different univariate specifications of the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) model, including both symmetric and asymmetric models. An application of the GARCH (1,1) model provides strong evidence of the persistence of time varying volatility. By allowing the mean equation of the returns series to depend on a function of the conditional variance, the results provide evidence of the existence of a positive risk premium, which supports the positive correlation hypothesis between volatility and the expected stock returns. Furthermore, the asymmetric GARCH models show a significant evidence for asymmetry in stock returns, confirming the presence of leverage effect in the returns series. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",GARCH models; Leverage effects; Returns volatility; Saudi stock market; Volatility clustering,

Applying several tests of random walk, the results conclusively reveal that stock prices on the DSE do not follow the random walk model, and hence, the weak form efficiency of the DSE is rejected. Unlike most of the research conducted in emerging markets, the findings are not driven by thin trading as this was taken into account when conducting the tests. The fact that the DSE is inefficient in the weak form has very profound implications for investors' choices of investment strategies and for policy makers. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.","Autocorrelation test; Damascus securities exchange; GARCH (1, 1); Random walk; Runs test; Unit root test; Variance ratio test; Weak form market efficiency",

The system of equation also shows that the impact of FDI on domestic investment is stronger than the role of domestic investment in attracting FDI. Similarly, OLS techniques confirmed that FDI complements domestic investment, particularly private investment.

Determinants of growth for Thai mutual fund industry,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859028893&partnerID=40&md5=77ecf1e4470e588e8884d2a237aea26f,"Thai mutual funds industry has grown drastically and become an alternative channel of savings and investment in the past five years, from 2006 to 2010, particularly as real deposit interest rates remain in negative territory. At present, the country's assets under mutual fund management equal Bt1.704 trillion, or around 37 per cent of total household bank savings. Proportion of equity funds to total assets under management of the industry rose from approximately 10 percent to 15 percent. Fixed income funds play an important role determining industry growth. It is therefore essential that all stakeholders in the capital market, especially investors, understand the nature of the mutual fund industry, both in terms of the variety of products and services, and the real advantages it offers. It is especially important when Thai capital market is approaching more financial liberalization in 2015. Three determinants of mutual funds growth besides funds performance are distribution channel, reputation of parent company, and administrative expenses. Therefore, asset management companies with better distribution channel or better access to clients through a bank's nationwide branches and with more efficient complete financial services from their parent companies leading to more efficient cost management have higher growth opportunities. Possessing the three determinants, a company can grab bigger market shares in both the fixed income fund sector and the equity/stock funds sector through crossselling, even though it may charge clients comparatively higher fees with a lower rate of return (data compiled in 2008 and June 2010). Thai mutual fund industry is likely to face two major challenges. Firstly, due to limited mutual fund product diversification and slow product development, especially if foreign-owned asset management companies, which focus more on product innovation, lose their competitive edge and ultimately leave the business. Secondly, Thai mutual funds may become too concentrated on simple short-term funds, which benefit from tax privileges relative to bank deposits. However, given the challenge of Thailand's ageing society, which will need savings and investment with high long-term returns, relying on these types of product will not enable us to meet the future burden. Therefore, it may be time for stakeholders in Thai capital market start asking how they can help develop the mutual fund industry to serve Thai investors in a more efficient way. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc.",Asset management corporation; Bank related; Growth determinants; Mutual funds; Tax benefit,

The analysis support that the concentration of managerial ownership affects the firms financial policies, mainly the leverage and dividend policies. The empirical analysis find out that leverage policy variable influenced managerial ownership negatively, supporting that the lower leverage level leads to high profitability firms engage in low managers' ownership program. The result also determines a negative and significant association among the mangers ownership concentration and dividend policy of the firms. This result is supported by the agency theory prediction suggesting that as a firm has high managerial ownership, the asymmetric information will decrease and directly decrease the effectiveness of the dividend policy. Beside this the firms with higher managerial ownership decrease their perquisites, so the conflict between manager's shareholders can be settled. It is also observed that the managers' ownership concentration in general has a positive relationship with the performance in the corporate culture of Pakistan, where major firms are the family oriented. When the managerial ownership is divided in three levels, low level (0 -5%), moderate level (5%-25% and high concentrated (above 25%), the performance positively affect only at low and moderate level.

To model longevity risk, this study used data from Japan, the Asian nation with the highest life expectancy and UK, the highest life expectancy rate in Europe. A variety of measures were used to compare the models; the Bayesian information criterion was used to measure the parsimony of the models, and parameter estimation was used to evaluate the robustness of the models between different fitting periods. The results show that our proposed model is a promising approach in mortality modeling, producing empirical results that can greatly inform the insurance industry and governmental policies. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Cairns-blake-dowd model; Lee-carter model; Longevity risk; Renshaw and haberman model,

This paper discussed few of these univariate time series forecasting models and their application for forecasting cement productions in India. Applying monthly data spreading over April 1993 to March 2011, on productions of cement in lakh tons, the forecasting performance of various competing models is evaluated through forecast accuracy criteria such as mean absolute percent error (MAPE), mean squared deviation (MSD) etc. Among these models Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model performs better than other competing models in forecasting cement productions. It provides lowest MAPE value. In fact, the model has also an advantage over other models as it explicates autoregressive and moving average process the data along with seasonality. Therefore, as a policy implication, SARIMA model can be used for forecasting cement productions in India. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Cement; Forecasting models; SARIMA model; Seasonality; Smoothing,

A sample of 2241firm-year observations from Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) companies during the period 2002 to 2007 is used. Discretionary accruals (DAC) is employed as representative of audit quality. The cross-sectional version of Jones' model modified by Kothari et al. (2005) is applied to measure DAC. Results show that financial statements audited by governmental auditors contain smaller discretionary accruals than those audited by private audit firms do. Furthermore, a change from governmental auditor to private auditors is associated with larger discretionary accruals, suggesting that governmental auditors provide superior audits. Finally, the size of non-governmental audit firms does not affect their audit quality, and changes within private audit firms do not lead to changes in the level of discretionary accruals. The empirical results imply that in some settings such as Iran's, factors including auditor type, intense competition, audit committee, and litigation risk are of greater importance than auditor size.

The presence of relationships between firms and banks is expected to increase the possibility of firm restructuring activities because of useful and timely advice from their close banks. In the pre-crisis period, the probability of dividend cut is higher among bank-connected firms than non-connected firms; during the crisis, top management turnover appears to be the restructuring strategy adopted by connected firms. In the post-crisis period, however, connected firms are less likely to undertake debt restructuring actions, which are mainly driven by a lower incidence of financial advisor appointments. Nevertheless, we find no strong evidence that bank relationships add value to the firms because changes in performance after undertaking restructuring activities are not significantly different between connected and non-connected firms.

In symmetric market condition, which relationship between risk and yield is direct (Sharp 1964), they go toward full risk investment. because they can gain more profit with more risk, and they also have less consideration to investment in no risk part, but when market is asymmetric, which relationship between risk and yield is unclear (Estrada 2002), risking investors go toward no risk investments (short time investment). © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Asymmetric market; Financial behavior; Limit rationality theory; Rational theory; Symmetric market,
Post merger financial performance: A study with reference to select manufacturing companies in India,2012,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84856807848&partnerID=40&md5=7df36016841adb37895075de0fe12539,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are the inorganic growth strategies which have got its significance in today's corporate world due to intensely competitive business environment. The present paper intends to study the trend in merger and acquisition (M&A) particularly with reference to manufacturing companies. While M&A is considered as one of the strategies for growth, the companies are expected to perform post M&A so that those are proved successful. From the literature review it is found that there is no conclusive evidence about the impact of M&A on corporate performance. Moreover in recent period M&A deals have gone up manifold and regulations relevant for M&A have also undergone change. Hence there is a need to look into the trend of M&A and the post M&A performance of companies. The present study is an attempt to find out the difference in post merger performance compared with pre merger in terms of profitability, liquidity and solvency. The scope of the study is limited to manufacturing sector companies in India. The statistical tools used are descriptive statistics, paired sample t-test. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Acquisitions; Financial Performance; Mergers,
An empirical estimation of the contribution of energy saving systems (ESS) toward cost reduction and efficiency: Productivity improvement in thracian SME'S,2011,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-83455236097&partnerID=40&md5=28ffa6fb8ecc437bb0be7780802c54af,"In this paper we present an empirical investigation of the contribution of Energy Saving Systems (ESS), introduced by ten manufacturing firms, towards the reduction of energy costs and improvement of competitiveness. The ten firms chosen for this study belong to high and medium energy-intensive industries; their expenditure on energy is, at least, 25% of their total production costs. We collected the necessary data and information through a questionnaire, and using the simple ""function of marginal cost"" we defined the contribution of ESS, as a special investment, to efficient energy use. The contribution of ESS, was found equal to 36.8%(in average), a very significant percentage which results in 6.36% lower production costs and respectively lower prices, passed onto the consumer. Despite the significant contribution of ESS to energy efficiency, some firms claim that they invest in ESS not only for cost reduction, but also for a number of other reasons: a) 70% of firms invest in ESS due to the existing incentives or capital subsidies for such investments in the region of Thrace - they are equal to 65% of invested cost (energy paradox), b) 30% invest in ESS to gain cost-competitiveness and higher total energy productivity through the efficient use of energy. The final conclusions of this work are: 1.those manufacturing firms with high energy costs can achieve a profit as a result of investments in ESS, since they yield great energy savings; 2. On occasion, and regarding the energy saving issue-energy paradox, business decisions appear to be irrational; 3. New technologies have provided many opportunities in industry for further improvements in efficient use of energy. © Euro Journals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Energy efficiency; Energy productivity; Energy saving systems; Function; Marginal cost,

The study finds evidence that interest rate futures react to the news component of target rate announcements across the maturity spectrum, with a stronger reaction evident in short maturity futures. There is evidence of an asymmetric news effect whereby interest rate futures have a stronger reaction to unexpected rate rises, than to unexpected rate cuts. The study finds that the RBA target rate announcements resolve uncertainty in interest rate futures, and this effect has intensified following the December 2007 change in RBA communication policy. © Euro Journals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Financial Markets; Interest Rate Futures; RBA; Target Rate News,

Classical NPV uses only crisp and certain data about investment projects. The output, a crisp number, gives the value an investment project adds to the company. On the other hand, there is imprecision and uncertainty about future of a project. This paper deals quantitatively with imprecision or uncertainty of these projects by using fuzzy set theory that is concerned with vagueness in human thoughts. As an alternative to conventional NPV, this paper proposed fuzzy Net Present Value (FNPV) that uses triangular fuzzy numbers instead of a crisp number.

We find that a company's green score and its stock price are significantly negatively related. Because the cost of keeping green may adversely affect a company's profitability, investors appear to be willing to pay a lower price for green company stocks compared with nongreen company stocks. Since the goal of a company's financial management is to maximize its stock price, our results in this study indicate that there is no market incentive for U.S. companies to go green. The policy implication of our finding is that federal, state, and local tax incentives may be needed to encourage U.S. companies to go green and to keep green. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Environmental impact; Green policy; Green score; Multivariate regression; Stock price,

It was expected that the stock price behavior of the IPOs in the aftermarket will be affected accordingly. The primary empirical findings could be summarized as follows: First, as expected, the magnitude of the average short-term excess returns is reduced. Second, as expected, the percentage of the IPOs with a transaction price at the end of a certain period of listing falling below the listing price was increased. Third, again as expected, the number of transaction days needed for reaching the equilibrium price was shortened.

The declining trends of poverty during the periods of 70's and 80's were reversed in 90's. These ever changing trends of poverty reveal the inconsistent and unsuitable policies for poverty reduction in Pakistan. The aim of the present study is to analyze the determinants of rural poverty by using simple regression model. The study is based on primary data sets. The main purpose of the study is to analyze the impact of various socioeconomic and demographic variables on economic status of rural households. Poverty has been measured in terms of per capita income and wealth index. The Wealth Index (WI) is constructed from the household survey conducted for the present analysis. It is concluded that the number of earners, school going children, number of rooms, room per member, source of drinking water, number of children, number of females, per month income of households have significant positive impact on the wealth of a household. The results suggest that poverty can be alleviated by improving wealth status of rural households in real term by providing better health, education and employment opportunities both for males and females in rural areas. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",Pakistan; Per Capita Income; Regression analysis; Rural Poverty; Wealth Index,

Using a sample of 1,190 contractual alliances of two US companies, we find that about 46 percent of the sample exhibit positive CAR for a partner and negative for the other partner. Relatively speaking, wealth transfers more frequently from the larger partner to the smaller. We ascribe this phenomenon to partnering companies' opportunistic behavior. Further, we find that the wealth transfer effect is associated with alliance attributes. The greater the difference in size between the partners, the more likely the presence of wealth transfer from the larger partner to the smaller. When the partners operate in related industries, there is a lower likelihood to appear the wealth transfer effect from the smaller partner to the larger. Surprisingly, we find that investors are less likely to give positive valuations of both partners in technical-oriented alliances. Finally, we show that the larger partner in a technical-oriented alliance tends to have lower CAR at the announcement and the smaller partner shows greater CAR when it has a very small size relative to its counterpart partner. These results can be explained by the smaller partner's opportunistic manner and increase in visibility. © Euro Journals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Opportunistic Behavior; Strategic Alliances; Wealth Transfer Effect,

Sales are an important key to success for revenue generation and for this purpose various marketing strategies have been developed. Sales are always driven by customers/consumers, and this thought is in practice since the inception of the concept of business. This paper is an appreciation on the comprehension of various marketing strategies (i.e. Single Segment Strategy, Differentiated Strategy, Un Differentiated Strategy, Product Development, Establishing The Brand, Innovation strategy, Market Growth Shares, Porter Cost Leadership, Market Expansion, Pricing, Diversification), which only aim at generating revenues while proposing the Tobit model to assess the relationships of outlined various marketing strategies with the revenue generation (sales of the products/ services). The comprehensive findings of this research reveals that all strategic means are important for generating revenues in relevance to the products/ services which are being offered and confirms that all outlined marketing strategies are designed and configured with the intent to grab the money from every pocket, but single segment strategy and market growth share strategy matter the most in this connections.

Identity and self image are factors that motivate individuals to become terrorists but the gains and losses in identity and self image that result from engagement in terrorism are payoffs to terrorism.

According to the results of the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), the inefficiency of our domestic banking subsidiaries was mainly attributed to the lack of technical efficiency. Results from 2007 showed 11 banks delivering increasing or constant returns to scale, which indicated that there remained much room for domestic financial holding companies to expand the scale of their banking operations. Furthermore, an analysis based on the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) showed that all 11 banking subsidiaries had progressively improved in terms of overall efficiency, scale efficiency, and overall productivity. Based on the results of the analysis, we recommended all banking subsidiaries operating under a financial holding structure to adopt modern information technologies (IT), broaden their business varieties, enhance internal control and supervision, and thereby achieving both economies of scope and scale.

However, the risk to banks' activities was the major factor in the risk of bank failure in Cameroon. We note also that if the probability of bank failure due to insufficient capital is zero between 1998 and 2006, period of high stability of the banking system, it is not that due to the exposure of banks the risk of their activities.

Housing affordability and methodological principles: An application,2011,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-83455211814&partnerID=40&md5=72c10727cce78230002ea843505f67fe,"Housing affordability has become a key theme of housing policy against the background of the subprime mortgage crisis and the need to reduce fiscal subsidies. The aim of this research was to develop an approach of banking credit participation during the realization of method able to assess housing affordability. The method was developed in order to deal with the real purchasing capacity of households, taking into account existing bank structures and the procurement of housing loans, as well as to assess the potential demand for mortgage lending as a promising area of banking. Assessment can be made by considering the conditions of housing loans from the largest banks and statistical information on the income of the population, together with information from real estate agencies about the current level of prices in the housing market. The approach proposed could be useful for the authorities, when determining the content of housing policy, as it provides an opportunity to identify more effective ways of solving the housing problem through a comprehensive assessment of housing needs and opportunities for the banking system to engage in lending. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Affordability index; Housing; Loans; Mortgages; Real estate,

Reliable and accurate prediction of firm failure is an important issue for financial analysts and in general for whole economy. In this respect, the consideration of firm failure is an important element in financial activities. Because of the importance of this subject a large number of studies using parametric and non-parametric models have been studied in finance literature. In this study a non-parametric classification method namely classification and regression tree (CART) is used to classify the successful and unsuccessful firms, in other words firm failure.

Moreover, as the regulated price of not-for-profit service increases, an NPO could still over-compensate his manager in regard to profit, when the indirect effect on increasing preference difference between the owner and manager of the NPO dominates the direct effect on market price.

Using pooled and cross-sectional regressions, the results are consistent with prior empirical research conducted in other developed countries in that the association between MV/BV and ROE is positive for positive ROE and negative for negative ROE. Failure to take the sign of ROE into consideration affects negatively the value relevance of ROE even after controlling for firm size, industry, and GDP growth. The association is much improved for industrial firms when taking the sign of ROE into consideration compared with service firms, and the same improvement is documented for high and low GDP growth periods. Furthermore, the relation is affected positively by the size of the firm with or without taking the sign of ROE into consideration; the association is significantly stronger for larger firms and became even stronger when taking the sign of ROE into consideration. Moreover, it's been found that distinguishing positive ROE from negative ROE is essential especially for small firms, industrial firms, and during periods of low GDP growth rates. The model which includes ROE and fails to distinguish between positive and negative ROEs for those sub-samples has no, or near to zero, explanatory power which may lead to erroneous conclusions about the rule of ROE in the valuation process of firms had the sign of ROE not been taken into consideration. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Firm size; GDP; Jordan; Market-to-book ratio; Negative(ROE); Positive ROE; Return on equity (ROE),

Financial leverage, tangible assets, profitability and liquidity are the firm characteristics where the market estimators are more likely to diverge in classifying firms into market outperformers and underperformers. Furthermore, firm size, R&D expenses and free cash flow show no difference with all market estimators. Moreover, the computationally costly Qpw estimator is preferable over the simple Qcp estimator and market-to-book ratio during an economic instability. However, Q-estimators in general are less sensitive to market-level factors than market-to-book ratio, and therefore they are more appropriate when one evaluates a firm's market valuation from internal prospective. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Capital structure; Market valuation; Tobin's Q,

To accomplish that, a non-parametric model has been derived by using the monthly changes in some specific macroeconomic indicators between the years 1999 and 2009 in the light of the report published by OECD including the risk ratings of 210 countries. 93, 0 % of all the observations can be classified correctly with the established feed-forwarding neural network model consisting of only one hidden layer while the correct classification rate has increased up to 98,5 % for the terms with improved conditions. We conclude that the Real Exchange Rate Index among the variables found to be significant in the model has caused a reverse effect on country risk level so, the index changes in favor of Turkish Lira are reflected positively to the country's view. Expectedly, we have also observed that country risk level decreases as a result of the increases in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) whereas an increasing trend in the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) has been matched with a parallel trend in country risk. In addition, the observed direct relationship between country risklevel and the external liabilities of the central bank can be explained with the phenomena that ascending volumes of external liabilities could be regarded as a good signal of country's improved credibility and that Turkey has an economy which has been dependent mainly on external sources and majorly financed with external debt. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Artificial neural networks; Country risk determinants; Macroeconomic indicators; Non-parametric models,

In 2011 the direct and indirect contribution of the Greek tourism industry to total GDP and employment is expected to reach 15.8% and 18.4% respectively (WTTC, 2011). The objective of this paper is to analyse the role of tourism in the Greek economic growth. We use a trivariate model of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), international tourist arrivals and real effective exchange rate to investigate the relationship between tourism and economic growth. By using annual data for Greece for the period of 1960-2010, our results reveal that there is a cointegrating relationship between tourism and economic growth. However, contrary to the literature our results using Granger Causality Test based on Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) indicate that there is no directional impact between tourism and GDP growth in Greece. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Cointegration; Economic growth; Greece; Tourism arrivals; Vecm,

In this article, model misspecification results from the degree of ambiguity about the probability laws for asset returns. Optimal investment strategies under model misspecification not only depend on the market portfolio, the liability hedge portfolio, the risk-free asset and the state variables hedge portfolio, but also rely on the level of ambiguity for asset returns. The liability hedge portfolio is independent of the preference and dependent on the current funding ratio and the level of ambiguity for asset returns. Numerical applications demonstrate how the level of ambiguity for asset returns influences the optimal portfolio choice; the higher the funding ratio, the lesser need for liabilities hedge. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Funding ratio; Hedge portfolio; Model misspecification; Surplus management,

By applying the MF-DFA method we first calculate the generalized Hurst exponents and we then deduce the Rényi exponents as well as the singularity spectrum of the MASI and MADEX indices. Furthermore, we perform the shuffling and the phase-randomization techniques to detect the sources of the multifractality. We show that there are two major sources of multifractality, the long-range temporal correlations and the fat-tail distribution. We show notably that the first source contributes mainly to the multifractality of MASI index while the two sources contribute almost equally to the multifractality of the MADEX index. By comparing the multifractal behavior of the MASI and MADEX indices we find finally that the first one exhibits a richer multifractal feature than the second one. This permits us to conclude that the greater is the stock market the more complex is the dynamics of the stock market index representing all of the market, which is traduced by richer multifractal behavior of this index.

In this paper it was shown that there are ordinary cases when there may be many efficient prices depending on types of participants operating on a market. In other words, efficiency should be a relative conception. Differences of interests were investigated on foreign exchange market, share market, and money market. Existence of different efficient prices allows making excess profit, what means that market is not in the equilibrium state. However, differences between interests are often fundamental and equilibrium state corresponds to the extremely stable environment. Thus, relativity is connected to market self-stabilization properties: interacting with each other participants are trying to prevent price changes. Obtained indispensable conditions allow making generalization to a broader context. It was shown that changeability and uncertainty of environment combined with individuality of agents allow latter to achieve their individual aims independently from prices. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Efficiency; Equilibrium; Game theory; Pricing; Relativity; Stabilization,

An ecosystem is a biological term which refers an environment consisting of all the organisms living in a particular area, as well as all the nonliving, physical components of the environment with which the organisms interact, such as air, soil, water and sunlight. An innovation ecosystem consists of economic agents and economic relations as well as the non-economic parts such as technology, institutions, sociological interactions and the culture. Non-economic components or innovation structure can enable idea making, introducing innovation and diffusion of them. A highly developed innovation ecosystem helps participants to operate beyond firm boundaries, enable to transformation of knowledge into innovation. In this study innovation ecosystems are analyzing in three components. First component of the ecosystem is state of cluster development. Cluster is geographic concentration of interconnected firms, suppliers and institutions in a particular industry. One of the objectives of clusters is driving innovation in that industry. Clusters enablecumulative knowledge formation. Furthermore clustering firms extract qualified labor. Cluster development has strongly positive effect on innovation events.

The author takes the position that-among all other obstacles confronting her-lack of accountability and transparency is the greatest drawback preventing Nigeria from fulfilling her potential. According to him, although corruption is not peculiar to Nigeria alone, Nigeria's situation is unique because unlike most other progressive societies, the country has yet to put in place a credible infrastructure for enforcing anti-corruption laws. And even if Nigeria succeeded in institutionalizing a strong anti-corruption legislature, it will not be ""fully liberated"" from the ""corruption chokehold"" until law enforcement is backed by credible reforms targeted at improving the economic and social conditions of majority underprivileged Nigerians. The paper is based on domestically and internationally sourced data. It consists of surveys polled from grassroots experiences and perceptions of people directly affected, thus suggesting evidence of originality and validity. It vividly illustrates the implications of corruption in the Nigerian society and underscores the urgency of resolution.

The new role of the corporate treasurer: Emerging trends in response to the financial crisis,2011,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-81355135737&partnerID=40&md5=29b3dae3a7ac0d07f76339f09fbb4c75,"This paper discusses the role of the modern corporate treasurer in a multinational company and its transformation in response to current challenges companies and treasurers face. The most significant incident driving change in the role of the corporate treasurer is the credit crisis that occurred in 2007-2009. The crisis replaced a focus on earnings with a focus on cash and liquidity, and marked the end of easy availability of cash for most corporates and the beginning of a situation in which the financial markets were no longer able to reliably supply corporate demand for financing. The crisis saw the end of a credit expansion initiated in the 1980s by the deregulation of the financial markets. Increased focus on liquidity and financial risk management changed the role of the treasurer dramatically. During the crisis, many sectors of the markets totally ceased to function, e.g. the ability to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposures was constrained for certain emerging markets and certain structured securities, such as Auction Rate Securities, became wholly illiquid. These disruptions led to an inability to hedge, manage liquidity or even properly measure certain risks any longer. Embedded risks - e.g., in vendor and customer contracts - also emerged as a critical focus and corporations were forced to take a broader view of risk in light of weaknesses and risks exposed by the crisis. As a result of these changes, treasury is no longer merely a function for cash management, funding and hedge accounting. Treasury is now a strategic function securing liquidity and understanding the true risk profile of the corporation. The treasurer is now much more involved in the management of the business and has become a business leader instead of an administrator. This transformation in role has placed a much higher demand on the skill sets of the treasurer and he or she must command the arts of communication and sales as any business area manager would. While the changing role of the treasurer resulted in new requirements, multinational companies maintained their focus on efficiency - particularly in response to the economic downturn. Yet executive managers and treasurers must not concentrate solely on cost savings, as this would fail to recognize and prioritize critical strategic benefits such as improved quality, resiliency and scope of work. As Treasury has become a strategic role, the legacy operational mandate has lessened in importance but Treasury must still determine the optimal organizational structure that meets both strategic goals and supports overall efficiency. In optimizing the organization of roles, treasurers and business leaders must also consider multicultural and other barriers - in many countries, ""custom and practice"" inhibit ""pure"" efficiencies that might be achieved via centralization or even regionalization. Further, an excessive focus on ""rationalization"" of functions can fail to attract and motivate key and highly qualified specialists required for critical knowledge centers, such as treasury departments. While a purely centralized model may, on the surface, appear optimal due to enhanced control and efficiency, competing factors that argue for local structures make it difficult for treasurers to determine the optimal balance between centralization, regionalization and locally sourced activities. Thus, treasurers must explicitly assess multinational organizational structures at the same time they face an expanding and more complex set of responsibilities. The ideas in our paper optimally apply to multinational companies operating in global environments that present challenges in language barriers and different time zones across the globe. While the paper has direct applicability for financial and treasury managers, the text also holds larger insights for any strategic manager at a complex, multinational organization. It addresses: · The change in the role of the treasurer resulting from the change in financial markets' functionality and the new restrictions in cash availability and risk hedging introduced during the credit crisis. This includes new strategies for cash and liquidity management. · The process of optimal centralization and segregation of operational duties across regional centers, a single global centre at the headquarters, and local units. We will show that centralization cannot be a theoretical construct, but must take into consideration regulation, local conventions and the identity and morale of the workforce. · Factors to consider when identifying optimal locations for regional centers. · The role of outsourcing in meeting emerging challenges while optimizing efficiency and organizational structure. While the challenges faced by the largest multinational corporations are complex, pressure on greater efficiency applies to mid-size companies too, and small to mid-size enterprises (e.g., those with less than 1 billion Euro annual turnover) may access additional competencies and improve efficiency by removing the process out of the company entirely. The article will help those companies evaluate what to outsource and how to choose a provider of outsourcing. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Assets and liabilities management; Cash management; Centralization of treasury; Corporate treasury management; Efficiency; Financial risk management; Standardization,

On the other hand, firm characteristics are firm size, profitability, debt level, growth, risk, industry type and tangibility. The sources used to collect the data for this study are the Forecasting Analysis and Modelling Environment (FAME) database and annual reports. Multiple regression model is used to analyze the data. Based on the sample of 90 non-financial UK companies, it is found that corporate governance factors do affect the dividend policy.

We further show that, among the set of performance measures examined, Kataoka's Safety First (KSF) measures are the most efficient in increasing the weight of the risk component as a determinant of performance. In addition, we introduce a new type of performance measure that provides close ranking approximations of mean-extended Gini-based performance measures, but is simpler to calculate for practical purposes.

In the study, a survey form containing the close-ended question as a data collecting means has been used. The used data have been obtained by talking face to face to the individuals utilizing banking services. The obtained data have been explained by using statistical packaged software and evaluating at the significance level of 95 %. When analyzing data, the frequency distribution has been overviewed to summarize the sample characteristics with numerical presentation and to arrange data, and the average and standard deviation of the scale has been overviewed to identify attitudes of the individuals utilizing bank services for the level of significance placed on the opinions of the customers' choices. In consequence of statistical evaluation of data; it has been found out that the factors such as making customized applications in the bank services and providing installment by the customer have high level of impact amongst the factors having impact on preference of the customer. A hypothesis has been established to determine whether such factors having impact on customers' bank choice differ according to the demographical characteristics of them. The hypothesis has been tested by applying Mann-Whitney U ve Kruskal-Wallis H statistical tests. As a result, the statistically significant differences have been identified between the demographical characteristics of the individuals attending this study and the factors having impact on individuals' bank choices. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Banking; Banking products; Consumer choice,

One of the most important of these changes is the emergence of new financial/banking conglomerates from the mergers of various savings banks and their transformation into IPSs (Institutional Protection Systems). Therefore, determining the value of these financial conglomerates and shares in these is of great interest. This study proposes a scheme which combines the multiple criteria AHP method with the valuation ratio of the International Valuation Standards. This new methodology can be seen as a comparative method or market approach and it only requires a limited number of comparable companies, with their corresponding qualitative and quantitative variables. For this study this valuation method has been applied to the de facto mergers of savings banks. Due to the current situation of the industry, the valuation of financial institutions of this type is a task of great interest and this also serves to showcase the strengths of the proposed methodology. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",AHP; Banking conglomerates; Business valuation; Market value; Multiple criteria analysis; Valuation ratio,

Chi-square and Gamma test were applied to measure the extent and direction of relationship between the study variables. From the analysis, it was concluded that large family size, low income, low level of parents' education, and unemployed adults in family are the main reasons of child labour. The empirical findings indicate that all the respondents were male who belonged to the urban areas, having large family size with a number of unemployed adults. It was also found that parents who were illiterate and were working as labourers mostly impose labour on their children. In this respect both government and non-government organizations should take some concrete steps for raising awareness among parents who force them to work during their school going age, provision of education for children, and equitable employment opportunities should be adopted to control the menace of child labour. © Euro Journals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Causes; Child labour; High population growth; Illiteracy etc; Poverty,

First, bank mergers are more scale and allocative efficiencies comparing with non-mergers, whereas there are no gains of the technical and cost efficiencies by mergers. Second, by the decomposition of cost efficiency, technical inefficiency is the principal cause of cost increases. Finally, no matter M&As or not, the majority of banks are operating at increasing returns to scale, indicating that scale economies can be obtained by increasing production scale. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Cost efficiency; Data Envelopment Analysis; Mergers and acquisitions; Returns to scale,

To test reliability in the target prices calculations we investigate if the method and the parameters of the evaluation report are clearly disclosed and if the procedure is according to the theoretical conventions. Our research results provides preliminary evidences that Portuguese Investment Firms financial reports answer the main questions address by the Jenkins Report, and are for that reason able to deliver the information reports users need.

This paper utilizes a unique data set collected prior to the launch of extensive privatization programs in the Egyptian public sector to examine effects of competition in pay setting on wages in public and private establishments. Using earnings functions estimate for male and female wage workers, decomposition techniques show that gender-based pay discrimination is small in the public sector. In contrast, pure rent premia to men is quite high, by international standards in the private sector. These estimates are robust to the inclusion of non-wage estimates in the calculation. Estimates based on quantile regressions show that public sector wage premia exist only at the lower level of the wage distribution, and gender-based pay discrimination is highest in the private sector for the low waged unskilled workers and higher wage groups in technical and managerial positions. These findings highlight the need to reform pay policy in the government and the expected disproportionate impact of privatisation and civil service reform on women. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Egypt; Gender Wage gaps; Quantile regressions; Wage decomposition; Wage differentials,

This paper examines the pass through from commodity prices to consumer price index (CPI) for an emerging country, namely, Turkey. As a result of analysis, we have two main findings. First, it is estimated that a 10% increase in the price of oil results in a 0.3% increase in CPI, a 10% increase in the price of copper results in a 0.6% increase in CPI and finally a 10% increase in the price of wheat results in a 1.2% increase in CPI. Second, the half-life of oil is 1 month, the halflife of copper is 4 months and the half-life of wheat is 7 months. Thus, the price of oil has the fastest pass-through and the price of wheat has the slowest pass-through to inflation. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Commodity prices; Consumer price index; Emerging country; Pass-through the views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the central bank of the republic of Turkey,

The results show that the Residual Income model can, to a significant degree, capture cross-sectional variation in stock market price of the sample over a significant period of time. However, the model is considered a valuation model. Therefore we propose two ways to determine firm performance. The first is use the first difference from the Residual Income model with correction for dividend namely first difference between Vt and Vt-1 (adding back dividend at time t) represents firm performance. The second is based on the argument that the actual value created in a certain period of time consists of earnings (including dividend) over and above the cost of capital employed, which is the Residual Income Component (RIC) of the Residual income model. These two performance models were empirically tested and compared.

The estimated results are as follows. All equations are not fit since all variables cannot explain the dependent variables significantly. Since there are three equations, we try to estimate these equations using simultaneous equations approach. The results indicate that all equations are almost efficient and our findings suggest that LEVERAGE and PROFIT are statistically significant in determining DISCLOSURE. Meanwhile, the result also suggests that DISCLOSURE and PROFIT are significant in explaining LEVERAGE. For the last equation which treats PROFIT as an endogenous variable, shows that DISCLOSURE is significant in explaining PROFIT among samples of Islamic banks. Furthermore, we have conducted the Granger-Causality test to check the endogeneity and exogeneity among the variables.

On the other hand, the case in developing countries such as including Indonesia is relatively less explored. This research investigates cash dividend payoff behavior of firms listed at Indonesia Capital Market (IDX), using panel data of year 2001- 2008. The study shows that more firms at IDX did not pay dividend than the others that pay dividend. There is a significant difference of characteristics between them. It was further found that the pattern of dividend payment followed the pattern of earning. Moreover, the influence of dividend value paid in previous period is greater than the influence of earning in the current period on dividend payment. Based on changes of dividend value per share, it was found that dividend payment to be unstable and the payout ratio target is relatively high. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Dividend payment stability; Dividend policy; Panel data; Payout ratio target,

We use of monthly Index of Industrial Production (IIP) and quarterly Gross Domestic Production (GDP) data for the time span of April, 1996 to March, 2009. This provides rich data for the empirical analysis. We undertake; Unit root (ADF, PP and KPSS) tests, Granger Causality test, Engle-Granger Cointegration test and Error Correction Model. The monthly results of Granger causality test suggest that there is a bidirectional relationship between IIP and Stock prices (BSE and NSE) and quarterly results reveal that there is no relationship between GDP and BSE but in the case of NSE and GDP there is a unidirectional relationship and that runs from GDP to NSE. The Engle-Granger residual based cointegration test suggests that there is a long-run relationship between the stock market performance and economic growth. Similarly, the results of error correction model reveal that when the long-run equilibrium deviates then the economic growth adjusts to restore equilibrium by rectifying the disequilibrium.

Currency flexibility and real output volatility: Evaluating the credibility of Zimbabwe's exchange rate policies,2011,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80053168066&partnerID=40&md5=344bae846454a057fab58aafffe3cd42,"Using a case study of Zimbabwe, this paper evaluates the performance of Zimbabwe's post independence exchange rate regimes. The analysis employs an exchange rate regime evaluation model that captures the link between deviations of the real exchange rate from its 'equilibrium' shadow price level, and real output volatility. The underlying hypothesis is that this 'link,' or relation, varies systematically with the exchange rate regime. Using the parallel market rate and an estimated equilibrium real exchange rate index as alternative shadow prices, the empirical exercise involves estimating the parameters of an aggregate demand and money demand model, and then to simulate the evaluation model to determine the optimal exchange rate regime. The findings show that a flexible rate regime systematically outperforms a fixed exchange rate in the Zimbabwean setting, resulting in more stable output under both measures, even after controlling for themost volatile period of the sample. The paper can infer that the Reserve Bank's inflexible approach to exchange rate management, even at a time when the currency was meant to be floating could have largely contributed to the failure of exchange rate policy. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Currency devaluation; Exchange rate regimes; Monetary policy; Output volatility,

Based on empirical study, it has been observed that poverty is multifaceted and its persistence is due to lack of productive resources. The Nigerian case reveals that the major constraint to improving the standard of living of the poor is capital (finance). This has restricted their extensive participation in economic activities which could improve their lives. For this study, our theoretical a priori expectation is that provision of microfinance services such as savings and microloans have direct impact on GDP. A causal relationship will be established and evaluated with the 't-test' statistic, while the relevance of the independent variables in explaining the subject will be justified based on the F-statistic test and R2 coefficient of multi-determination. Also, using a lin-log regression model, economic growth shall be regressed on poverty level in Nigeria. This will create an assertion whether Nigeria needs a systematic reinforcement of the microfinance mechanism to propagate a soothing trend for poverty reduction and economic growth. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Economic development; Economic growth; Financial services; Gross domestic product; Microfinance; Poverty,

We seek to provide evidence of a bi-directional causality between two reinforcing phenomena, privatization and globalization. Thus, we investigate whether privatization is a determinant of globalization, and whether globalization enhanced and contributed to the sustainability of the privatization process. Three broad groups of indicators are investigated: economic indicators, such as international trade; technological indicators, such as research and development, and lastly privatization indicators, such as the number of privatization transactions per year.

There has been a noticeable shift in paradigm in financial information regulation globally. Many governments are demanding increased financial information disclosures from financial institutions to investors and borrowers. To the extent that the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) has been attributed to a lax financial regulatory regime, there has been an increased propensity for control and disclosure. This stance has gained impetus despite evidence suggesting that increased financial information disclosures breed information oversupply. Information oversupply adversely effects individuals' rationalisation and financial decision-making processes, a matter which impedes on the overall market efficiency. Despite the proliferation of financial information oversupply in consumer financial markets, this phenomenon has remained relatively unexplored. This paper contributes to the literature by conducting an empirical exploration of the determinants of financial information oversupply emanating from the prevailing information regulatory regime. A model incorporating both the psychological and cost/benefit theoretical streams is proposed and tested using data collected from Melbourne residents in Australia. The Cost of Information Search and Prior Memory Structure were found to significantly influence the dependent variable, while the dependent variable did not significantly relate to Credit Experience and Age.

Analysis of critical factors affecting the quality cost of process management of Six Sigma project based on BSC,2011,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80051557363&partnerID=40&md5=55d7c2b701ae0381ff44b9542ebe522c,"Fierce competition resulted from past decade's globalization and liberalization has forced enterprises not only to focus on product quality, customer needs and satisfaction, but also to lower product cost as well. Businesses like medical, pharmaceutical, medical equipments and related industries must experience certain amount of pressure under the trend. Since July 2002, Taiwan has initiated new insurance payment system. And such a new system reduces the profit margin of pharmaceutical factories, causing them to face cost control issues. However, the niche of industries competition for profits lies on the proposition of value differentiation, which takes mainly advantages of maintaining high quality and low cost to establish irreplaceable dominance. The concept of Six Sigma project widely used in business can also be possible applied to promote the pharmaceutical production process by establishing standards of cost reduction. Nevertheless, the process management of Six Sigma project has still not yet popularized in the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, targeting at certain pharmaceutical factory, this research aims to investigate its current implementation of Six Sigma applied in the process management of projects as well as the relationship between Six Sigma process and the quality cost. According to the four dimensions of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC), the evaluation factors (criteria and sub-criteria) of Six Sigma project process are established. Using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with the opinions of domain experts, the relative weight of each factor of quality cost is then calculated. Finally, the result shows the relative importance of each factor of quality cost of Six Sigma project management in order would be ""Customer"" (0.594), ""Finances"" (0.183), ""Risks"" (0.096), ""Internal Process"" (0.066), and ""Learning and Growth"" (0.061). The proposed evaluation structure lays a foundation of process management pattern for Six Sigma project from the perspective of quality cost. The findings can provide an important reference to some other enterprises practicing quality cost control in their process management of Six Sigma project. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Analytic hierarchy process (AHP); Balanced scorecard (BSC); Process management; Quality cost; Six Sigma,
On the relationship between openness to trade and efficiency levels in low income countries: Evidence from the Latin American and the Caribbean countries,2011,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80053142677&partnerID=40&md5=1fd13ba882b0141d41055e66736c8b4f,"The existence of dichotomies in growth rates observed among some Latin American and Caribbean countries is often explained in some respects by the degree of openness to trade. Because efficiency is an important determinant of economic activity, we are interested in determining whether there is evidence of a significant relationship between openness to trade and efficiency levels in these two regions. The analysis is for the period 1992 to 2003 and includes 27 countries. Nonparametric analysis is used that allowed breaking down economic efficiency into two measures: technical and allocative efficiency. The estimated efficiency measures are regressed against the respective lagged efficiency indicator, the current openness-to-trade index and against one and two-period lagged openness indexes. In general, results do not support the hypothesis that openness to trade is correlated to efficiency for Latin America. However, in the case of the Caribbean, the twoperiod lagged openness-to-trade index has a positive and statistically significant impact on allocative and economic efficiency levels. Results are qualitatively the same when the relationship between openness to trade and efficiency is analyzed on a yearly basis. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Efficiency; Nonparametric analysis; Openness to trade,

Changes in credit specifications mainly affect the bank clients (private sector employees) who have 4000 TL monthly payment capability and over, three or more house owners, also clients who are already in use of mortgage credit. Another finding indicates that when monthly payment capability increases to the range of 2001-4000 TL saving level, investment decisions are less affective on mortgage credit selection. Private company workers are more sensitive on savings and investment decisions and their mortgage decisions are mainly affected by rent income potential rather than public company employees.

Upon this model, the problem of hedging currency risk in connection with the associated issue of optimal allocation of international portfolio can be solved successfully. We also contribute to the optimal option strategies for currency risk hedging. The model can automatically facilitate efficient currency risk management in terms of the type, volume and trading strategy of the hedging positions. Extensive empirical analyses show that although optimally selected forward contracts yield superior results in comparison to single protective puts per currency, the judicious selection of option trading strategies with suitable payoff patterns can obtain higher portfolio returns than that of forwards. In addition, we demonstrate that the adoption of integrated hedging across currencies consistently outperforms their separate counterparts and yields much higher benefits with very limited risk. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Currency risk; Forwards; Options; Risk management; Stochastic programming,

In this paper, we study the impact of the 2008 stock market crash on the co-movements of national stock markets and global portfolio diversification benefits. The data for the study are drawn from the Yahoo/Finance database and the study covers all the global stock markets included in the database. We compute rolling correlation coefficients to study time-varying correlation between the U.S. stock market and the world's other stock markets during the May 15, 2006-July 31, 2010 period. The findings indicate considerable volatility in the U.S. stock market correlation with all the other national stock markets, particularly with the Asian stock markets, during this period. U.S. correlation with all countries was very high during the October 10, 2007-March 9, 2009 crash period when all stock markets experienced a sharp fall. We use the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) technique to study the changes in the co-movement patterns of the markets. The number of statistically significant principal components is four for the May 15, 2006-October 10, 2007 pre-crash period, three for the October 10, 2007-March 9, 2009 crash period, and two for the March 9, 2009-July 31, 2010 post-crash period.

However, expectations of public may seriously temper monetary authorities' efforts even if the central bank intends to change the course in terms of policy. That is why; an inflation rate targeting framework may help convince public about the commitment of the central bank to its announcements for future inflation. We hypothesize that, for a successful anchoring exercise, inflation must be non-stationary prior to the adoption of an inflation targeting regime while it must be stationary thereafter. By using data from Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, and the UK with the help of a number of testing techniques, we show that while inflation is non-stationary before the inflation targeting was adopted as predicted, it turns out to be stationary thereafter. Yet, similar results are obtained for non- Inflation Targeting countries as well, such as the US, Japan and Germany. Therefore, it is difficult to exclusively credit inflation targeting in anchoring public's expectations. Our results suggest that perceptions on the credibility of central banks for achieving price stability is more important in forming public expectations on inflation. Therefore, central banks should primarily focus on the establishment of credibility to control inflation and achieve price stability. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Forecasting; Inflation targeting; International comparison,

The study uses four performance measures (including return on assets, return on equity, earning per share, and Tobin's Q) as dependent variable and three capital structure measures (including long-term debt, short-term debt and total debt ratios) as independent variable. The investigation is performed using panel data procedure for a sample of 320 listed companies in the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) over the period 2002- 2009. The results indicate that firm performance, which is measured by EPS and Tobin's Q, is significantly and positively associated with capital structure, while report a negative relation between capital structure and ROA. Moreover, there is no significant relationship between ROE and capital structure. Altogether, our study provides evidence that indicates firm performance is positively or even negatively related to capital structure. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Capital structure; Firm Performance; Panel Data; Tehran Stock Exchange,

S. private saving. The methodology assumes that households decide first on their consumption patterns and then save what is left from disposable income. In other terms saving is a residual. Therefore the determinants of saving are nothing else but the determinants of consumption, except for the inclusion of disposable income in the regression. The only other difference is that the signs of the coefficients on the explanatory variables are reversed. Hence, the saving function is modeled to depend on the income innovation, disposable income, the stock market, the jobless rate, and the inflation rate. Nominal and real interest rates do not enter significantly the regressions. Neither does market volatility, despite prior evidence. The hypothesis that saving is a residual fails strongly to be rejected. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Consumption; Disposable income; Income innovation; Inflation; Jobless rate; Market volatility; Real interest rates; Saving; Stock market,

Two popular long memory models, namely FIGARCH(1,d,1) and HYGARCH(1,d,1), are estimated to calculate the VaR values for Nikkei 225 future series. The well-known fat-tail phenomenons in financial time series are considered by estimating the models with normal, Student-t, and skewed Student-t innovations distributions. Empirical results indicate that volatility of Nikkei 225 futures is characterized by long memory. Next, because of the significant parameter estimation of the fat-tail term and the better results of VaR computations based on the Kupiec LR tests, this study also confirms that variations in Nikkei 225 futures are characterized by fat tails. Finally, after model comparisons using other density distributions in the in-sample and out-of-sample VaR calculations, the Kupiec LR tests demonstrate that the HYGARCH model is superior in forecasting than the FIGARCH and GARCH models, especially in the global financial crisis period. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Global financial crisis; HYGARCH; Kupiec LR tests; Long memory; Nikkei 225 futures; VaR,

Second, we examine both Dow- and Nasdaq-listed stocks indexes for a much longer period (1997-2007), including 2,475 trading days with 96,525 10-minute intraday observations compared with earlier studies and find statistically significant, complex intraday and interday effects of lagged returns on contemporaneous returns which, in turn, provide evidence of weekday effects. Third, consistent with an ""intraday timing of institutional order flow"" concept, both sets of indexes behave in a similar pattern, although there are some size-related differences as Dow stocks exhibit more mean-reversion over a weekly holding period. Overall, the intraday return differences are relatively small in economic terms and thus are not likely to present viable arbitrage opportunities. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",High frequency; Institutional trading; Intraday returns; Intraday volatility; Weekday effect,

It consists on determining the optimal capital structure of the companies. Recently, the capital structure has increasingly gained importance sine many companies have experienced financial distress and bankruptcy caused by the last financial crisis, it has drawn the interest of many researchers and it was a subject of considerable debate in both theoretical and empirical studies. This paper analyzes the explanatory power of some of the theories that have been proposed in the literature to explain changes the in the capital structures across companies. In particular, this study investigates capital structure determinants of companies traded on Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange based on a panel data set over 2008 and 2009 comprising 33 companies from different industries. In the literature, there are many potential factors that could affect the capital structure such as: the tangibility (asset structure), the non-debt tax shield, the profitability, the size, the expected growth, the uniqueness, the income variability, the industry classification dummies, the ownership structure and the age of the company. The purpose of this study is to examine the link between a number of potential capital structure determinants and the debt level of the companies included in our analysis. In the financial literature, there are several measures of the financial leverages (long-term, short-term, and convertible debt divided by market and book values of equity) but because of the non availability of the data, we will limit our study to the leverage measures in terms of the book values rather than the market ones. Our book leverage measures are decomposed into short-term and long-term debt ratios to highlight the magnitude of the components of the capital structure. At the first look of the capital structure of the companies, we can easily confirm that they are on average highly leveraged but it stays to determine the relationship between the potential determinants of the capital structure and the different leverage measures. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Agency Theory; Capital structure; Information Asymmetry; Pecking Order; Static Trade-Off,

China's inflation rate was always lower than Egypt's, while its growth rate totally surpassed it. This study attempts first, to compare the monetary policy transmission mechanisms in China and Egypt; second, to evaluate Egypt's readiness to replicate the Chinese paradigm by examining the main monetary policy instruments responsible for China's relatively low inflation and high growth. The paper uses Granger causality tests, a variance autoregressive (VAR) model, impulse response functions (IRF) and variance error decomposition (VDC) analyses to test for the main monetary policy instruments affecting growth and inflation in China and Egypt. Results prove that in the short run, replicating China's policy in Egypt would not be fruitful to Egypt. IRFs have shown that appreciation of the yuan immediately slows down growth, while appreciation of the Egyptian pound increases GDP for two years before it starts decreasing again. Increasing the interest rate decreases growth in China and Egypt as well; but the effect of interest rate on output is much weaker in China than in Egypt. However, the Chinese paradigm, focusing on low exchange and interest rates, may be may be fruitful in Egypt if the long run effect is targeted, since such policy would boost output without significantly affecting inflation. With respect to inflation, results indicate that the interest rate as a monetary policy transmission mechanism is weak in both countries. The exchange rate in China was still the most dominant factor affecting prices, while in Egypt both the exchange rate and interest rate contributions to price changes were modest. If the significance of interest rate as a monetary policy transmission mechanism in Egypt is weak in affecting inflation but crucial in influencing growth, then probably the growth target rather than the inflation target, should receive priority by Egyptian policy makers when shaping this policy instrument. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",China; Egypt; Growth; Inflation; Monetary policy; VAR model,

Our sample is from July 2001 to January 2003, the real estate that intermediaries sold was held by bank in Taiwan, including 363 the real estate and the price of bidding under bank auction. We obtain some interesting implication. First of all, we find that herding of bidding not only explains premium but also discount. However, the characteristics of real estate and information effects just explain part of them. For the strategy of reserve price by the vendor, the higher discount is to encourage bidding actively, which is consistent with the view of Welch (1992). Besides, we find optimism of bidder affects neither premium nor discount. The auction with high levels of bidder recognition caused by media concern offers significantly smaller premium. The strategy of jump bidding affects not only premium but also discount. All three factors could not weaken the explanatory power of herding of bidding. Secondly, we find bidders could easily reduce search cost by observing the bidding of competitors, and herding of bidding on the auction process could enhance efficiency of information aggregation. Furthermore, herding of bidding makes the performance of auction different between court and bank. Finally, we overcome the selective bias and find the real estate held by bank had poor performance under court auction; however, the real estate held by court had better performance under bank auction. This implies the mechanism of court auction should be transformed into the open-outcry bidding in order to achieve effective recovery of debt and the policy of reducing losses. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",English auction; Herding of bidding; Jump bidding; Overconfidence,

This study covered the quarterly data from the first quarter of 1982 to the second quarter of 2009. The youth unemployment in the Hong Kong is the level of unemployment among young people typically measured as those aged 15-19. From the second quarter of 2009, the unemployment rate of young people rose to 24.3%. Hong Kong is expected to undergo a continuous economic slowdown and a shrinking labour market under the financial crisis. Young people, especially those with low educational attainment, low levels of skill and those continuously unemployed, will find it even harder to secure a job. To find a way and offer them support so that they will not be marginalized in the labour market is one of our major concerns. This paper found that the Johansen test result reveals that the variables are cointegrated and the ordinary least squares estimator suggest that inflation and GDP are closely related to youth unemployment in Hong Kong. Also, the ordinary least squares test reveals that we may not conclude that the OWPH are related to the youth unemployment in Hong Kong. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",GDP; Hong Kong Immigrants; Inflation Rate; New Arrivals from Mainland China; One-way permit holders; OWPH; Youth Unemployment,

On the other hand, some thinkers assume that oil palm can become future direction of the world economy. Therefore the race of oil palm industry has become increasing competitive. However, price of oil palm keeps fluctuating over time. Due to the instability price of oil palm, there is risk and uncertainties that would be faced by tree-corps farmers if they depend too much on this agriculture product. Indeed, oil palms are more volatile compare to other commodities like cocoa, soybean and rubber at the international market. Tree-corps farmers, shareholder, traders, government and producer should consider the uncertainty and high risk in palm oil business world. Therefore, we develop CPO price prediction by using ARMA family and artificial neural network (ANN) using data stretching from 3rd January 2006 to 30th December 2010.

Training can be assessed by either financial measure of training expenses or non-financial measure of training hours. From the perspective of performance measurement in managerial accounting, this study contrasts the organization-level financial performance effects of training expenses and training hours. Based on the 1992-2005 Survey Report of Audit Firms in Taiwan, this study finds that the relation between training hours and financial performance is significantly positive but the relation between training expenses and financial performance is indeterminate. Further, degree of performancerelevance of training hours is higher than that of training expenses. Our findings justify the total training hours requirement by the public accounting profession and provide alternative explanation to the mixed results of relation between training and financial performance identified in prior studies. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Audit Firms; Performance-relevance; Training Expenses; Training Hours,
Do public education expenditures really lead to economic growth?

The issue has been extensively held regarding total government expenditures. This kind of intellect has a possibility to ignore the well-known positive impact of human capital on economic growth posited by endogenous growth theories. Through the analysis of public expenditures by government in detail, direct and indirect effects of human capital investments can also be apprehended. This article maps out a framework for thinking about the issue in the context of the causal relationship between public educational expenditures and economic growth in Turkey over the period 1973-2009. The empirical results based on Toda and Yamamoto (1995) causality analysis show that the relationship between government expenditures and growth is not in the form of bidirectional causation as causality runs only from economic growth to educational spending but not expenditures on education to economic growth. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Economic growth; Education; Government expenditures; Toda-yamamoto,

The precondition of these firms' success is the service they provide and adapting their customers to their processes in an optimal way. 3PL firms suffer from a dilemma about their service designs; tending to the standard services coming into prominence providing the same benefits to all their customers or focusing on the services more developed and totally adapted for a limited amount of customers. The pecuniary gainings to be obtained from alternatives will have more effects on decision-making processes.

The geometric functions and cointegration test as well as descriptive statistic framework were employed. It was found that the oil price was positively related to statutory allocation but the statutory allocation was not responsive to changes in oil price. This was because the federal government of Nigeria in 2003 de-linked from oil price by using benchmark to project government revenue. The study further revealed a non-long run relationship between the variables and indicated higher volatility of statutory allocation over oil price. The study concluded that since Nigerian economy generally relies on earnings from foreign exchange (particularly oil), It is imperative to maintain the benchmark policy in fiscal planning. This will reduce impact of external shocks that comes as a result of price fluctuation in the international market especially during global economic instability. And in turn will give the Nigerian government the resilience needed to tackle the major economic challenge of poverty. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Cointegration test; Fiscal federalism; Global Financial Crisis; Statutory allocation,

Perhaps rightly so, South Africa was considered a high-return, low-risk proposition, with hundreds of thousands of visitors expected for the event as a guarantee of return on investment in infrastructure, entertainment, and other projects. However, after the World Cup, South Africa retains its attraction for investors, not because there is still a guarantee of return but because the global economic turmoil has made the country the lesser of two evils. The instability in developed countries in Europe and the USA has sent risk-averse investors to look for projects with the potential of a stable and solid return; these investors have flocked to the shores of South Africa. Although there are significant benefits to the local people when the investment includes urban regeneration projects, which in this instance is defined as capital projects for the construction or upgrading of infrastructure, facilities or properties, it is not all sunshine and roses for the investors For this reason it is worthwhile to assess the intrinsic merits of the country rather than merely seeing it as a little more stable choice than the other options. The promise of return is likely to be more tenuous than it would seem, and potential investors should be well-advised to exercise caution when projecting their profits. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Development finance; Finance; Regeneration; South Africa; Urban regeneration,

Along with these developments, needs on financial knowledge and financial education have also ascended. Universities are the basic amenable in order to meet these needs. In this study, financial education at undergraduate level has been evaluated with the perspectives of experts and managers of regulatory and supervisory public organizations in Turkey. By reason of this study, it is stated that finance courses at undergraduate level do not meet the institutions' needs literally, are not sufficient compared to all courses for undergraduate programs and do not involve up to date applications. As a result, in finance education it is necessary to build cooperation between institutions and universities, to use case studies and tasks for research activities. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Efficiency at financial education; Financial education; Financial knowledge; Regulatory and supervisory institutions,
Venture capitalist's monitoring through board membership and the performance of IPO firms: Empirical evidence from France,2011,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79955753010&partnerID=40&md5=1d06819c6ae512380da9f339682d5780,"The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of the presence of a particular financial intermediary such as venture capitalist (VCs) on the resulting governance structures. This article investigates the composition of boards of directors in VC-backed firms and analyses whether board structure has an impact on performance. Using 106 French VC-backed firms, our methodology in this paper is to estimate four equations. A regression analysis is then used to study the impact of board structure on performance and also to analyze whether board variables (size, outside directors, COE chairman duality, proportion of VC directors, proportion of employee directors and board meeting frequency) are significant determinants of VC-backed firm performance. Results indicate a strong positive relation between board size and performance measured by ROA, Tobin's Q and MVA and negative relation between board size and performance measured by ROE. The proportion of independent outside directors on the board was positively associated with ROE. The presence of a dual leadership structure is negatively associated with ROE and positively associated with other measure of performance. No strong relation was found between the proportion of venture-capital in board, the presence of employee in board, or board meeting frequency and firm performance. Venture capitalists may have a more important role to play in corporate governance. By creating boards with low number of member and with greater independence, venture capitalists play a role in mitigating principal-agent problems and improve performance. The involvement of VCs in the entrepreneurial firm may be able to create value. This paper contributes to the limited literature by establishing the important role of venture capitalists in board structure. Other contribution is to use a French VC-backed firm in the sample. This is the first paper to study French context in regard of impact of board structure on performance. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Agency theory; Board structure (size and composition); Firm performance; Venture capital,

The GJR-GARCH model shows a decrease (increase) of the futures market volatility (spot market) during the crisis. Contrary to the spot index, we find no evidence of ""leverage effect"" in the futures market. The study of half-lives suggests that the speed of the mean reversion process differ across the chosen time scales, the market and the study period. Contrary to the spot market, the half-lives are lower during the period of crisis for futures markets series. Further investigating of the futures market, where there is no problem of non-synchronous trading, through the EARGARCH model shows that volatility movements and asymmetric effects differ depending on the sampling frequency. Regarding the transmission of volatility, the EC-GARCH model shows that it is bidirectional before the crisis with a predominance of the futures market. During the crisis, volatility spreads only from spot to futures. Earlier studies have shown lower co-movement between spot markets and futures markets in the high variance regimes. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",CAC 40 futures market; Crisis period; EAR-GARCH; EC-EGARCH; GJR-GARCH; Volatility transmission,

Lots of inner and outer factors affect consumer's purchase decision (Ünal and Ercis, 2006). Consumer, who is in the middle of a lot of stimulants like, complicated message content, news, visuals, e-mails etc, is trying to develop a specific purchasing method or purchasing behaviour to handle the situation. In modern societies, shopping and consuming are not only for responding human needs, they also shape people's lifestyle and even more started to play a part of changing their characters. At this point, we can talk about consumer identity. A person's all characteristic features pass to his' consumer identity and in the same way, consumer identity pass to characteristic features. That shows us, although being highly complex and inscrutable; there are a lot of things about consumers to figure out. If we say that the main purpose of analyzing consumer behaviour is to find out, how, where and why consumers bought, used and threw away the products, services, thoughts and something else to consume, then observing, understanding and making comment about consumer behaviour are crucial matters. It is thought that, consumers are shopping in a different way while impulse shopping in comparison to traditional shopping. Time to time impulse shopping is defined as out of control behaviour or foible, but they constitute an important part of consumption. They are generally hedonic shopping. Therefore, in this study, impulse shopping concept is studied as one of consumer shopping behaviour, the reasons of why consumers' bend to this and the characteristic structure of consumers' who prefer impulse purchasing. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Consumer Shopping Styles; Impulse Consumption; Impulse Purchasing Behaviour; Impulse Shopping,

However, in a globalised world economy, the crisis has serious implications for developing countries, which are highly dependent on trade, foreign investment, and remittances to meet economic growth and social needs. Though without doubt, there are particular countries that were adversely affected, but there were also countries where the effects of the crisis have been minimal or successfully mitigated. This paper analyses the case of a small island economy of Mauritius which has not been spared by the crisis. However, the impact has been in general moderate with an appropriate policy mix adopted by the government and the private sector. Our study firstly examines the various transmission channels via which the crisis has operated on the Mauritian economy by analysing macroeconomic indicators from 2007 to 2010. Second, we undertake a survey of 150 firms within the private sector to discuss their performance and also the mitigating actions taken to counter the effects of the crisis.

Accordingly, state fragility index was used first in its aggregate form and the result shows no evidence for state fragility in affecting FDI inflow in Africa. Since this outcome was contrary to what the theory and intuitions suggest, state fragility has become decomposed into fragility in government legitimacy and fragility in government effectiveness. Consequently, the findings reveal that fragility in government effectiveness has strongly and adversely influenced FDI inflow, while there was lack of evidence to prove that fragility in government legitimacy has influenced FDI inflow in Africa.

Our study illustrates how certain key credit risk ratios can be used to measure the credit risk in the banking sector. The results indicate that there is a consistent increase in the total loans to total assets ratio and total loans to total deposits ratio for both public and private sector during the period of study.

Also, we examine the asymmetric timeliness of reported (or managed) earnings and unmanaged earnings (earnings before exertion of real activities manipulation) in the firms engaging in real earnings management (suspect firms) and the other firms. We detect abnormally low CFO, abnormally low discretionary expenses and abnormally high production costs for companies that report small positive net incomes at the annual level. The evidence is consistent with firms trying to increase reported annual earnings beyond zero by giving price discounts to boost sales temporarily and by overproduction and decrease in discretionary expenses. Finally, we find that the asymmetric timeliness of reported earnings in suspect firms is significantly lower than of other firms but there is no significant difference between the asymmetric timeliness of unmanaged earnings in suspect firms and others. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Asymmetric timeliness of earnings; Real activities; Real earnings management; Tehran stock exchange; Zero threshold,

The study found that there is much variation and misallocation in student teacher ratio, class size and per student expenditure among schools. The study found that misallocation of student teacher ratio, class size and per student expenditure leads to the wastage of resources and lower level of academic achievement. Reduction in student teacher ratio and class size, and addition in per student expenditure are very expensive; therefore, policy can be decided considering the funds constraints.

There have also been charges that certain GLC investments have been politically rather than commercially motivated. Hence, the current study aims to contribute to the literature on the effect of government ownership to the performance of GLCs in Malaysia. Indeed GLCs are key drivers of the Malaysian economy and besides that GLCs also have its own unique characteristics of its government ownerships and not many other countries having such structure among their listed companies. Specifically, this study investigates the governance structure of governmentlinked companies (GLCs) in Malaysia under the ownership/control structure of Khazanah Holdings, the government holding entity, which typically owns substantial cash flow rights to manage Malaysian GLCs. Based on a sample of 47 GLCs and 47 non-GLCs companies listed on Bursa Malaysia over a 6-year period of 2001-2006, the current study found that there is a significant difference in various corporate performance measures (financial and market) between these two groups of companies. Most GLCs corporate performance is lower than non GLCs. A possible reason is that the GLCs Transformation Manual has just been introduced in 2005 and it will probably take a few years for the operational enhancement initiatives outlined in the Manual to take effect. However, the results based on multiple regression show that government involvement in GLCs has a positive significant relationship on firm performance among Malaysian GLCs. The investors believe that GLCs are backed by the government which will not let them down in time of trouble. In fact the investor's confidence on the government's effort will contribute towards equality and stability of the economy. The result of the study contradicts the argument that the economic problems in most East Asian countries has been caused by government intervention. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Corporate governance; Government ownership; Government-link companies,

The paper hypothesizes that the explanatory power of earnings for stock returns (measured by the returns-earnings adjusted R2) is significantly improved by incorporating any one of the three innovations individually and jointly in the specification of return earnings relation. The empirical findings support this hypothesis. Moreover, the goodness-of-fit is the highest for the model that combines all the three innovations together. These results are robust to the regression models estimated using fixed effects for both time and firms.

Optimal inflation targets and the role of the central bank in Albania,2011,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79952209408&partnerID=40&md5=a56a3a019fce16d9cf26c34488d43b32,"Inflation targeting is a monetary policy strategy that encompasses five main elements; the public announcement of medium-term numerical targets for inflation rate (most countries have chosen an inflation target of 2-3%), an institutional commitment to price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy, to which other goals are sub-ordered, an information inclusive strategy in which many variables are used, increased transparency of the monetary-policy strategy through communication with the public and the markets about the plans, objectives, and decisions of the monetary authorities, increased accountability of the central bank for attaining its inflation objectives. Kenneth Rogoff (1985) suggested delegation of monetary policy to an independent conservative central bank. ""Conservative"" means weight-conservative, having less (but still positive) weight on employment stabilization than society. In the present study we examine the performance of inflation-targeting regimes in Albania, with or without persistence in employment. An inflation-targeting regime is interpreted as a principal agent arrangement, where the principle (society) delegates monetary policy to the agent (central bank). Society can commit to targets for the central bank in the form of a loss function over macroeconomic outcomes. More precisely, the delegation of monetary policy has three components; society assigns a loss function to the central bank, the central bank is given independence to minimize the assigned loss function without interference from the government, the central bank is held accountable for minimizing the assigned loss function. The mathematical model has three agents: the private sector, the government, and the central bank. The private sector behavior is characterized by a Phillips curve with rational expectations and employment persistence. Assume that the private sector has rational agents. The government is assumed to have the same preferences as society. We assume that the central bank has perfect control over inflation rate,πt after having observed and evaluated the current random supply shock εt. Since the random employment shocks has future effects (as well as current effects) on employment rate, εt it becomes more important to stabilize employment. Therefore, inflation rate is allowed to fluctuate. This conclusion is useful for the Albanian government. The discretion results in a forth best equilibrium with too high inflation. Under employment persistence, the inflation rate is also too variable. K. Roggof (1985) has shown that the discretionary equilibrium can be improved if the monetary policy is delegated to a weight-conservative central bank. That means, the government delegates monetary policy to a central bank with both goal and instrument independence. L.E.O Svensson (1997) shows that state-contingent inflation targeting induces an independent and conservative central bank (in the sense of K. Roggof, 1985) to follow the optimal monetary policy rule when employment is persistent. In his forceful critique, B.T. McCallum (1995) argues that the state-contingent nature on monetary policy may undermine its credibility, because the delegation merely relocates the problem of monetary policy from central bank to its political principal (the government). Such a process runs the risk of political pressure or interference (see G. Jonsson, 1997). We will show that it nevertheless is possible to attain the optimal rule in monetary policy is Svensson's model (1997) through state-independent delegation. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",,

Recent literatures have had conflicting arguments on the impact of a host country government on FDI inflows. The different forms of democracies in the world today create an ultra ambiguous interpretation of the term ""Democracy"". It becomes increasingly more difficult to agree on a universally acceptable definition, as more forms of democracy emerge around the world. In this paper, we investigate the influence of democracy on FDI inflow in Sub-Saharan Africa. The results suggest that as Sub-Saharan countries progress towards a stronger and more efficient democracy FDI inflow declines. We also tested for the impact of education on FDI inflow; our results suggest that as the quality of basic education improves in Sub-Saharan African countries, FDI inflow reduces. This finding might be explained by the positive association of education with both economic and human development. As the society becomes more educated and developed, its policies and overall orientation is channeled towards its domestic productivity and economic growth, and as a result becomes more resourceful. The harmonized interest of the host country now supersedes the profit maximization interest of the MNCs.

This study compares five different minimum wage measurements commonly used in the literature (a) the log of real minimum wage; (b) toughness; (c) the fraction below the minimum wage; (d) the fraction at the minimum wage; (e) the fraction affected minimum wage. This study also employs several different panel data methods, including the simple fixed effects model, instrumental variable method, and a Dynamic Arellano-Bond panel data model in order to obtain the most robust estimates of the effects of minimum wage on employment in Indonesia. Although the findings vary across different minimum wage measures and methods, the result suggests that an increase in minimum wage reduces paid employment in the covered sector, as predicted by the standard competitive model. The result generally shows that there is no significant impact on total paid employment because of the non-compliance problem in Indonesia. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Employment; Indonesia; Minimum wage; Panel data,
"The forecast domestic investment, employment, GDP in US by optimal ordering of variables and bootstrap replications in SVECM",2011,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79952932504&partnerID=40&md5=35cafa905b0cc983a40ba7f7714fa345,"Foreign Direct Investment has been playing a prominent role in capital market of recent decades. In this paper, the capital stocks are divided into two types, namely domestic investment capital stock and foreign direct investment capital stock. Linear deterministic trend is proven to be a necessary term in the model. The dynamic relationship among capital stocks, GDP, employment and Oil Price are quantified by using SVECM impulse response and variance decomposition analysis. It is empirically proven that Oil Price can significantly and adversely affect capital stocks, GDP and employment. Domestic Investment is also forecast to strongly bounce back from the bottom in 2009. Because of limited number of observation, instead of nonlinear model, SVECM is employed. Furthermore, this paper does not suggest imposing restrictions without sound economic theory behind [note 1]. In order to identify restrictions, a new approach is invented to determine optimal endogenous variable ordering and optimal number of bootstrap replications in SVECM [appendix 4]. Similar approach has never been discussed in previous research literatures. Just over-identified restrictions will also be used to prove the validity of the proposed set of restrictions via LR statistics. Can Control of Oil Price and Promotion of FDI guarantee recovery of US economy? The empirical study of this paper may shed much more light on this. Result shows that the employment, GDP and Domestic Investment Capital Stock have already reached their bottom values and are now bouncing back in 2010. However, Oil Price shock will increase price level and decrease money supply leading to worse-off unemployment. The result is consistent with IS-LM model [note 2]. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Employment and domestic investment capital stock forecast SVECM optimal ordering of variables Just over-identified restrictions LR statistics; FDI capital stock oil price [note 3] SVECM impulse response variance decomposition output,
Is there a trade-off between current-account deficits and economic growth?

Even though, the importance of environmental issue as one of the important aspects in sustainable development is fully understood, the economic growth remains as the main target. In Indonesia, industry is one of the important sectors both in term of its contribution to national output and national energy consumption. Based on Indonesian Statistic Bureau, industry is always at the top list of contributors of national energy consumption since 2000. This paper will employ decomposition analysis to calculate factors contribution towards energy intensity changes. Moreover, we will also conduct panel data method to analyze the determinants of energy intensity in the firm level data. The result suggests that during the period given, even though the level of energy intensity in the industry relatively worse than the national level but the condition of energy intensity in Indonesian industry varies across sub sectors. Moreover, the econometric analysis suggests that wage, age, capital intensity and share of capital owned by private have positive impacts on energy intensity; whereas sizes of firms, labor productivity and technology intensity have negative impacts on energy intensity. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.",Decomposition; Energy intensity; Firm; Industry; Panel data,

It is an issue of resource management. Resource management is an efficient and effective deployment for an organization's resources when they are needed. It is the target of every business firm or a company to maximize its benefits within the scarce resource inputs. Same is the case of schools. However, if school resource inputs are used ineffectively and wasted, the lower level of achievement is achieved. The sample of the study includes 288 secondary schools, 2880 secondary teachers and 5760 secondary students. The data were collected through a school profile proforma, a questionnaire for secondary teachers and a 'result sheet' consisting of middle level and secondary stage results of the same students. Pearson correlation was used to analyze the data. The value-added approach was used for the study. The study finds that the school resource inputs are deficiently available and inefficiently used. It was also found that school resource inputs are misallocated. Misallocation is also a big source of inefficient use of school resource inputs. Therefore, misallocation and big gap between the deficient level and full level of usage lead to the wastage of resources. The policy implication of the study is that if resource inputs are properly allocated and used at the optimal level, the student achievement may be enhanced effectively.

The findings suggest that, the higher equity incentive and the lower the value of executive stock option in executives' compensation plan, the more restucturing decisions the executive will make, even when these choices could accelerate the firm's failure. Nevertheless, there is only weak evidence that replacing the executive will increase the likelihood of restructuring decisions over liquidation decisions when the firm is facing financial distress. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Executive stock options; Financially distressed firm; Liquidation; Restructuring,

Do Board Independence and audit committees motivate disclosure on Different Corporate Governance information categories in the annual reports in developing countries?,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78649793706&partnerID=40&md5=0f6451873cbc4f67337e204fc4cc8d94,"In this study we examine the impact of board independence and the presence of an audit committee on the level of disclosure of different corporate governance (CG) information categories (i.e. Ownership structure and exercise of control rights, Financial transparency and information, Auditing, Corporate responsibility and compliance, and Board and management structure and process) of the 30 most actively traded companies on the Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX). The findings indicate that the different categories of CG disclosure are associated with board independence which is consistent with a complementary relationship between independent directors and disclosure. However, the results throw into question the cost benefit relationship of establishing audit committees in the active share trading Egyptian firms, since there is no significant association between the existence of these committees and the different CG disclosure categories. Therefore, awareness building, education and training, incentives or disincentives to disclose including the nature of enforcement regimes are possible policy recommendations, but all carry costs as well as benefits.

The purpose of this study is to actualize the prediction of bank bankruptcies whose financial structures have gone bad for various reasons and the banks have been transferred to the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF). This paper aims to provide an alternative for bank bankruptcy prediction with Neuro Fuzzy. Neuro Fuzzy does not have the problems, which come from the assumptions of statistical methods, and, as in Artificial Neural Networks, it has learning ability. At the same time, the model does not stay in a black box like Artificial Neural Networks. In the process of predicting, the model can be interpreted. Because of these features, Neuro Fuzzy appears as an alternative in bankruptcy prediction. In this study, the addition of the forerunner indicators on the decision making process can also be interpreted besides getting a high prediction of accuracy from Neuro Fuzzy. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Artificial neural network; Bank bankruptcy prediction; Early warning systems; Multivariate discriminant analysis; Neuro fuzzy,

This paper analyses the newly reformed pension system in Romania, presents and explains the current structure of the system and reviews its regulatory framework. Further, we show that the Romanian private pensions market is highly concentrated and that the asset allocation, while heterogenic at pillar-level, reveals an overall conservative approach. Both the average fund unit value (VUAN) and total assets of Romanian private funds have increased steadily since inception and the weight of pension assets in Romania's GDP doubled in the last year, although it remains modest both in absolute terms and in comparison with other post-communist transition economies in the CEE region. Finally, we find that risk-adjusted portfolio performance is significantly better for mandatory than for voluntary Romanian private pension funds and the best performing funds are the funds most heavily invested in stocks and mutual funds units, respectively. We conclude that the positive performance is explained and determined both by the overall positive performance of the blue chip exchange-listed Romanian common stocks during the research period and by manager's superior selection ability. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",CEE transition economies; Pension legislation; Pension system reform; Private pension market; Riskadjusted portfolio performance; Romania,

We point out that holding higher return investments even in the long run can be disadvantageous since, if the mean of a risky investment does not exceed the variance increment considerably, the investor cannot rely on positive growth of capital. We present the optimal trade-off between the single period mean and variance which provides maximum growth if the return distribution is not highly skewed and higher moments are negligible.

Most works in the literature agree that shocks in the oil price bear a significant portion of the responsibility of exchange rate fluctuations. However, the question of whether exchange rate dynamics have an impact on oil price movements has received no conclusive answer. This paper employs a two-step regression approach to show that exchange rates can affect the crude oil price disturbance, and therefore equilibrium oil prices. By use of an auxiliary regression, the dynamics of oil price disturbance are separated from the observed prices and tested against the effective exchange rate of the U.S. dollar. In an empirical dataset covering twenty years, we detect a significant two-way causal relationship between such dynamics and the exchange rate. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Crude oil; Exchange rate; Price disturbance; Vector error correction model,

Observations of the whole sample and sub-samples show a significantly positive sell-off impact on shareholder wealth. In addition, the long-run abnormal return of the debt reduction sellers is higher than that of investment sellers. Moreover, there is a significantly positive relation between long-run abnormal returns and the magnitude of cash proceeds for the whole sample. The aforementioned positive relation strengthens for investment sellers of higher growth opportunity.

This allows us to estimate simultaneously the main shock factors influencing the implied volatility for three different maturities. Empirical results show common factors with the level, slope, and curvature interpretation known from the financial literature. From a time series analysis, we conclude that an AR(1)/Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a suitable model for factor dynamics.

The study uses BSI to measure the sentiment of individual investors and institutional investors. The timing that investor sentiment affects the stock returns of IPOs is classified to current period sentiment and prior period sentiment. Quantile regression is used to explore how sentiment proxies can affect initial returns of IPOs at different points of the initial returns distribution. The results show that only the individual investors' sentiment in current period has a significantly positive relationship with the initial returns of IPOs, especially under the low and medium discount range. Therefore, the individual investor sentiment in current period, in comparison to the sentiment of institutional investors, affects the initial returns of IPOs more. The sentiment of individual investors (institutional investors) before an IPO is positively (negatively) related to the initial returns of IPOs and a more shorter time lag sentiment of individual investors and institutional investors has more explanatory power than a more longer one. In addition, companies with lower (higher) individual (institutional) investor sentiment in the current period and before an IPO with 10 days lag, the long-run performance is better. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Bsi; Initial returns; Investor sentiment; Ipo,

The results suggest that rural poor households are more vulnerable to economic shocks, especially inflation. In more detailed analysis, price fluctuation on foods and its products has larger impact on poverty relative to non-food commodity.

We find evidence in favor of central bank control over credit market via short-term interest rates, which is more apparent in the post-credit boom period. Estimation results reveal that while corporate loans are not sensitive to changes in the policy rate, cash and automobile loan rates are responsive to the policy rate.

First, using piecewise linear version of McNichols' (2002) model, total accruals are divided to discretionary and nondiscretionary accruals. Second, applying the Mishkin (1983) test, this paper examines whether the market rationally prices earnings components with respect to their one-year-ahead earnings implication. The results indicate that the abnormal accruals are less persistent than normal accruals which in turn, are less persistent than cash from operations (OCF). Moreover, the results of the Mishkin (1983) test show that the market overestimates the persistence of, and thus overprices, both normal and abnormal accruals, but the overpricing of normal accruals is more severe. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Discretionary accruals; Earnings; Mispricing; Operating cash flow,

This ability is assessed by minimizing the financial returns' conditional volatility estimated by the ARCH and GARCH specifications. Using a data from 94 listed and industrial firms in four East Asian countries: Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines between 1996 to 1998, the results show that the board size and the presence of independent directors are negatively linked to the conditional volatility of the financial returns. These results are compatible with the argument which suggests that the efficient boards enhance the managers' ability to control and that of the firms to withstand the crisis. The leadership structure would be without any effect on the resistance to the crisis and the Chief Executive Officer' turnover would have a positive impact on the volatility of the financial returns.

This definition of the set of states allows both the magnitude and the direction of change to be incorporated into the analysis. The findings show that the Markov Chains model did not give a precise prediction of the direction in which prices were headed in the short run. In addition, it is shown that under a fairly general partial adjustment Markov Chain model of stock price determination, price movements which do not display the random walk characteristics may be interpreted as purely following a Markov process; while a set of hypotheses and standard methods is suggested for drawing statistical inferences in time on the randomness of stock prices when Markov Chains are applied. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Markov chains; Markov processes; Random walk; Stock price transition,
Determinants of gender based wage discrimination in Pakistan: A confirmatory factor analysis approach,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78449262471&partnerID=40&md5=1ede319415819a096e5e167bc659f938,"This paper is an empirical study of the development of labour market participation and wage differentials between males and females in Pakistan between 1999 and 2008. There is little known about the position of women in the labour market of Pakistan. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the gender based wages differences in Pakistan by knowing the individual and socio-cultural factors. This has been done by the application of regression models and earning estimations on the panel data taken from Pakistan Labour Force Survey for analyzing factors responsible for gender based wages discrimination. This study employs Oaxaca & Blinder decompositions to measure the effects of wages discrimination. Mincer earning function is used to estimate the earning equations for males and females and confirmatory analysis approach exhibits that the adverse treatment of female labour market participation is the largest identifiable reason why the wage gap is in the same type of paid employment and it further emanates differences in remunerations. The empirical findings indicate that individual factors particularly education and labour market experience are the most important determinants as evident from the decreasing gap of wage differentials for higher level of education, while organizational factors are assumed constant for this research. This is concluded that gap is increasing with the passage of time and causes and extent of gender based wages discrimination in Pakistan's labour market is multi-folded. The Government should understand its implications as a major impediment to resolve unemployment in Pakistan and also discriminatory practices in Pakistan. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",,

II) The other objective is to identify the type of households in the population more prone to default on payments. III) How demographic and situational factors (such as employment status, family type, income level, locations) coupled with behavioral aspect affect default risk. The proposed study employs collection of relevant secondary data about housing loan account in Default from the select Bank branches/processing centres of the Bank within Patna. Secondly primary data has been collected from the relevant borrowers by contacting them, administering them a set of questionnaire to check on the efficacy of the variables and to register the dynamic changes within the variable.

The data are classified on an annual basis according to the country's policy decision in that year: weak reformers, moderate reformers and strong reformers. This approach allows both control-group and before and after analyses. The evidence suggests three hypotheses. First, countries with weak reforms have performed betterly in comparison with those that have moved to greater market orientation. Countries ranked with a policy score of 1 perform well on all indicators, other than investment growth and export growth, than those with scores of 3. Second, economic performance does not differ greatly between moderate and strong ones. But in case of inflation there is a significant difference between group 2 and group 3. The third hypothesis follows from noting that there is little difference in agricultural growth, manufacturing growth and overall growth among 3 groups. It is surprising that manufacturing growth is greater in case of weak reforms.

Our results, using 2095 firm-year observations over the 1996-2004 period, show that at high levels of investment opportunities, there is only information content in the short-term component of discretionary accruals. Moreover, there is evidence that the value-relevance of short-term discretionary accruals increases in the presence of investment opportunities.

The deplorably low levels of public investment have rendered India's physical infrastructure incompatible with large increases in the national product. Clearly, without improving the rate of infrastructure investment, the overall growth rate at best would remain modest. Empirical research validates that the economic advancement of a nation critically hinges on the adequacy of infrastructure availability. In the light of huge financing gaps for financing infrastructure projects and constraints on all sources of funds including bank funding, there is rise in using project finance as a tool for financing capital expenditures particularly the investments in infrastructure projects in India.

We consider the weight (debt ratio) as an exogenous variable, based on which the threshold and the real option value are obtained by the optimization of an investment opportunity with respect to optimal timing. Sensitivity analyses are then performed to investigate the effects of parameters such as price uncertainty, cost and tax rates, funding rates, market share, and demand elasticity under different funding policy. The results show that the price drift and volatility might demonstrate reversed effects, depending on whether demand elasticity is greater or less than one. However, the market share and the cost rate have no effect on the investment threshold, but have some impacts on real option value. In general, higher debt ratio contributes more to the investment threshold and to the real option value, confirming that financial leverage might serve as a value driver. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Financing policy; Investment; Price uncertainty,

However, we find cases where empirical research based on time-series data do not explicitly account for time-series properties of the Ohlson model. They are likely to have spurious regressions in the analytic process and affect the reliability of empirical results. The main purpose of this study is to apply unit root and cointegration test to examine time-series properties of the Ohlson model, and we further use the fractional cointegration method to test the Ohlson model and explore whether model exists the relation of long-term equilibrium. This study is based on a sample of 122 firms, which complete data are available from second quarter of 1990 to the third quarter of 2005. Empirical results show that: (1) market value and book value are nonstationary for most of the sample firms. More importantly, book value and residual income cointegrate with market value for 64.29 percent of the sample firms at the 0.05 level. (2) when we use a semiparametric frequency domain procedure of Robinson (1995), we find that the ratio of cointegration will widely elevate.

The object of this paper is to test the effect of direct-indirect tax composition on economic growth for the Turkish Economy for the period of 1968-2006 and to assess whether the choice between direct and indirect taxes is linked to the growth rate of the economy or not. The model in this analysis employs Feder model to investigate the relation between tax composition and growth in Turkey. In line with the predictions of the endogenous growth models, our findings suggest that the real output is positively related to indirect tax revenue but direct taxation has no significant effect.

Those firms that are trading futures on Karachi stock exchange were analyzed from July, 2001 to January, 2010. Three time series i.e. Futures Index, Spot Index and KSE-100 Index were used in the process. To make futures and spot indices comparable with KSE-100 index, indices were calculated by using market value weighted index method. GARCH model is used to assess volatility in Spot, KSE-100 and futures returns. GARCH analysis confirmed volatility clustering. It was appraised that the existed soaring volatility in the previous period will continue to be high in the current period. Volatility shocks were also found to be quite persistent. The results of Granger Causality direct us to the fact that KSE-100 market assist in the forecast of both spot and futures markets but on the contrary spot and futures were not found to forecast each other and KSE-100 market. Empirical evidence showed that KSE-100, spot and futures markets are highly volatile and every market contributes to increase the volatility of other market. The paper evaluated that introduction of futures market has increased the volatility of underlying spot market.

This paper analyzes mortgage fee differentials among banks, mortgage corporations, building societies and credit unions operating in Australia during the research period. Findings suggest that banks charged the highest total, origination and ongoing fees while mortgage corporations have the lowest ongoing fees. The results also suggest that mortgage corporations require the same level of total fees as those of member-based institutions (building societies and credit unions), however banks and building societies have about 7 and 3 basis points of ongoing fees respectively more than mortgage corporations. Ongoing fees are an important mortgage cost because a borrower must pay them for a whole life of a loan, unlike the upfront fees that are paid just once. It also suggests that unlike mortgage corporations (the securitizer), depository lenders that charged higher ongoing fees probably maintain the customer relationship. This provides preliminary evidence in line with the existing US literature that there are statistically significant differences between the fee structures of Australian mortgage products. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Australian mortgage lenders; Fee differentials; Mortgage fees,

This paper discusses six different options for the construction of an ILOLR that supports central banks during currency crises. The paper concludes that the most cost efficient version of the ILOLR would be direct intervention by the IMF using IMF resources, with the option of using additional reserves from central banks. The paper considers measures of cost efficiency, such as cost of borrowing, intervention, and sterilization and moral hazard problems. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Currency crises; International lender of last resort; International monetary fund,

Thus, we evaluate the productive performance of Islamic banks with the technique of productive efficiency proposed by Farrell (1957). We use the method of data envelopment analysis (DEA) to decompose the productive efficiency into technical efficiency, allocative efficiency and cost efficiency. The application of this technique on a sample of 23 Islamic banks reveals that the technical inefficiency and allocative inefficiency increased bank costs, on average, by about 14% and 29% respectively. In addition, the results show that internal and external factors seem to contribute significantly to the evolution of efficiency scores of Islamic banks operating in the GCC region. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Islamic banking,

Previous research also shows hedge trades generate particular stock return patterns. In this paper, we investigate the relation between order imbalance and the intraday return of hedging stocks when hedging events happen. We employ a time varying GARCH model to capture the time series properties in the event day. We find that contemporaneous order imbalances have a significant effect on stock returns. However, the relationship between order imbalances and stock returns becomes insignificant in the second day. It implies that the significant positive contemporaneous intraday return and order imbalance relation decays soon. It contributes a lot to hedge strategy in term of hedge time horizon. In addition, we test size effects in the intraday return and order imbalance relation. The results show that there is a significantly positive relationship between market capitalization and the impact of order imbalance on its stock return.

But the role of foreign institutional investment in the economic development of India is a recent topic of discussion among economists and development planners. Since the implementation of the new economic policies in early 1990s, India emerged as an important destination of global investors' investment. It is from September 14, 1992, FIIs have been investing on financial instruments in India and providing incentives for financial innovations in the country. Recently, they have become the movers and shakers of the market. Given this growing importance of FIIs for the Indian economy, it is essential that the dynamics of such cross-border portfolio investment in the context of economic growth of the country be examined. It is with this aim an attempt has been made in this paper to test the causality between foreign institutional investments and the real economic growth in India over a period 1993:Q1 to 2009:Q2. The Granger Causality test in the VAR framework provides the evidence of bi-directional causality running between these two variables. Therefore, by the formulation and implementation of prudential norms concerning cross-border investments, the planners and policy makers in India can help the country moving in a high growth trajectory.© EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Economic growth of india; FIIs; Foreign portfolio investment; Granger causality test; Vector auto regressive model,

Additionally, owing to the significant parameter estimation of the fat-tail term and the better results obtained via VaR computations based on the Kupiec LR tests, this investigation also confirms that variations in Asian stock index futures exhibit fat tails. Third, empirical results indicate that the HYGARCH model displays superior explanation ability to the other models during insample periods. Fourth, on average, the skewed Student-t GJR-GARCH model outperforms other models during the global financial crisis period. The long memory models thus are not the best models for fitting extreme stock volatility, such as occurred during the global financial crisis period.

The study not only was able to show that some companies time the market, while others do not, but also was able to explain the ""Post- Listing Anomaly."" The sample evidence shows that host market condition plays an important role in answering the combined questions of why companies cross list and why there is a ""Post-Listing Anomaly."" On one hand, the evidence reveals, companies who cross list in a host market while that host market is ""Up"" and achieve significant negative post abnormal returns, those companies time the market and the post market anomaly is explained in the context of market timing. On the other hand, if companies cross list in a host market while that host market is ""Down"" and achieve positive post abnormal returns whether it is significant or not, means those companies did not engage in market timing, or else, why would they time a market that is down, moreover that proves that the ""Post- Listing Anomaly"" does not exist and that is by itself an explanation that it is not an anomaly.

However, we find that assets play a much more decisive role in determining corporate profits, should the given brokerage firm have a bank-origin.

Secondly, money has the strongest relative importance among the variables in explaining the behaviour of the CPI at longer horizons.

Skewness had an important effect on returns but Kurtosis didn't have significant relation with returns during the three years of research period. Unsystematic risk was not zero that indicates investors do not hold diversified portfolios. Our results indicate that the relationship between returns and beta is nonlinear. We examined a conditional relationship between risk and returns during up and down markets and didn't observe any difference between these two periods, except for the explanatory power of beta during down market period.© EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Down market; Kurtosis; Nonlinear relation; Skewness; Systematic risk; Up market,

The result shows that expropriation is the main incentive that induces the controlling owners to select affiliated board directors. We find that the controlling owners select more affiliated board directors to entrench their interests after poor performance. Besides, the entrenchment behavior appears to be reinforced when the divergence between control rights and cash flow ownership increases. But the behavior appears to be mitigated when the controlling owner's ownership is higher.

For this purpose, on the basis of the agency theory concept, required data were collected from all qualified firms accepted in Tehran Securities Exchange (TSE) for 2003 to 2007. Then, four basic hypotheses for investigating the statistical relation between board of directors' bonus amounts and economic value added; board of directors' bonus amounts and market value added; relative changes in bonus and economic value added growth; and relative changes in bonus and market value added growth, were specified. Consequently, by utilizing adjusted R square, analysis of variance and a linear regression model, the relationship between boards of directors' bonuses of the selected firms with economic performance evaluation measures were investigated. Each of these hypotheses was examined at the level of selected industries as secondary hypotheses. The results of the research at the level of all corporations demonstrate that, only the relationship between the market value added and board of directors bonus amount is significant. Similarly, examining hypotheses at the level of investigated industries, suggest that there is a stronger correlation between board of directors' bonus amounts and the market value added in each industries. Furthermore, by substituting relative changes in the board of directors' bonus for the bonus amounts, the results of the hypotheses were weakened, in such a way that would specify there is not any significant relationship between relative changes in board of directors' bonuses with economic value added and market value added growth. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Agency theory; Board of directors' bonus; Economic performance evaluation models; Economic Value Added (EVA); Market Value Added (MVA); Tehran Securities Exchange (TSE),

While changing government expenditures, consumption and average exchange rates, investment, foreign direct investment have direct impact on GDP. Inflation also affects GDP negatively as expected. Since oil is the major import of Pakistan and every year we spend a lot of foreign exchange to purchase this basic necessity so that for government there are number of policy recommendations. First that the government must either try to find out cheap and better substitutes for oil like CNG, LPG or Ethanol but must also try to involve foreign multi-national companies(MNCs) to do oil exploration specially in Attock region, Balochistan and Sindh to exploit available resources to overcome deficiency. Secondly if government gives subsidy to encourage common man to raise his purchasing power, this puts additional pressure on the government expenditure and exchequer. Government has to finance this subsidy by borrowing from financial institutions may be local or foreign.

Prior studies used the OLS model to estimate the relationship between firm value and corporate governance but in the wrong way. This may have been due to problems with the model's specifications which led to the wrong empirical results. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the artificial neural network (ANN) model is better than the OLS model. Moreover, we will examine whether a nonlinear model created by an artificial neural network (ANN) model will perform the best in predicting firm value. The empirical results indicate that the proposed neural network model can forecast firm values more accurately and have better explanatory power than the conventional OLS model. Even after 100 epochs of iterative simulation, the neural network still outperforms the OLS model in terms of explaining the training sample, verification sample, testing sample, and the holdout sample, with the confidence levels ranging from 99%~100%. The forecasted results are also tested using differential analysis. It is discovered that the MSE is extremely low, meaning that the accuracy of the neural network model is very high.

The contents of the database include integrated financial information from listed and over-the-counter firms used as investment indicators. In this study, the reference indicators of the zones are adopted as financial reference database for enterprises, and are used to verify the accuracy of predicted enterprise financial distress. The study applies logistic regression to build financial distress warning models. Traditional regression and logistic regression models are defined as Models 1 and 2, respectively. Key study indicators are selected and evaluated from financially distressed companies. Next, data collection of sample companies included two pre-financial distress periods (Period 1 and Period 2). Results demonstrate that the discrimination rate of financial distress of enterprises with our reference indicators appears to be too low when compared with outcomes using similar methodology in recent literature. However, using further tests with logistic regression model analysis, evidence from our study shows that ""debt ratio"" and ""operating cash flow,"" both financial indicators, are the variables with the most predictive power and validity. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Financial distress warning model; Financial reference database; Logistic regression,
Fiscal revenue consideration for potential tax treaties in AFTA: Theoretical exercise and application on Thailand's data,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77958131472&partnerID=40&md5=b74cee9f69b663c41b4835acbb16add5,"Along with various initiatives to intensify ASEAN integration and ASEAN Free Trade Area, the long term trend of intra-ASEAN FDI inflows during the past two decades has shown a positive projection. Amidst this scenario, member countries compete in offering tax and tax-related incentives to attract investing multinational corporations. Despite the statutory tax rates announced by jurisdictions, the realised corporate tax expenses are revealed by their effective tax rates. Theoretical exercise addresses the nonoptimality of the current competitive tax policy packages offered by most developing countries. The model considers governments' tax policy designs and investment decisions of multinationals in terms of transfer pricing decision within a free trade area. The equilibrium tax rates in competing and co-operative regimes are illustrated. The application empirically investigates Thailand's effective corporate tax rates calculated from publicly available financial information of 240 companies listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand during 2005- 2008 and their contribution to the country's corporate fiscal revenue. Panel regression across industries suggests that, considering potential tax treaties within ASEAN Free Trade Area, the overall current competitive effective tax rates can still be raised to increase the joint fiscal revenue. Interestingly, the effective tax rates calculated have gradually increased over the last few years. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Corporate taxes; Fiscal revenue; Tax treaties,

The estimation of vector error correction model based on VAR indicates the existence of long-run bidirectional causality between money supply and output and unidirectional causality from price level to money supply and output. But, in the short-run the bidirectional causality exists between money supply and price level and unidirectional causality exists from output to price level.

We find a positive relationship between the idiosyncratic risk (i.e. unsystematic risk) and return during low and medium volatility states. However, this positive relationship tends to disappear during high volatility states. In addition, our analysis suggests that idiosyncratic risk has no forecasting power over SRI future returns. Overall, our findings imply that SRI investors are rewarded for bearing the additional SRI specific risk (idiosyncratic risk) when the market is less volatile.

To accomplish this objective the twoways random effect models were carried out for annual time series from 2000 to 2006 for 32 countries. The first contribution of this paper is to extent the previous studies related to Turkish tourism demand using additional explanatory variables and including more countries in panel data set.

To our best knowledge, this will be the first study to investigate the effect of the official visits of President and Prime Minister on tourism demand.The results from the two-ways random effect models show that real income of sending countries, trade value between sending countries and Turkey and accommodation capacity are positively related with tourism demand. Distance between sending countries and Turkey is negatively related with tourism demand. However, contrary to expectations, relative prices and reel exchange rate have positive relationship with tourism demand. If it is thought that Turkey offers cheap holiday packages due to its low cost of living this result may not be surprise.

During the period of analysis, there were more mutual fund managers with significantly negative riskadjusted performances than those with significantly positive performances. This implies that the majority of mutual fund managers do not have special capabilities of beating the markets. Findings also show that Grinblatt and Titman's measures are significant but negative for growth and growth and income funds. This implies that fund managers do not have a special capability of outperforming benchmarks. Most of characteristic selectivity, characteristic timing, and average style measures are insignificant, except the average style for small-cap funds. Overall, the test results are not in favor of the assessment of fund managers' ability. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",And average style measures; Carhart's four-factor model; Characteristic selectivity; Characteristic timing; Jensen's alpha; Mutual fund performance,
The cost of financial intermediation in the banking sector of Jordan,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78349257390&partnerID=40&md5=e6fb30ae35ddf43a6ff46a7ebe97dc8c,"This study investigates the cost of financial intermediation in the banking sector of Jordan over the 2001-2008 period. It assesses to what extent the relatively high and escalating bank interest margins, in this sector, can be attributed to low efficiency or noncompetitive market conditions, controlling for the bank specific and macroeconomic environment factors. Based on a sample consists of all the banks operating in Jordan over the study period, a variety of widely used econometric models are estimated to discern the determinants of net interest margins. The results indicate that the banking sector in Jordan is on a virtuous path as the high and increasing levels of interest margins are derived mainly from increasing efficiency levels and not related to monopolistic or market powers. The results also show that the bank specific variables, mainly the capital adequacy ratio and the loans to total asset ratio are among the factors that reinforce the observed levels of interest margins. Therefore, the policymakers should expand the ongoing deregulation efforts aiming to enhance the levels of operating efficiency and promote the market competitiveness. In particular, new policies should be directed at encouraging market entry and abolishing the legal and regulatory obstacles to competition. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Competition; Cost efficiency; Emerging markets; Interest Margins; Jordan; Scale-efficiency; The efficient structure hypothesis; The relative market power; X-efficiency,

The two stage least squares method was employed to estimate the system. The reduced form of the growth model was singled out for longrun cointegration and causality test and no evidence of cointegration was eventually detected. Our results show that the expenditure decision of the government is significantly determined by government revenue and one-year lag of government expenditure. However, government expenditure was found wanting in catalyzing the growth of the economy. The results also reveal that money supply is a positive and significant function of prices and also granger causes prices with no reverse or feed back effect. The stock of money exerts a positive and significant influence on the growth of the economy while prices are found to have a significant reducing effect on the real GDP growth. The researchers therefore recommend that government should step up its expenditures with strong supervision and control to ensure that budgeted fund is actually committed to its proper use. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Cointegration; Government expenditure; Instrumental variables; Money supply; Prices and output; Simultaneous equation,

We also intend to take into account the possiblity of reverse causality in the innovation-performance relationship. The analysis includes the two adoption behaviours, first mover and imitator, where the results validate the theory of first mover advantage in a specific context of an emerging country. We find evidence that the first mover initiative in product innovation improves profitability while process initiative has a positive effect on profitability and efficiency. Banks that imitate are less profitable and less efficient than first movers. We find moreover the evidence that only the initiatives of first movers in financial innovation influence notably the spread policy pursued by the banks. Being a first mover gives the bank a competitive advantage and a larger market share than imitators. The first movers innovating in credit are likely to increase the volume of delinquent loans less than the imitators. In addition, the development of a risk appreciation system helps bank to reduce the credit risk, albeit less significantly among imitators. Also, we find that the emerging Tunisian market is more receptive to first mover adoption of new technologies. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",First mover; Imitation; Performance; Process innovation; Product innovation,

The results indicate that other than firm characteristics, concern with private benefit (including cash flow right and control right) is the most important influence in explaining the offer price discount. Measuring private benefits in terms of both control rights and cash flow rights for insiders and outsiders, we find that ownership has much greater influence on pricing than control rights, suggesting that the main source of private benefit comes from ownership rather than control rights. Furthermore, insiders buy at a discount when their ownership is lower than 5%, but are willing to pay more to increase their private benefit only if their ownership is in the 5% ~ 25% range. Finally, we find that consistent with the literature in corporate governance, the deviation between control rights and ownership appears more meaningful to insiders than level of control in private equity offerings. © Euro Journals Publishing, Inc.",Cash flow right; Control right; Private benefits; Private placement discount,

There is strong linkage between asset and liability accounts of Indian banks. But over the period of time there is decline in canonical correlation, indicating lower dependency between asset and liability accounts. The decline is more pronounced in case of foreign banks as they are largely exposed to off balance sheet activities.

However, whereas there is some theoretical literature on the effects of financial innovation on monetary policy transmission mechanism, little empirical evidence exists on these relationships particularly in Kenya. This paper addresses this gap by empirically examining the effect of financial innovation on monetary policy transmission focusing on the interest rate channel through which the Central Bank implements monetary policy. The study used Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) and monthly data covering the period, 1996-2007 and established that financial innovation dampens the interest rate channel of monetary transmission mechanism. The paper concludes that financial innovation poses complex challenges to the conduct of monetary policy which would necessitate constant revision of policy and instruments, targeting frameworks and operating procedures to enhance monetary policy effectiveness. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",,

Optimal hedging on spot indexes with a duration-dependent Markov-switching model,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77957704536&partnerID=40&md5=83eda528ad90b0eee5909d78af59a8c3,"This study introduces a duration-dependent Markov-switching vector autoregression (DDMSVAR) model to perform futures hedging on major spot indexes around the world. The transition probabilities of DDMSVAR models are time-varying depending the duration lasted on a state, which are good at modeling duration-dependent business cycles and market conditions. By Gibbs sampling from the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, the model parameters and state variables are accurately estimated. The portfolio implied by the optimal hedge ratio is constructed and compared with those of DCC-GARCH and BEKK-GARCH models. The empirical results indicate that the DDMSVAR model significantly outperforms DCC-GARCH and BEKK-GARCH models and achieves better risk reduction over 50% on average. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Duration-dependent markov-switching model; Financial econometrics; Financial hedge; MCMC,

This study has adopted the approach of combining the dynamism of capital structure and the impact of stock market development on firms financing choices. The GCC countries are non-tax paying entities which make them an interesting case to investigate whether the determinants of the capital structure of firms operating in these markets are similar to those operating in the developed and industrial countries. Also, there is no single published study which examines and compares the capital structure of firms listed in the GCC stock markets or the stock markets development and firms financing choice in these countries.

The study employs Interest Rate Spreads (IRS) as the dependent variable and domestic interest rate which is the difference between average interest rate earned on interest earning assets (loans) and average interest rate paid on deposits. This investigation captures both the long run and the short run dynamics of domestic interest rate behaviour by estimating an error correction model (ECM) using the Engle-Granger methodology with discovery of an appropriate negative ECM term which is significant and less than one. Inflation rate adjustment to the long-run equilibrium is the fastest while exchange rate adjustment towards equilibrium is the slowest. Econometric analysis notwithstanding suggests that as the Nigerian financial sector integrates more with global markets, returns on foreign assets will play a significant role in the determination of domestic interest rates.

If prices are determined rationally, then the only new information will cause them to change. Indeed, if stock movement were predictable, that would be damming evidence of stock market inefficiency because the ability to predicate prices would indicate that all available information was not already reflected in stock prices.

Our theoretical model uses Gram-Charlier series expansion to approximate the distribution of the logarithm of stock prices, and incorporates non-normal skewness and kurtosis terms in the adjusted option price; we also estimate the risk-neutral moments by numerically solving the nonlinear leastsquares problem. Investigation of the influence of firm-specific variables on the slope of implied volatility of individual stock options indicates that for firms whose stock return is more volatile the slope of the smile is less negative. For firms with higher leverage, of larger size, larger beta, and larger traded volume the smile tends to have a more negative slope. With regard to endogenous variables, the more negative the risk-neutral skewness, the steeper (more negative) the slope of the smile will be, and the greater the risk-neutral kurtosis, the flatter the slope of the smile. For the market-wide variables, greater volatility in the market is associated with a smile of steeper slope; the more negative skewness of the FTSE 100 index options, the steeper the slope of the smile is for individual stock options, and the greater the kurtosis of the FTSE 100 index options, the flatter the slope of the smile for individual stock options. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Gram-Charlier Series Expansion; Implied Volatility Skew; Leverage Effect; Risk-Neutral Distribution; Risk-Neutral Kurtosis; Risk-Neutral Skewness,

However, a significant relationship between stock prices and real GDP was not found. Our results suggest that China's stock market is likely to be less efficient than those in the U.S. and other developed countries and is somewhat separated from the real economy of China. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",China; EGARCH model; Granger causality; LA-VAR model; Stock market volatility,

Does education alleviate poverty?

Education plays a vital role in poverty alleviation. Therefore, it is important to investigate that whether different levels of education or literacy cause to alleviate poverty. The major objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of different levels of education and literacy on the incidence of poverty in Pakistan. Our results suggest that poverty alleviation process would be accelerated if resources are targeted at education sector especially in higher education. Pakistan presents a paradoxical situation. Until the late 1980s Pakistan had achieved a spectacular record of economic growth and reduced incidence of poverty remarkably, but the country had horrible social indicators. However when social indicators began to improve in the 1990s for a variety of reasons, both internally and externally driven, the average rate of economic growth declined. Contrary to the said situation, the general perception about Education is that the role of education in poverty alleviation, in close co-operation with other social sectors, is crucial. This paper is mainly intended to explore the reality that to what extent education is affective in poverty alleviation in Pakistan. In addition, some important macroeconomic variables have also been taken understudy to find out the reality of the problem. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Economic growth; Education; Inflation; Openness; Pakistan; Poverty,

This paper is a modest attempt to look at the economic issues concerning public-private partnership. We present a theoretical model that considers optimizing behaviour of workers, management and the trade union in a work scenario where possibility of retrenchment exists as a disciplining device. It is shown that even with identical optimizing behaviour on the part of the management in both private and public sector, an excess of rules and regulation can lead to a lower labour productivity in public sector and a public-private partnership can make an improvement in this regard. The paper then corroborates the observations of the theoretical models with a case study of public- private partnership in health services. A primary health centre in a rural area in India, instead of running an ambulance service itself, gives the ambulance to a local agency, which runs the service. In this case study we find that although the service cannot be provided either at the public level or at the private level, a public-private partnership ensures the successful provision of the service. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",,

It found that aggregate import demand is positively affected by real gross domestic product suggesting that import demand in Pakistan is growth driven. Further it found that relative price of imports may not decrease the import demand, which is quite obvious for growth driven economy. It also found that real depreciation of local currency and volatility of real effective exchange rate has no effect to decrease import demand in Pakistan in the long run.

According to the classical and neoclassical economics, the equilibrium wage is determined by the intersection of supply and demand for labour. However, the labour market is shown as peculiar and different from other types of market. Several factors have been indicated to have effect on wages and productivity which have mostly been ignored. Among other, race, gender, age, education, training, firm size and ownership of firms are the important factors. In this research, empirical studies were categorized into three groups, namely gender and productivity, age and productivity, and education and productivity. These empirical studies showed that there was a positive relation between productivity and real wages. For instance, male and female workers and their age have different effects on wages and productivity. Similarly, the wage premium was found to increase with the years of schooling, and higher education was shown to yield higher productivity. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",,

Based on a unique firm-level panel data set of more than 3950 French firms from several industries, the results reveal that the timing of the going public decision is relevant. It seems that firms choose the appropriate window to go public, and that generally coincides with a peak of performance which is not maintained after the event. Consistent with prior share price based evidence, we find that the operating performance of French IPOs typically deteriorates over the first five postlisting years. In addition, firms appear to go public to improve their balance sheet after a period of high growth, in order to diminish the debt ratio. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Average treatment effect on the treated; Initial public offerings; Operating performance; Paris stock exchange; Propensity score matching,

We propose that in emerging markets the households live close to the level of subsistence and hardly have any funds for saving purposes. Hence, they believe that the future is uncertain rather than risky. In such economies, response of households to survey questions should depend on past information and current economic outlook rather than the expectations of future paths of consumption (and growth). So, consumer sentiment should be modeled with high frequency financial market variables such as interest rates, exchange rates and the stock exchange index. We utilize this relationship for the emerging economy of Turkey. Employing weekly data for the period of January 2003 - January 2008, this study empirically shows the existence of cointegration between consumer confidence and the financial market variables of interest. Therefore, we believe that this is a significant insight for emerging markets where consumer confidence could be viewed as an endogenous variable sensitive to financial market variables rather than the future outlook of the economy. © Euro Journals Publishing, Inc.",Cointegration; Consumer confidence; Emerging market; Financial market variables,

Securitization has enabled mortgage corporations (new entrants solely rely on securitization funding) to intensify competition in the mortgage market with traditional lenders from 1994 to 2003. Responding to the heightened competition, banks and building societies largely reduced their yield spreads (from nearly 400 basis points to 150 basis points). However, there is no study to address how and extent securitization contributed to their reductions. Cointegration tests find positive relationships between bank and building society yield spreads and market concentration, but negative relationships between their spreads and securitization.

Our findings suggest that the mixed findings in the literature are likely the results of aggregating highand low-performing stocks and thus the literature is unable to accurately identify the existence of an unstable momentum effect in the stock market. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Momentum effect; Quantile regression; Stock return,
The relationship between voting power and stock exchange market: The case of Turkey,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77957708295&partnerID=40&md5=fa3ee9a2b8238853af2737690ceb9576,"This study aims to analyze the effect of government's voting power in political decision making process on stock exchange market in Turkey. Therefore, we hypothesize that the change in government's voting power in political decision making process significantly affects the composite index of Istanbul stock exchange market. To do so, we generated four distinct monthly voting power indices by using the normalized Banzhaf power index technique for the period of 1987:12-2007:7. Based on the results from multivariate OLS analyses we found that government's voting power index, voting power index of political party founding the government, and cumulative voting power index have statistically significant positive impact on the composite index of Istanbul stock exchange market whereas voting power index of main opposition party has statistically significant negative impact.",Normalized banzhaf index; Political decision making; Stock exchange market; Voting power,

A theoretical model is used to measure the loss to society by considering some important macroeconomic variables and their deviations from the target ones. Then, by determining (measuring) the annual losses, one can visualize the status of the economy. The global uncertainty (terrorism, wars, and the volatility of the financial markets) has resulted in increased gold prices, depreciation of the dollar stemming from U.S. debts and deficits, heightened prices of oil due to speculation which has created a ""commodity bubble"" (even in food), and a reduction in income, which has negatively affected the financial markets. The deregulation in financial markets and institutions as well as the easy money policy had increased lending, liquidity, greed, ""innovations"", corruption, speculation, and prices in financial and real assets (stocks and real estate, housing) which caused two other enormous bubbles, ""stocks bubble"" and ""housing bubble"". Some people (""the world's planners"") burst the bubbles in 2008, creating the worst housing and financial crisis, which in 2009 was followed by the most severe recession in modern economic history. The western free-market (laissez-faire, laissez-passer) economies have been led in deep recessions, enormous unemployment, annihilation of their wealth, tremendous debts, complete distrust for the financial markets, huge social problems, and a new cold war, which were more or less predictable; hence, the west faces an absolutely uncertain future. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Estimation; Forecasting and other model applications; Information and market efficiency: Event studies; International policy coordination; Open economy macroeconomics; Time-series models,

Despite increasing import penetration, the paper shows that employment has increased across all manufacturing industries. Data from Egypt's labor market survey confirm that layoffs as a result of trade liberalization is not among the factors responsible for unemployment. On the other hand, regression analysis shows that the reduction in tariffs and increasing export orientation has been associated with an increase in wages in manufacturing industries though the role of export orientation in influencing poor wages has not been significant. Meanwhile, quantile regressions reveal that the impact of both the reduction in tariffs and increase in export orientation has not been uniform across the different quantiles of the wage distribution. The paper further points out to the possibility that further reduction of trade barriers might lead to high adjustment costs in terms of long spells of unemployment or lower pay on grounds of old age and low educational attainment of Egypt's work force. Adjustment policies in the form of direct job search assistance as country experience illustrates is considered to be the most appropriate form of adjustment assistance.© EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Adjustment assistance; Adjustment costs; Employment; Trade liberalization; Wages,

Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Thailand will have the high and sustained second demographic dividend due to low asset accumulation of working age population, leading to low intergenerational transfer to finance consumption of old age population.

This study addresses the research gap via extensive literature review and conducting empirical surveys with an embedded qualitative field study among the life insurance enterprises in Taiwan. The findings revealed that most of the respondents agreed that KM would improve their job performance in enhancing service quality, saving time and being more effective at work, and the opinions from senior management played an important role in having KM into place.

We further examined the oneyear short-term persistence on every mutual fund house from 1990 to 2005 by using twoway contingency table. At the same time, we had conducted simulation strategies that based on one-year persistence performance of 50 top performing funds and the returns of investing were examined over the next 36 months. The overall results documented the satisfactory performance of mutual fund in Malaysia. Nonetheless, no apparent significant performance persistence was found for mutual funds as a whole and mutual fund houses. Interestingly, the results showed mean returns reversion for mutual funds by using both non-parametric methodology and simulation strategies. The results also showed that simulated returns from investing in top performing funds beat the benchmark returns. Equity fund styles reported highest simulated returns among other fund styles such as index and bond funds styles.

When the institutional ownership is less than 81.2%, I find that there is no relationship between institutional ownership and Tobin's Q.

For this, a theoretical model has been developed which is an improvisation of Dorfman-Steiner's model (1954) and Lee's model (2002). The results of the theoretical model show that sign of the relationship between industry advertising intensity and concentration depends upon whether the firms which enjoy high revenue market share are more advertising competent than the firms which are having low market share. The empirical results show that there is a positive relationship between industry advertising intensity and market concentration in the Indian consumer goods and services sector. The empirical results further show that for a given level of concentration, the industries which earn lower price-cost margins engage themselves more rigorously in advertising activity than the industries which earn higher price-cost margins. The results also show that the industries which have relatively small market size and/or have large investment in total assets incur higher advertising expenditure as a percentage of sales than the industries which have relatively large market size and/or relatively small investment in total assets.

Empirical results found no difference by gender to investor propensity to take risk, nor in cognitive perception of such. However, higher and lower perceptions of risk were indicated by investors according to their personal investment experience. Investors with little experience in stocks and structured notes were found to have significantly heightened perception of risk. Thus the model proposed is relevant in finding a positive correlation between experience and propensity of risk, though the understanding of such remains uncertain. In respect to financial products other than mutual funds, investor propensity and perception of risk tend to show a negative correlation. Similarly, investor perceptions of risk and expected returns indicate a significant negative correlation.

Even though the country has limited resources to do this, its strategic position and stable situation compared with its neighbour attracted many companies and investors to establish their entrepreneurs in Jordan. Such a flourish in the country economy and the rapidly growing industries within it, raise the need for researches and studies to be conducted about Jordan and its people. For this reason, marketer managers spare no efforts to understand consumers in Jordan, and to specify their needs. Thus, this research came to cover an important subject within the consumer behaviour, which is the effect of brand names on the consumers' choice between alternatives. Major objective for this research was to determine if there is a significant effect of familiar brand names on the consumer behaviour. Other objectives, which are related to the first one, were to find if there is a relation between the customer demographic profile and the extent to which he/she is affected by the product brand name, and finally to identify the way Jordanian customers perceive strong brand names. In order to attain the study purposes, a self administered questionnaire containing eighteen items has been designed; all efforts have been done to make the questionnaire as much reliable and valid as possible. It has been distributed to a judgmental sample of 125 respondents. However, 104 useable questionnaires have been analysed using the (SPSS) software. Results found that customers in Jordan really consider the product brand name as an important cue while making their buying decision. But in the other side, no relation between the customers' demographic profile and the level of brand name significance has been founded. Finally, Jordanian customers are appreciating the product with strong brand names, they said it worth its price and it's not that expensive. Also they agreed that it is more trustworthy and have better quality than other products without brand names or with unknown brand names. At the end, we also found that the majority of the research participants think that using or buying products carrying well known brand names reflect higher social status. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Brand names; Consumer behavior; Jordan; Research questions,

We find that the most common combination of exposed hedged is of interest rate and currency exchange rates. Second, and contrary to previous studies, our paper provides a distinctive methodological contribution according to the determination of hedging variables. More precisely, the recourse to performance models tested on two sub-samples: those which hedge risks and those which not hedge, will enable to determine the distinctive and relevant variables for carrying out a hedging strategy. The results show that the probability of hedging is positively related to tax loss carry forwards.

We try to focus more on the interactions between these factors and their effects on the credit rating target. We also examine whether changes of observed credit rating are explained by deviations from fixed target. Based on a sample of 571 American firms, covering 1995-2007 period, our results reveal that some governance mechanisms and financial attributes are used as means by managers to achieve desired credit rating. Moreover, we deduce that firms first set credit ratings targets and then make decisions to bring their credit ratings to those fixed. Also, we found that the deviations from the target credit ratings provide different information and can influence the firm's financing choices. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Credit rating; Credit rating changes; Financial attributes; Governance mechanisms; Rating targets,

In addition to these empirical studies, many literatures build theoretical models to evaluate franchise contracts. However, few authors construct dynamic models and take strategic problems into account when investors join a franchise system. For example, should an investor join a franchise system and when is the best time to franchise? Differing from previous studies, this paper uses a real options approach to construct a dynamic model to value the decisions of investors in franchise contracts. In the process of evaluation, this paper also applies game theory to describe a relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee. In the dynamic model, the values of the franchisor and the franchisee will be affected by the uncertainty of revenues. With the real options approach, this study can derive closed-form solutions of franchise options and timing to invest in the franchise contracts, which can not be derived by traditional economic models. This paper finds that larger franchise costs, higher product market uncertainty, and smaller synergy effect tend to delay franchise. In addition, the royalties will be high when franchise fees are small and synergy effects are large. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Franchise contract; Franchise timing; Game theory; Real options; Royalty,

"New financial analysis approach using instrumental variables for measuring the effect of remittances with respect to labour migration, workers' remittances and economic activity",2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955722550&partnerID=40&md5=f2f5228217345b24f0eb9d4af8195dae,"The first concern of this paper is to examine the association between governmental intervention in labour market and migration on one hand and the trajectory of workers' remittances on the other. The second and third questions that this paper tries to answer are: Do workers' remittances boost economic activity? And, what methodology can be suggested to estimate the impact of workers' remittances on economic activity? Reviewing the government policies in Jordan with respect to labour market and migration since 1970 till 2003 reveals that the Jordanian labour market in recent years is more regulated, i.e., government intervenes in labour market much more during the reform period in comparison with the pre-reform period. In the light of this fact, workers' remittances during the reform period grew at higher rates than those prevailed during the pre-reform period. This finding completely contradicts the neo-liberalist argument that emphasizes the negative influence of government intervention in markets, amongst which is the labour market. The study, also, shows the magnitude of remittances' effect on the current account side of the Balance of Payments. This research work suggests a new methodology to estimate the 'actual net effect' of remittances on economic activity. In this context, the impact of net remittances on private consumption, investment expenditure, government expenditure and net exports was estimated. The predicted values of these estimates were taken as 'instrumental variables' to find that portion of GDP which is generated by remittances through four channels, namely private consumption, investment expenditure, government expenditure and net exports. The final results of the study showed that net remittances have positive and significant effects on private consumption, investment expenditure, government expenditure and a negative effect on net exports. The total effect of remittances on GDP, however, is positive. The results also suggest that Jordanian emigrants' remittances had played a crucial role in the very high consumption pattern, which resulted in increasing imports of final goods and hence exacerbating trade deficit. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Government expenditure; Instrumental variables; Investment expenditure; Labour market; Net exports; Private consumption; Remittances,

However, due to its strong growth in domestic energy demand and limitations in oil production, oil exports, and thus oil revenue, are steadily decreasing. There are two ways to tackle this problem. One is by increasing oil production, and the other one by reducing domestic oil consumption. The latter, however, requires a drastic change in Iran's domestic energy policy. Iran's current energy policy is based on petroleum product prices that are below the cost of production, which has resulted in implicit subsidies on energy in excess of 10 billion US$ per year. In this paper, we analyze the potential for domestic energy savings and discuss policy measures to achieve these, with drastic energy price increases at its core. We will show that this policy will increase Iran's export capacity considerably, allow its domestic energy sector to improve, and, if implemented correctly, will reduce inflation. Since policy measures that reduce domestic energy use strongly affect the income distribution, defining a migration path to an economically sustainable energy policy is difficult and will lead to social tensions. However, as we will show, without drastic changes in its domestic energy policy Iran's export capacity will within the next twenty years be reduced to only a fraction of its current capacity, which will result in even larger economic and social problems and will require even more drastic solutions. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Energy demand; Export revenues; Fuel policy; Petroleum products prices; Subsidies,

In the framework of production technology we firstly show that under production certainty and competitive market both PLS and interest based systems are efficient and just. However, under an uncertain situation due to a productivity shock, we prove that only the PLS system is just, since it fairly distributes the risk at individual level amongst lender and borrower. We verify our result by quantifying the effects on income distribution for both lender and borrower. Two indicators, namely the standard error of distribution and Gini ratio are considered. We also propose a mechanism that will improve the performance of a PLS system from capital owners perspective by introducing a so-called risk pooling bank. We prove that such a bank absorbs all the risk encountered by the capital owners and thus maintains their income distribution, and at the same time reduces the risk faced by borrowers. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Income distribution; Islamic banking; Profit-loss sharing; Risk pooling agent,

This study provides evidence that a contractionary monetary policy has a larger absolute impact than an expansionary policy. Moreover, the effects of an expansionary policy are gradually mitigated when the inflation rate is increasing (except in Malaysia). These findings imply that monetary authorities must consider not only the behaviour of the inflation process but also the fact that not all economies can react in a similar way to expansionary and contractionary monetary policy shocks. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",ASEAN; Asymmetry; Markov-switching; Monetary policy,

Nonparametric regression estimation has been a fundamental tool for data analysis. Having noisy data, observed at certain time or design points, the aim of the present article is to approximate the data by a function with less restricted assumptions. The function bears the ability to deal the situation without making the rigid parametric form. Regardless usual assumptions of regression models, the assumption of smoothness and simplicity are made instead. Following Hardle (1990), we have used kernel estimation for the onion yield data from four Australian localities.

Implication of inside-debt among small- and medium-size enterprises,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955719772&partnerID=40&md5=83ed0d159d4708390c4ef44a51da5e02,"Inside-debt, funds contributed by owners or households to a firm, form a significant part of firms' total funding, especially among small privately held companies. In the literature inside-debt is commonly recognized as part of internal equity; this leads to the conclusion that inside-debt must not have any significant impact on firms' financial risk and economic behavior different from book equity. The purpose of the research study is to investigate whether this commonly accepted view holds or not. The paper proposes two frameworks that the use of inside-debt is either motivated by firm's higher risk profile perceived by owners or it provides an effective tool to monitor business performance and thereby has positive impact on a firm's profitability. The paper analyses relations between the use of inside-debt and selected firm-specific financial determinants. As results show, there are significant differences between inside-debt users and non-users. Fundamental findings include that inside-debt users are significantly more leveraged firms (suggesting that the use of inside-debt does not limit access to external credit) and exhibit higher business risk profile. The results expand our understanding of capital structure development among small firms and reveal different implications between inside-debt and book equity. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Capital structure; Inside equity; Inside-debt; Small firms,

The results indicate that the cash conversion cycle, net trade cycle and inventory turnover in days are significantly affecting the performance of the firms. The manufacturing firms are in general facing problems with their collection and payment policies. Moreover, the financial leverage, sales growth and firm size also have significant effect on the firm's profitability. The study also concludes that firms in Pakistan are following conservative working capital management policy and the firms are needed to concentrate and improve their collection and payment policy. The effective policies must be formulated for the individual components of working capital. Furthermore, efficient Management and financing of working capital (current assets and current liabilities) can increase the operating profitability of manufacturing firms.

Banks are starting to understand the relevance and importance of sharing knowledge and are beginning to appreciate knowledge as the most significant and valued asset that leads to organisational performance. As a result, it has been anticipated that promising motivational factors would help in encouraging the need for employees to share not only crucial knowledge but new knowledge to further ensure that the banking industry possess the competitive edge that they are looking for. This paper investigates and thoroughly examines the motivational factors which covers both intrinsic (trust, learning, behaviour) and extrinsic factors (organisation culture, reward system information technology) that encourages the widespread sharing of knowledge among bank employees especially in the dynamic and ever-growing banking sector in Malaysia. Our research shows that motivational factors and knowledge sharing process (by applying Nonaka's SECI model), directly had a significant influence and impact in determining the success of the sharing of warranted knowledge among bank employees in achieving desirable organizational competitiveness. The research findings provide useful information and help deepen the understanding of banks in motivating their employees' tendencies to engage in knowledge sharing practices. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Banks; Knowledge sharing; Knowledge sharing process; Motivational factors; SECI model,

The findings indicate that there exists a bidirectional causal feedback relationship between the real estate and stock price indexes in the short term and an asymmetric price transmission between the real estate and stock price indexes in the long term. When the market imbalance shrinks, the speed with which the markets resume long-term equilibrium is slower whereas when the market imbalance widens, the speed with which the markets resume long-term equilibrium is faster. However, the error correction terms are only significant in the real estate market. This paper makes it easier for investors to predict the performance of one market from that of another and serves as a reference for allocations of investment portfolios.

We estimate the information share using a vector error correction model (VECM) and the long-run impact matrix obtained in a vector moving average (VMA) representation of the VECM, as developed by Grammig, Melvin, and Schlag (2005). We find that price discovery of POSCO stock occurs mostly in the home market, the KRX, and the Korean won/Japanese yen exchange rate is exogenous with respect to POSCO stock prices on the KRX and the TSE. We also find that this result is robust regardless of the ordering of the prices in the Cholesky factorization.

In addition, we explore whether the investors' learning effect changed. The Co-integration of Engle and Granger (1987) is applied to test the long-term equilibrium between the TB and ED futures. Additionally, in order to consider the heteroskedasticity of the TB and ED futures prices, the bivariate EGARCH Model with the Error Correction Model (ECM) techniques is utilized to examine the short-term dynamic interactions of price and volatility between the TB and ED futures markets. Empirical results indicate that the lead-lag (feedback) relationships exist between TB and ED futures prices (or returns) after the stock crashes. Additionally, there exists a volatility asymmetry in both TB and ED futures markets with volatility spillovers to the other market after the stock crashes, implying that the speeds of the response for good news and bad news are different in both markets.

Is there a bank lending channel of monetary policy in Kenya?,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955725842&partnerID=40&md5=367c82df76d62324dd17d3d12e573197,"The objective of the study is to assess the importance of the bank lending channel in the transmission of monetary policy in Kenya. The lending view provides that a monetary tightening affects aggregate demand by shifting the loan supply schedule left. This reduction however may also be caused by depressed demand for loans through the conventional interest rate channel. To avoid this ambiguity, we test the lending channel using a vector error correction model in a frame work that allows the identification of the shifts of demand and supply schedules in the bank loan market. In this way the identification problem inherent in approaches based on aggregate data is explicitly addressed. Impulse responses are used to analyze the impact of a monetary policy shock on loan quantity, loan price and real output.

Our main contributions are first we consider the firm's internal effect in the dynamic adjustment process to an equilibrium state; and second we examine the characteristics of the proposed model in different industry and country. Empirical results show the proposed model indeed improves the explaining ability than previous studies and firm's internal effect for the dynamic adjustment process of financial ratios has significant effect.

Depository banks were trapped high inflation into cost inefficiency: The Turkish experience,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955720314&partnerID=40&md5=cbbe70d7cd1c8d47fcb6475b969a11c8,"Turkey embraced its worst banking crisis in the year 2001 after a long history of high inflation. Only one-third of the private domestic banks could survive immediately before and then after the crisis, mainly because of cost inefficiencies. We argue that many bank managers were trapped into cost inefficiencies during the high inflation years because they over-expanded with many new branches, looking for additional costly scarce funds in order to invest in government's securities for exuberant profits. Based on a stochastic total cost frontier with inefficiency effects (CIE) model, bank samples provide strong evidence that investing more in government securities during high inflation periods is highly significant in explaning cost inefficiency differentials among banks, in contrast to low inflation periods. A policy implication is that when inflation subsides rapidly, banks which invest heavily in government securities under high inflation are confronted with financial deterioration since they cannot adjust their cost structure, e.g., by closing several of their branches, in line with revenue losses. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Cost inefficiency; Inflation; Turkish depository banks,

Tobin's Q is used as a proxy for firm value. We find that there are three threshold effects between family ownership and firm value. These are 0.075%, 31.76% and 33.61%.When the family ownership is less than 0.075%, Tobin's Q decreases by 257.71%, with a 1% increase in the family ownership. On the other hand, Tobin's Q increases by 0.78% when the family ownership is between 0.075% and 31.76%. Hence it has a 1% increase in the family ownership. Tobin's Q increases by 1.67% with a 1% increase in the family ownership when the family ownership is between 31.76% and 33.61%. However, Tobin's Q increases by 0.51% with a 1% increase in the family ownership when the family ownership is greater than 33.61%. We therefore conclude that there must be an optimal family ownership between 31.76% and 33.61% because it is at this level when firm value is maximized.

In this study, we test whether or not the demutualization program resulted in better market performance using a wider range of market measures and larger sample sizes drawn from demutualized stock exchanges that are members of the World Federation of Exchanges and have undergone the demutualization program over the 1993-2004 period.

The analysis of factors affecting investment choices of households in turkey with multinomial logit model,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954282814&partnerID=40&md5=aeec4df9a2c9706927a3fa90211549b4,"Households don't spend all of their income but save some of them for various purposes. One of these purposes is to invest. The choice of investment instruments are affected not only by financial factors but also by socio-psychological factors. Revealing how individuals determine their investment choices in a world in which investment instruments are very diversified, will be useful to both portfolio managers and economic policy makers. In this paper, investment choices are classified into seven categories, and elements affecting investment choices are determined by analyzing with multinomial logit model the data obtained from 1300 public surveys conducted in the city of İstanbul in Turkey that can be accepted as a small sample of Turkey. The results show that investment choices of households are affected not only by economic factors but also by social and personal factors. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Households; Investment choices; Multinomial logit model; Turkey,
Does demutualization matter to the financial performance of stock exchanges? an investigation of demutualized member stock exchanges of the world federation of exchanges,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954282815&partnerID=40&md5=2a35d600e803795e8164541ba79014a8,"Traditionally world stock exchanges were run as mutuals or member customer-owned organizations raising capital from members and providing them services. Demutualization is a process by which such a member customer-owned cooperative or mutual organization is transformed into a shareholder-owned company raising capital with shares issued and providing services to customers as well as returns to shareholders. But ever since the demutualization of stock exchanges began and picked pace in the 1990s, debate ensued about the impact of this move on the performance of the stock exchanges. Prior studies in the literature on the impact of demutualization on the performance of stock exchanges focused on only a few market measures. Some used very small sample sizes. And others only examined the stock exchanges' performance relative to other listed firms in their market and to other initial public offerings. There is only one study that has tackled the impact of demutualization on the financial performance of demutualized / listed stock exchanges. Consequently the issue has remained controversial and open to debate. This study rigorously examines whether or not the demutualization program resulted in better financial performance using a common range of financial measures for samples of demutualized stock exchanges that are members of the World Federation of Exchanges that have undergone the demutualization program over the 1996-2004 period. By employing a matched-pairs methodology to examine 11 financial measures in the pre and post demutualization periods, and applying the Wilcoxon signed rank test and proportion test, the authors find empirical persuasive evidence that suggests that the demutualization programs do not improve the financial performance of demutualized stock exchanges. It is established that demutualization resulted in significant improvement in only four out of the eleven financial measures used to test for change in performance. This result was noted in the basic earning power, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), profit margin and return on asset (ROA). The research hypothesis that demutualization improves stock exchange financial performance is not however supported in the remaining financial measures; current ratio, debt equity ratio, debt ratio, fixed assets turnover, total assets turnover, return on equity (ROE) and return on capital employed (ROCE). Could the demutualization of stock exchanges have been over-hyped in the wave of liberalization and privatization? © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Capital markets; Demutualization; Financial markets; Financial performance; Stock exchanges,

Our goal is to compare the model with an SVM approach and classical GARCH, EGARCH and GJR models. The experimental results suggest that the proposed models can capture two different asymmetric effects of news impacts, and hence outperform the other models; particularly, the RVM based GJR generates a best ability for first stage forecast and the RVM based EGARCH is superior for the second stage forecast of HSI volatility, in terms of the evaluation metrics: RMSE, MSE, MAD, NMSE, and linear regression R squared. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",EGARCH; GARCH; GJR and forecasting volatility; Relevance vector machine; Support vector machine,

However, no research has been undertaken concerning the impact of the credit crunch on volatility clustering and leverage effects, both of which are known to permeate stock markets. From that respect, the current paper attempts to fill such a vacuum by using GARCH (1, 1), GJR and news impact curves techniques. Results show that GARCH fits all the stock markets with the exception of SEMDEX2. Volatility clustering is found to be pronounced chiefly for NASDAQ, DJIA and HANG SENG stock markets. Interestingly, in case of emerging markets such as JSE and SSEC, it transpired that leverage effects prevailed only in the post crisis period but not in the pre crisis era. Overall, findings suggest that the credit crunch has not only accentuated the level of volatility clustering but has also increased leverage effects for major international stock markets. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",GARCH; GJR; Leverage effects; News impact curve; Volatility clustering,

Currently, most of the optimal transfer pricing methods for establishing arm's length principles for multinational enterprises have been addressed in OECD's ""Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations"". These guidelines emphasize the establishment of a range of arm's length transactions through the comparability analysis and the economic analysis of transfer pricing transactions; a taxpayer's returns from transactions with related companies are then compared to the range of arm's length transactions. Currently the academic world is taking the initiative in the development of relevant models to describe corporate transfer pricing decisions or to measure the net income of corporate transfer pricing transactions. This research stems from these purposes and attempts to describe transfer pricing decisions in real practice through stringent modelling; this model is then used to measure the net income of transfer pricing transactions that took place among electronic industry participants who are publicly listed in the TSE or OTC in Taiwan. We further investigated the main factors that affect the levels of net income transferred by enterprises. Based on the empirical results of this research, we discovered that the impact of raw material costs is highly significant to the corporate transfer pricing decisions, and the magnitude of impacts vary depending on the allocation of net income from transfer pricing. We recommend that the tax administration detect corporate transfer pricing decisions by monitoring the weight of raw material costs in a company. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Net income model; Quantile regression; Transfer pricing,

In relation with the Inward Processing Regime (IPR) system, which was first implemented in Turkey in 1996, despite the increase in exports, imports also increase. The average share of imports made within the framework of IPR in total exports in the period 1996-2008 was 50%. In this study, the dependence of exports on imports is examined. For this purpose, imported input usage rates of net exporter firms within the framework of IPR in the period 1996-2008 are calculated.

The study therefore concludes that the relationship between the firms entrepreneurial orientation and their export marketing performance is weak in the Nigerian non-oil sector.

The primary data was analyzed using a censored logistic model while the secondary data was modeled using an error correction approach. The long run value of the all share price index in the time series model was obtained using a single equation approach that relates the dependent variable to fundamental values of its core explanatory variables. Two equations were thereafter estimated, the first showing the relationship of this long run all share price index with major indicators in the economy and the second showing the relationship of the actual value of the all share price index with same set (or augmented sets) of indicators. Data from the primary survey indicate that the key drivers of share prices, particularly for the boom period were neither broad macroeconomic indicators (though such factors as inflation rate and macro instability are noted to affect it) nor key indicators of the health of the firm. Prices were clearly shown to be much above levels that could have been determined by firm fundamentals. In contrast, stakeholders see price setting behaviour as dominant in the market aided by weak regulatory capacity of key institutions in charge of the market. From the secondary data, we find that while fundamental values of the ASPI are driven by monetary and relative price variables, actual values are driven by external sector variables and prices.

On the one hand, it is investigated which is the effect of macroeconomic factors in income growth, as defined by IS-LM, and on the other hand it is examined which is the relation between these factors and economic cycles. The aim of this paper goes further and examines whether the magnitude of the effect of these factors to GDP growth remains intact over time. The examination periods includes the years 1930-1949, 1950-1979 and 1980-2008. According to the results of the analysis, the government consumption expenditure growth is the most important factor that affects positively GDP growth. A change by 10% of Government consumption leads to 1.65% GDP growth. It is also examined which is the effect of Personal consumption expenditures to gross domestic product growth by breaking down personal consumption components, namely consumption for Durable goods, consumption for Nondurable goods and consumption for Services. A change in demand for Nondurable goods is found to be the major factor that affects GDP growth. This study also shows that the duration of crises is adversely affected by lowering interest rates while being equally affected by government consumption and private investments even after adjusting for different time periods. However, the effect of these factors is somewhat smaller after 1950, maybe due to increasing globalisation. The findings are interesting for policy makers. The empirical findings of this study indicate that the role of private investments for GDP growth may be over-rated among policy makers, given the low contribution of this factor to GDP growth. On the contrary, policies that aim in increasing role of the state may lead to higher GDP growth and smaller economic crises. In line with other studies it is also found that interest rate policy affects the duration of economic cycles. However it is found that there is no effect on long-term growth. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc.2010.",Business cycles; Consumption; Gdp; Government expenditure; Is-lm,

Any income arising from an international transaction shall be computed having regard to the arm's length price (ALP). The ALP shall be determined by any of the prescribed methods, being the most appropriate method. The present paper illustrates the practical aspects of the law regarding transfer pricing as it exists presently in India with the help of a case study. The relevant rules envisage determination of ALP by applying margins of each comparable company to the appropriate base of the enterprise. The regulations further provide that, where more than one price is determined by the most appropriate method, the ALP shall be taken to be the arithmetical mean of such prices. An alternative practical approach to arrive at such ALP is to compute the arithmetic mean of margins of comparable companies and apply the same to the appropriate base of the tested party to determine the ALP. The analysis shows that the mean GP/Sales of comparable companies is 33.71% while that of the PQR India (i.e., the tested party) is 44.20% during the year ended March 31, 2009 indicating that the prices of international transaction of PQR India conform to the arm's length standard prescribed under the Indian regulations. Further, under Category B, costs recharged by PQR Group to PQR India are included. All these costs represent actual amounts paid by PQR Group to independent third parties and are recovered from PQR India, on a cost-to-cost basis. Applying the comparable uncontrolled price method, these recharges conform to the arm's length standard prescribed under the Indian regulations. However, there are some practical problems arising out of the applications of transfer pricing regulations, which need to be addressed by the tax administrators as early as possible. These issues include absence of advance pricing agreements (APA) mechanism in India, data limitations, extremely wide definition of associated enterprises in India, stringent penalties, difficulties encountered while conducting economic analysis/benchmarking and many more. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Arms length price; International transactions; Tax laws; Transfer pricing,
Using financial indicator approach to construct a TSEC & OTC listed companies litigation warning model,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77950365750&partnerID=40&md5=3d222e2acfa42b1cf3f515240be0e939,"This study is designed to evaluate and understand the financial indicators of a firm with high litigation risk, from a comparison between prosecuted companies and non-prosecuted companies, so that we may construct a business litigation warning model by using Logistic regression. The empirical findings prove that some key characteristics such as rapidly decreased (or even minus) operation cash flow, higher debt ratio, poor marketing quality will put a firm under distress or keep a firm involved in litigation risks. In addition, the total prediction accuracy rate of the model, no matter whether it is in a training dataset or a testing dataset, reaches a peak (86.67% and 77.27% respectively) in the first quarter prior to prosecution, from which we may conclude that the closer it approaches the prosecution, the stronger the warning signal will be. Therefore, the business litigation warning model established in the study shows prediction effectiveness and can be a basis for comparison with the construction of an artificial intelligent warning model in the future. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",,

Financial risk management with normal inverse Gaussian distributions,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77950359508&partnerID=40&md5=eb6b797e34f934fc7976890de3301970,"In this study we investigate using normal inverse Gaussian distribution(NIG) in financial risk management. The first step in risk management is to find a correct model for evaluation of financial asset. Commonly asset returns are assumed to be normally distributed. However, we observed from empirical financial data that asset returns have distributions with fat tails and that they are often skew. In this paper we consider the normal inverse Gaussian distribution to model the log returns of financial data. The NIG family has the nice properties that it is flexible and the parameters can be solved closed form. These distributions allow representation of the skew distributions and tails tent to be heavier than those of the normal. The moments of NIG distributions are important in VaR calculations and derivative pricing. The financial risks associated with single securities and the portfolio investments are measured with VaR and Expected Shortfall. We estimate VaR and Expected Shortfall for the fitted Gaussian distribution and normal inverse Gaussian distribution. Then results that obtained both of them are compared. We show that the NIG model provides a potentially flexible framework to model the marginal distribution of asset returns. Finally we use the simulated data to show the performance of model. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Asset returns; Expected shortfall; Normal inverse gaussian distribution; Simulations; VaR,

We investigate that wage distribution is sensitive to the choice of quantile for both public and private sector. We find that there is no considerable wage differences between male and female employees working in the same position in the public sector. Our study provides some evidences for the fact that returns to experience are higher for men than women in both public and private sector and also returns to education are higher for private sector than public sector and also that returns to education are higher for women than those for men.

The main objective of the current paper is to test this hypothesis with respect to interbank interest rates in Hong Kong at the short end of the term structure. The study uses two approaches. The first approach is based on the implications of the EH that short and longer term rates will be cointegrated and that term spreads as well as short term changes in longer term rates will be stationary. The results of these tests are mostly supportive of the EH. The second approach uses regression analysis to directly test the predictive power of the term spread with respect to future changes in interest rates. The results are weakly supportive of the stronger version of the EH that postulates a constant risk premium, and more favorable to the weaker version of the EH that allows for a time-varying risk premium. Considering that many previous studies have rejected the EH in the context of US interest rates, and one prior study of Hong Kong interbank rates found little predictive power in the term structure, the results are interesting and suggest increased efficiency of the Hong Kong interbank market and/or possibly a more hands-off approach to interest rates by Hong Kong monetary authorities. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Expectations hypothesis; Hong kong; Term structure of interest rates,

Against this background, this study sets out to investigate the relationship between Public Sector Financial Management (PSFM) and economic development with special reference to Nigeria and Ghana. The OLS procedure against annual data from 1980 through 2006 for the countries was employed to evaluate the general impact on the economies while the log-log model was employed to examine the incremental growth of the economies. Use is also made of the Gini index theory as a measure of the degree of inequality of income distribution. The global statistics indicate overall high explanatory powers of the model. The relative statistical results indicate a highly significant causality between (PSFM) and persistent economic underdevelopment. Management of inflation, government revenue, government expenditure and investment appear to have the greatest negative effects on the efforts of these governments especially that of Nigeria. It was suggested that sub-Saharan African economies should pay particular attention to the management of these variables to reverse the trend. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",,

A risk index, known as Z score, for Global Trust Bank that became insolvent in 2004 suggests that the framework developed by Hannan and Hanweck (1988) is also relevant in the Indian context. For a random sample of 15 Indian Banks (public & private sector), we determine the riskiness/probability of book value insolvency over the years and also carry out a relative comparison between public and private sector banks in India. Results obtained in the study show that the probability of book value insolvency of Indian Banks has reduced over years and the probability of book value insolvency is lower in case of public sector banks in comparison to private sector banks. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",,

Two different measures of financial deepening namely the ratio of money supply to Gross Domestic Product (FD1) and the ratio of Domestic Credits to GDP (FD2) were used, leading to the building of two GARCH models. Our results show that in both models, a high degree of financial deepening reduces significantly the level of risk (volatility) in the stock market and that conditional volatilityof returns is fairly persistent. Employing a diagnostic test, we verified whether the GARCH model is mispecified and found that apart from recording improvement in the descriptive statistics, all the estimation pass the Ljung-Box Q12 and Q212 to check the autocorrelation and hetroscedasticity in the normalized residual of the model.

In the Republic of South Africa, it is estimated that 91% of the formal business entities are SMEs. They also contribute between 52 to 57% to GDP and provide about 61% to employment. Notwithstanding the recognition of the important roles SMEs play in these countries, their development is largely constrained by a number of factors, such as lack of access to appropriate technology; limited access to international markets, the existence of laws, regulations and rules that impede the development of the sector; weak institutional capacity, lack of management skills and training, and most importantly finance.

When we discuss the firm size, it finds that firms having 100-499 employees had the largest legislation impact for over-restrictions hours and high working-hour labor ratio, because the Council of Labor Affair (CLA) did not inspect those firm employees' number less than 100, whereas large-sized firms had less LSL impact because they already enjoyed better wages and working conditions. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Firm size; Hour restrictions; Working hours,

Total quality marketing and impression management for effctive insurance marketing,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77950346523&partnerID=40&md5=5bfe3d1820edf27084fd6e7e0224126e,"The purpose of this paper is to examine the theory of Total Quality Marketing as it applies to the Insurance Industry and to examine the meaning and general dimensions of Impression Management. The paper adopted a descriptive approach in describing the application of the conceptual formulations of Total Quality Management and Impression Management in the effective marketing of Insurance products, and also described the ways of handling clients and customers in the Insurance Industry. The paper finds that a human being apart from physiological and other physical aspects, is constituted by a bundle of impressions, and as such all we perceive of any person is the impression that the person makes on our senses. It also finds the consolidation of the Nigerian Insurance industry which is intended to herald the emergence of solid and professional institutions that can play their role effectively both in the local and international market implies that traditional marketing practices in the industry are no longer viable with the emergence of contemporary marketing philosophies. The bane on traditional marketing was its failure to place high premium on customer needs and quality as competitive tools as well as its inability to view marketing as an integrated function. These misconceptions have been addressed by TQIM that aims to establish long-term relationships with customers by creating value to satisfy customer needs first time and every time. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Impression; Insurance; Management; Marketing; Total quality,

Earnings management is measured by discretionary accruals. The three types of ownership studied are insiders, institutions and block-holders. Using the Generalized Method of Moment (GMM), the results indicate that insiders' ownership is significant and positively affect earnings management. This result is consistent with the entrenchment hypothesis which states that insiders' ownership can become ineffective in aligning insiders to take value-maximizing decisions. Further analysis shows insignificant role for institutions and block-holders in monitoring managerial behaviour earnings management. Our findings have important policy implications since they support encouraging applying corporate governance principles in order to motivate institutions and block-holders to provide effective monitoring of managers in Jordanian firms.

Variations in the prices of agricultural and non-agricultural commodities are induced, over time, by demand-supply dynamics. The last two decades have witnessed many-fold increase in the volume of international trade and business due to the wave of globalization and liberalization sweeping across the world. This has led to rapid and unpredictable variations in financial assets prices, interest rates and exchange rates, and subsequently, to exposing the corporate world to an unwieldy financial risk. In the present highly uncertain business scenario, the importance of risk management is much greater than ever before. The emergence of derivatives market is an ingenious feat of financial engineering that provides an effective and less costly solution to the problem of risk that is embedded in the price unpredictability of the underlying asset. In India, the emergence and growth of derivatives market is relatively a recent phenomenon. Since its inception in June 2000, derivatives market has exhibited exponential growth both in terms of volume and number of traded contracts. The market turn-over has grown from Rs.2365 crore in 2000-2001 to Rs. 11010482.20 crore in 2008-2009.

The empirical results showed that monetary variable does not play an overwhelming role in determining Pakistan's balance of payments. The three significant relationships were found in between Gross Domestic Product Growth Rate (GDPG) and net foreign assets (NFA), which reflected a strong positive relationship, and between Domestic Credit (DOM_CREDIT) extension and net foreign assets, which reflected a strongly negative relationship, also between interest rate (INTEREST) and net foreign assets (NFA), which also reflected a strongly negative relationship as posited by the monetary approach to balance of payments. The results evidently showed that, although some variables suggested by the monetary approach play significant roles, the balance of payments is not a purely monetary phenomenon.

To this end, an asymmetric GARCH-type model whose residuals are assumed to be t-distributed is employed to estimate exchange rate exposure.

Evidence, from the estimated logit model indicated that farm size of the farmers, previous year's income, enterprises type, household net worth and level of household agricultural commercialization are significant but negative factors influencing the banks decision to ration credit. Higher values of these factors decrease the probability that the borrowers will be credited rationed. The number of dependents in the household has a positive significant impact on the probability of being credit constrained by the banks. Hence higher values of this variable increase the likelihood of being credit rationed. The results also indicate that the larger the magnitude of the coefficient estimated, the bigger is Its impacts on the odds of being credit-ration per unit change in its variable.

Second, greater comparability is considered to result from having one set of global accounting standards. However, as one of many costs that could do so, auditor charged fees could increase because of the move to IFRS.

Impact of automated trading in the crude palm oil futures market on its underlying spot market,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-76549104281&partnerID=40&md5=a27da3bbda08f44f85ddba8982d9b5e3,"This study investigates the effects of the Malaysian futures - cash market relationship after the migration of Malaysian crude palm oil futures (FCPO) to automated system in December 2001 by employing EGARCH-t (p, q)model specifications. Specifically, it examines whether the introduction of the automated trading system has increased or decreased the volatility level of its underlying cash market and whether the asymmetric response of volatility differs between these two markets. In addition, it compares whether volatility level and volatility persistence before and after the introduction of the automated trading system differs in FCPO market. The study covers the period from January, 2000 until December 2006. Findings reveal that the volatility persistence is marginally higher under the automated trading system relative to the open outcry system for the FCPO market; asymmetric volatility parameters for the spot market are insignificant for both pre-and post-auto periods.

Unlike earlier studies we use direct and individual test procedures for both assessments. We find very little evidence of market timing ability. However, employing the theory of storage as structural model and using a volatility measure as proxy for convenience yield, we observe consistent risk premium earnings across nearly all markets.

The results of this study indicate the existence of a stable long-run equilibrium relationship between the long-and short-term interest rates, which supports the expectations hypothesis in the market. The result also indicates that the Malaysian monetary authority can effectively targets the short-term interest rates to monitor the long-term rate and macroeconomic fundamentals. The causality test result, on the other hand, shows that there is a bi-directional causality running between the term spread and the short-term interest rate.

We use Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and the Structural Equation Model (SEM) to analyze the casual relationships between service quality, customer trust, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty. This paper also examined the mediator effects of customer satisfaction and trust. The findings discovered that although the service quality and the customer satisfaction did not have a direct effect on ""customer loyalty"", they did have an indirect influence on ""customer loyalty"" via ""the trust relations"" and ""the customer degree of satisfaction"". This confirmed the mediator effects of ""trust relations"" and ""customer satisfaction"". Therefore, this research suggests that the financial consultants should understand what the demands of customers are and which factors the customer care about most after the ""Financial Tsunami"", and furthermore, to design and suggest suitable financial commodities to maintain a good image of an enterprise. Thus, the customer will develop deeper and more permanent trust, and maintain a lasting business relationship. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Customer loyalty; Customer satisfaction; Financial tsunami; Service quality; Trust,
The pricing model of discrete barrier options,2010,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-73649148086&partnerID=40&md5=b2ab61950d90dc444310d16c94d6e2bb,"Barrier options are financial derivative contracts that are activated or extinguished when the price of the underlying asset crosses a certain level. Most models for pricing barrier options assume continuous monitoring of the barrier. However in practice most, if not all, barrier options traded in markets are discretely monitored. There are two problems when we discuss the discrete barrier option. First, when the barrier is discretely monitored, a numerical method may be used to value the option. However this method will increase calculation time exponentially with the numbers of barrier. Second, for discrete barrier option problems, the trinomial model is useful, but it is less effective when the barrier is very close to current asset price. In order to resolve these two problems, we propose an analytical methodology that satisfies the partial differential equation and initial condition that characterize the discrete barrier option problem. This method increases the calculation time linearly with the numbers of barrier. Moreover, the method is effective no matter what the asset price is. Furthermore, we also discuss the effect upon the choices of the numbers of partition and the integral interval. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.",Boundary integral method; Discrete barrier options; Heat equation,

Browing (2004) finds that the impact of oil prices produces an increase in the ten-year Treasury note yield, which is similar to the finding of Fuervringer (2004). Browing (2005) reveals that the Dow Jones Industrial Average index has the highest level in almost two months, partly as a result of falling oil prices and declines in bond yields. Most studies in the literature focus on the relationships of oil prices and macroeconomic systems, or oil prices and stock indices. Few in the literature take a look at oil prices and bond prices via interest rates. Thus, the above relationships should be further investigated, since whether oil price changes affect bond investment decisions and monetary policy by way of interest rates are still major concerns for investors and government. Moreover, the massage transmission is also an essential matter in this paper, which then leads to the lag-length chosen as another topic herein. Thus, we apply six laglength chosen criteria (AIC, SBC, BIC, S, HJC, and FPE) to study in either symmetric models or asymmetric models.

After controlling for size, both small and large stocks have significantly support the overreaction hypothesis even after adjustment for difference in risk. No evidence of January effect is reported during the period; however, there is evidence of Chinese New Year effect documented in the findings. The study also shows that Malaysian Stock Market overreacts prior to 1997 Asian Financial crisis. During the post crisis, the results are not consistent with overreaction hypothesis. One possible reason to this behaviour is that investors are more aware of the phenomenon and have altered their trading strategy. As a result, overreaction behaviour diminishes and stock market gradually becomes efficient in the post crisis. These findings suggest that stock overreaction behaviour in Malaysian stock market only benefited the short-term investors.

Our findings present a challenge to the popular behavioral models. © Euro Journals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Industry Portfolio Returns; Reversals; Weekly Momentum,

These measures included the introduction of the International Accounting Standards, in 1992, followed in 1996, by the Egyptanization/translation of these standards to create the Egyptian Accounting Standards (EAS). This research aims to answer two important questions. First, what is the degree of compliance of listed Egyptian companies with the disclosure requirements of EAS? Second, what are the significant corporate characteristics that affect the levels of compliance with the required disclosure? The study is based on the manual examination of the disclosures of financial statements of the most actively traded 41 companies listed on the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchange (CASE), using a disclosure checklist issued by the Egyptian Capital Market Authority (CMA). A quantitative analysis is then used to test the relationship between corporate characteristics and disclosure level. The findings of this research indicate that the degree of disclosure by Egyptian companies is affected by the highly secretive Egyptian culture. The results further indicate that the degree of affiliation of the auditor with an international firm is the most significant variable affecting the level of disclosure by Egyptian companies. Results are then compared to their counterparts in previous studies. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Disclosure; Egypt; Egyptian accounting standards; International accounting standards,
Anomalies in CAPM: A panel data analysis under indian conditions,2009,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70350584489&partnerID=40&md5=0db91da0c5098c44996218823eddb1c7,"Despite more than a decade of reforms, Indian stock markets have not been able to mobilize and allocate capital effectively. While Indian corporate sector depends predominantly on debt to raise finance, the Indian household depends primarily on banks to invest its savings. A possible explanation for such a phenomenon can be inaccurate pricing of assets in the stock market. One of the widely used asset-pricing models is the CAPM. The present paper tries to analyse the relevance of factors other than beta that affect asset returns in the Indian stock markets. We improve upon the methodology of Fama and MacBeth (FM) cross-sectional regression, generally followed in CAPM anomalies literature. One reason why the FM method is widely applied is because it allows for time variation in estimated coefficients. However, due to the averaging of coefficients across time, the FM method will accept the null hypothesis of no relation between beta and stock returns even when the underlying model is true. To overcome this limitation we use LSDV technique. The LSDV method, while incorporating time variation also helps us overcome the limitation of averaging of coefficients. In conformity with prior literature, our results also indicate presence of size and value effect.",Anomalies in CAPM; Fama and MacBeth Cross-Sectional Regression; Least Squares Dummy Variables Estimation; Panel Data,

This study uses life insurance expenditure data of Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (SFIE) in Taiwan to estimate the Arrow-Pratt risk aversion coefficient of households empirically by using the reduced form equation derived by Halek and Eisenhauer (2001). The another aim of this paper is to provide empirical evidence on the nature of the relationship between the risk aversion and background risk which is not under the control of the agent, and that is independent of endogenous risks. Using the coefficient variation of household income as the proxy for background risk, after controlling other factors including household income and wealth, the characteristics of the head of the household and other demographic variables, the author finds that households which are more likely to face income risk exhibit a higher coefficient of risk aversion. This result is consistent with theories of optimal risk taking behavior in the presence of background risk. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Absolute risk aversion; Background risk; Relative risk aversion,

Overall, we find no size effect in all the markets and a significant market-to-book effect in all the groups. When the test allow for both variables, the negative relationship between size and average return is less significant; the inclusion of market-to-book equity seems to absorb the role of size in selected Indian stock returns. Although small firm's have to a certain extent higher average return than large firms in selected Indian markets, the market-to-book variables seems to have a consistently stronger role in average returns. Thus, the higher average return on value stocks of the studied companies in Indian industries can be considered as a local manifestation of other industries in India. © Euro Journals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Cross-section of expected stock returns; Firm size; Indian emerging markets; Market-to-book equity,

This paper uses savings on net worth value ratio, net worth on loan ratio, net profit margins, current ratio and loan growth rate as proxy variables. Overall, the empirical finding is that the credit cooperatives of Taiwan are under the influence of capital structures. The threshold variables (net worth to loan ratio) have two threshold values, 0.16 and 0.212. When the threshold value is between 0.16 and 0.212, every unit of growth in loans increases net profit margins by 2.094 times. On the contrary, with a poor capital structure, the increase in loans reduces net profit margins. Meanwhile, as credit cooperatives play a serving role in the society, they are in the places where many financial institutions are not willing to set up locations. The empirical finding shows that the growth in loans for the credit cooperatives in northern and central Taiwan affects net profit margins, especially for those in central Taiwan.

Lévy processes in particular exponential NIG Lévy models give rise to an incomplete market, thus leading to a continuum of equivalent martingale measures that can be used for risk-neutral pricing. We need to find a suitable Q-equivalent martingale measure. Therefore we consider Esscher transform method to drive a Q-equivalent martingale measure. This approach preserves structure of probability distribution. We see that we chose one specific Q-equivalent martingale measure as a representative of all the martingale measures. The density of martingale measure includes also jumps in process. In this manner, we get the chance to model jump behaviours which one seen in stock market prices. Traditional diffusion type models are insufficient to model for price jump behaviour. We prefer NIG-Lévy models instead of diffusion type models. After defining the process that captures the asset return behaviour, under the absence of arbitrage assumption, the set of equivalent martingale measures can be constructed, so, we obtain the a set of arbitrage free prices for derivatives. We use national and international index and stock returns data to calibration NIG-Lévy models. Using with Esscher transform method, we compute equivalent martingale densities.

The results indicate that trading volume as a proxy of information arrivals slightly reduces the persistence of the conditional variance and has a negative impact on volatility, challenging the presence of ""Mixed Distribution Hypothesis"" in Turkish Derivatives Exchange. However, our findings are strongly consistent with the ""Sequential Information Arrival Hypothesis"" where trading volume and return volatility follow a lead-lag pattern.

Using Taiwanese data from the years 1996 to 2006, we suggest that (1) firm performance is positively associated with RP transactions, (2) firm performance is negatively associated with RP transactions which result in expropriation of firm's minority shareholders and (3) ratio of cash-flow to control rights of the controlling shareholders, board structure and institutional ownership can minimize the negative impact of those RP transactions.

The sample of stocks is divided into quintile portfolios based on four individual valuation ratios (i.e., E/P, EBITDA/EV, B/P, and S/P) and three hybrids of them. The performance of quintile portfolios is evaluated based on several performance metrics that take account of different dimensions of portfolio risk (i.e., the Sharpe ratio, the Sortino ratio, the Jensen alpha, and 2-factor alpha). All the performance tests employed give strong evidence of the value premium that can not be explained by size effect. During the sample period value portfolios significantly outperform both the market portfolio and comparable glamour portfolios. The results show further that the risk-adjusted performance of value portfolios can be somewhat enhanced by basing portfolio selection criteria on such composite measures that employs EBITDA/EV as earnings multiple. The division of the full sample period into bull and bear market periods reveals that out performance of value strategies is attributed for the most part to their superior performance during bear market conditions. Moreover, abnormal returns of value portfolios based on composite measures are least sensitive to changing stock market sentiment. © Euro Journals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Composite Value Measures; Portfolio Performance Measurement; Valuation multiples; Value premium; Value strategies,

When they are involved in the process, firms select busy directors who are less likely to monitor aggressively, so their involvement affects the nature of directors elected to the board. Despite this evidence, prior research has not identified which CEOs are most likely to be involved CEOs. This paper addresses the issue of whether specific CEO profiles correlate with greater probability of a board whose outside directors are busy. By using logistic regression to correlate a set of full or robust CEO profiles with busy directors, this paper finds that longer-tenured CEOs may increase the probability of a board with busy directors, especially if the CEOs have been in position for a very long time and for whom good substitutes are unavailable. Another result is that firm size and busy directors are significantly correlated such that larger firms with larger scopes of operations and more complex lines of business are more likely to bring in outside directors through interlocking directorates to provide management with access to a variety of key resources. Finally, this paper concludes with some thoughts on exploring the effect of a CEO's power on board dynamics. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Busy director; CEO profile; Director selection; Involvement,

Prior research using monthly data indicates that the portion of variability in stock returns that is explained by temperature can be explained equally well by any seasonal variable. Using daily stock market index and temperature data from 42 countries the effect of temperature on both the mean and variance of stock returns is analyzed through the use of GARCH modeling. The results show that a significant portion of the temperature effect is due to seasonal component of raw temperature. Furthermore, deseasonalized temperature has a moderate impact not only on the mean but also on the conditional variance of stock index returns. The results also indicate that the Halloween indicator, which is a seasonal dummy variable, has much less explanatory power using daily rather than monthly data.

This study uses data from the returns series of the Composite Index and selected individual companies before regulation changes from 1991 to 1995 and after regulation changes from 1996 to 2004.

The findings indicate that in general and with exceptions the null hypothesis of independent and identically distributed (iid) error term is not rejected and insignificant at the 5% level on the Composite Index and individual companies before and after regulation changes and more prominent after the imposition of the new information regime. The results suggest that it is difficult to reject the random walk hypotheses for most of the return series after the regulatory reform.

Furthermore, we also find that the first order autocorrelation of both foreign exchange and stock market returns in Taiwan is negatively related to the level of conditional volatility and covariance.This time-varying nature of the serial correlation pattern is consistent with our model where some traders follow feedback strategies.

Furthermore, the differences between discrete- and continuous-time methods are compared with a statistics, mobility estimator. Substantial differences between the credit risks of the two methods were found. The continuous-time Markov chain model can hood up nicely with ratingbased term structure modeling. The empirical results indicate that the discrete-time Markov chain model may underestimate default probabilities when the dynamic rating process is not taken into consideration. Consequently, the conclusion is made that care has to be taken when discrete- and continuous-time Markov chain models are employed for dynamic credit risk management. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Bank loans; Continuous-time Markov chain model; Credit risk; Discrete-time Markov chain model,

For the analysis we use dividend model of Lintner (1956) and its extended versions in dynamic setting. The results consistently support that Pakistani listed non-financial firms rely on both current earning per share and past dividend per share to set their dividend payments. However, the dividend tends to be more sensitive to current earnings than prior dividends. The listed non-financial firms having the high speed of adjustment and low target payout ratio show the instability in smoothing their dividend payments. To find out the determinants of dividend payout policy dynamic panel regression has been performed. It is found that the profitable firms with more stable net earnings can afford larger free cash flows and therefore pay larger dividends. Furthermore the ownership concentration and market liquidity have the positive impact on dividend payout policy. Besides, the investment opportunities and leverage have the negative impact on dividend payout policy. The market capitalization and size of the firms have the negative impact on dividend payout policy which shows that the firms prefer to invest in their assets rather than pay dividends to their shareholders. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Dividend dynamics; Dividend policy; Dynamics panel data; Partial adjustment model; Target payout,

However, the risks are somewhat different because of the size, geographic concentration, liquidity needs and extension of credit only to its members. Geographic concentration limits the need for evaluation relative to the financial strengths and ability to assess and adequately monitor the risks of the investments. A small size credit union may manage risks by investing all of the surplus funds in a corporate credit union instead of investing in securities. However, the growth of credit union's assets and liabilities poses challenges for management in understanding risks and returns. Credit union management often uses a laddered portfolio as a tool to manage liquidity and interest rate risk. In this approach, investment maturities are laddered to provide necessary cash flows. This paper presents how fuzzy goal programming techniques can be efficiently applied in developing sophisticated investment decision making models to provide feasible solutions for credit union portfolio management problems for constructing efficient portfolios. We have formulated additive and weighted additive models for investment decisions using fuzzy goal programming. The results are tested based on scenario analysis for the data selected for the study. Additionally, comparison of the results from both models related to achievements of targeted goals and preferences is also presented. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Credit union; Fuzzy goal programming; Portfolio management,

Our findings suggest that in the long-run, domestic demand and GDP are neutral to fluctuations in property prices. The reason is that while property booms drive higher gross investments, this is always accompanied by an offsetting decline in private consumption. In the short-run however, the neutrality of demand and GDP to property price fluctuations is less certain. It is conceivable that property booms can reinforce real economic booms since property prices do seem to exert temporary pro-cyclical effects on both consumption and investment. These findings imply that stimulating property market activities is not an effective way to drive sustained growth in the real economy. Nonetheless, there may be room to consider the property market as a policy tool for short-term macroeconomic management. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Cointegration; Investment channel; Property market developments; Wealth effect,

Finally, I use an ordered probit model to estimate the relationship between more than a hundred local and regional government ratings and a set of economic and financial variables.

For a given fund, we use the SSD criteria to identify an equivalent fund with normal return distribution. The Sharpe ratio of the equivalent fund is referred to as the generalized Sharpe ratio (GSR). The generalized Sharpe ratio not only provides a complete rank of funds but also is consistent with investors' risk aversion. We show that the generalized Sharpe ratio has an intuitively appealing link to various moments of the fund return distribution. In addition, we extend the generalized Sharpe ratio to the left tails of fund return distribution to measure the downside risk of a fund. Applying to a sample of mutual funds, our results show that the ranking based on the new measure can be substantially different from that based on the conventional Sharpe ratio, with our measure directly tying to the distributional features of fund returns. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Portfolio performance; Sharpe ratio; Stochastic dominance,

Spot and futures markets of selected commercial banks in India: What causes what?,2009,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70349234329&partnerID=40&md5=b3579078ef52df60d433ccc48d301480,"Johansen's Cointegration technique followed by the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) was employed to examine the lead-lag relationship between NSE spot and futures market for selected twenty-one commercial banking stocks of India. The empirical analysis was conducted for the daily data series from 27th May, 2005 to 29th May, 2008 and it is collected from National Stock Exchange (NSE) website. The analysis reveals mixed findings. However, most of the selected commercial bank stocks in India reveal future leads to spot and equal number of selected banking stocks reveals bi-directional and spot lead to future prices. The variation of price discovery mechanism from one bank stock to another is due to the fact that the selected commercial banking stocks are widely dispersed in terms of its bank-specific activities and also they are subject towards prevailing differential market frictions such as transaction costs, initial margin requirements, leverage positions and flexibility of short positions and liquidity differences between spot and futures markets. Besides, the present study suggests that depending on the relative proportion of informed to uninformed (noise) traders migrating from the spot market to the futures market, the lead-lag relationship between futures and spot market of selected banking stocks may differs. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Cointegration; Futures market; Informational efficiency; Lead-lag relationship; Vector error correction model,

Determinants of capital structure for turkish firms: A panel data analysis,2009,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67650796833&partnerID=40&md5=aab1e03196b29e98aaeb740bf5a1c2d5,"The capital structure of a company consists of a particular combination of debt and equity issues to relieve potential pressures on its long-term financing. To examine such issues, many theories have been developed in the literature and they generally focus upon what determinants are likely to influence the so-called leverage decisions of the firms. Among these, the MM theory, trade-off theory and signalling theory have been said to mainly play a crucial role in identifying and testing the various properties of the leverage decisions. This paper briefly tries to define the fundamentals underlying these theories and evaluates whether some a priori assumed macroeconomic determinants can be related to the leverage parameters of interest examined in the paper. For this purpose, we conduct an empirical research that covers 42 selected firms traded at the Istanbul Stock Exchange ISE- 100 index. Following the developments in the contemporaneous estimation techniques that allow us to use time series and cross section data concurrently, the panel data methodology has been applied to the actual data to compute the leverage ratios for each firm within the time period 2000-2007. From this, it is hoped that we are able to highlight the issue of what properties the leverage ratios have and to satisfy our curiosity about how can the macroeconomic determinants affect the leverage ratios under various groupings such as tangibility, size, growth opportunities, profitability and nondebt tax shields. Our main results reveal that return on assets and tangibility of assets have a positive and statistically significant impact on the firm's leverage ratio, while the ratio of total depreciation to total assets and profit margin on sales seem to have some negative and significant impacts on firms' leverage degree. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Capital structure theory; Leverage; Macroeconomic determinants,

Results showed that liquidity and size entailed a negative impact on leverage. While tangibility of assets triggered a positive effect on leverage, profitability, non-debt tax shield and growth were found to be impotent. Interestingly, investment was found to be positively related to the use of leases but negatively related to loans, symptomatic to crowding out of loans by leases. Age of the company was also found to affect some of the various components of leverage.

Models ESTR and LSTR are utilized to investigate the impacts of noise trader risk and short selling restriction respectively. We find that there are indeed limited arbitrages in Taiwanese financial markets and the noise trader risk plays a dominant role.

The information asymmetry problems between employees and shareholders thus may occur. This in turn increases innovation risks resulting in impaired firm performance. To mitigate the agency problems and consequently reduce innovation risks, firms need to institute an appropriate incentive mechanism. By awarding stock ownership, employee stock bonus may serve as an interestalignment device to reduce innovation uncertainties by attracting, retaining and motivating high-quality technical individuals. Using a panel sample of 32 listed IT firms on the Taiwan Stock Exchange during 1995-2004, the empirical results indicate that employee stock bonus has a positive impact on firm performance. Additionally, the stock bonus-firm performance relationship is stronger in R&D-intensive firms and in asset-intensive firms. These findings are consistent with the argument that employee stock bonus can help mitigate agency problems and consequently reduce innovation risks, leading to enhanced firm performance as an end result. Finally, it is also evident that firm performance increases with stock bonus paying, but the ratio of stock bonus to total salary does not increase with firm performance. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Assets in place; Employee stock bonus; Firm performance; R&D investments,

A profit maximising net settlement system competes with a welfare maximising central bank gross payment system. The two payment systems are imperfect substitutes. The central bank system charges fees that exceed the marginal cost, enhancing the use of the underutilised private system. The central bank system is also a service provider to the private system because the private system needs central bank money for settlement purposes. In some cases the central bank system should make the use of central bank money for set-tlement purposes expensive in order to induce the private system to charge low fees. This is a para-dox because the central bank can lower the marginal cost of the private system by increasing the av-erage cost. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Mixed oligopolies; Network Economics; Payment systems,

This means that no possibility exists of making sustainable excess returns and the prices follow a random walk. An efficient and integrated capital market is an important infrastructure that facilitates capital formation. The efficiency with which the capital formation is carried out depends on the efficiency of the capital markets and financial institutions. A capital market is said to be efficient with respect to corporate event announcement (stock split, buyback, right issue, bonus announcement, merger & acquisition, dividend etc) contained information's and its disseminations. How quickly and correctly the security prices reflect these event contained information's show the efficiency of stock markets.

Corporate yield spread and transparency spread: An empirical examination,2009,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67549118754&partnerID=40&md5=1a03106ee940ebfb50067c5f67cc0674,"This paper contributes to the extant literature by empirically identifying and analyzing a heretofore ignored component of the default spread due to the imperfect observation of firm value. The purpose of our study is to examine the effects of information quality on corporate credit spreads. Also, I intend to analyse how the information quality behave with the inclusion of credit rating. To isolate the effects of accounting transparency, I control for the fundamental determinants of credit risk. The factors which I use as explanatory variables can be divided into three categories: market variables, issue and issuer characteristics. To some extent, these three categories correspond to the different types of risk, namely interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. Our findings suggest that actual corporate yield spreads may incorporate an information premium that is ignored by traditional corporate bond pricing models. Consistent with theoretical predictions, I find a positive relation between measure of information precision and credit spreads. Also, I show that only for investment grade bonds, credit rating is indeed correlated with the disclosure quality of the issuer. In others words, credit rating contains information regarding perceived accounting transparency. The time-series regression results provide strong empirical support for credit risk models based on information. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Credit spread; Rating; Research and development activity; Transparency spread,

Monetary stability and performance in the commercial banking industry of emerging markets,2009,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67549118753&partnerID=40&md5=d910e47e0b69648bcf3a1c645aad6617,"Many economists have described the positive link between monetary stability and efficiency. However, results of empirical tests indicate that the relationship of inflation, productivity, and monetary policy remains unresolved. One major limitation of most previous studies is that they lump together all independent variables in regressions that focus on the determination of gdp levels or growth rates. Variables such as physical capital, labor, and other financial resources are production inputs, but other conditions such as market structure or macroeconomic management of the economy facilitate production, not inputs. Hence, this study adds to the existing literature and circumvents the limitations of previous empirical tests by estimating a production function that represents optimal output levels, given input use, and measuring economic performance using the productive efficiency of reaching optimal output levels. The current study employs the most recent advancements in efficiency estimation. Accordingly, technical, scale, and overall economic efficiencies are derived from frontier functions utilizing the general composite indirect profit function. The empirical results of this paper suggest that monetary stability allows management of commercial banks to allocate resources more efficiently. © eurojournals publishing, inc. 2009.",,

The stock prices of quoted companies in Nigeria are affected either positivity or negatively by a number of factors occurring within or without the economic system. The paper examines the impact of Real Gross Domestic Product (RGDP), Interest Rate (INT) and Inflation Rate (INF) on stock prices of quoted companies in Nigeria from 1997 - 2006. Stock prices were represented by Stock Market Value Index in the model, which is SMVI = α0 + α1 INT + α2 INF + α3 RGDP + u. A regression analysis showed that the explanatory variables accounted for 95.6% of the variation in stock prices. While a reduction in interest and inflation rate resulted in increased stock prices, increased RDGP has a positive impact.

It is also one of the very first examples which try to identify the potential dynamics and determinants of dividend payout in Pakistan by using the well established dividend models in context of emerging market. For dynamic equation we used the extended model of Lintner, Fama and Babiak and 'Proposed' model in dynamic setting. The results consistently support that Pakistani listed non-financial firms rely on both the change in dividends and change in net earnings which clearly demonstrate that the firms rely on both current earning per share and past dividend per share to set their dividend payments. However the study clearly shows that dividend tends to be more sensitive to current earnings than prior dividends. The listed non financial firms having the high speed of adjustment and low target payout ratio show the instability to smoothing their dividend payments. To find out the determinants of dividend payout policy dynamic panel regression has been performed. Firstly, profitable firms with more stable net earnings can afford larger free cash flows and therefore pay larger dividends. Furthermore the ownership concentration and market liquidity have the positive impact on dividend payout policy. Besides, the slack and leverage have the negative impact on dividend payout policy. The market capitalization and size of the firms have the negative impact on dividend payout policy which clearly shows that the firms prefer to invest in their assets rather than pay dividends to its shareholders. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Dividend dynamics; Dividend policy; Dynamics panel data; Partial adjustment model; Target payout,

However, Camara's (2001) models do not consider some popular contract conditions in ESO, such as reset and reload. Besides, a constant interest rate is assumed in his models; this might be inappropriate, since for ESO, the time to maturity is usually over five years. In this study, we compare different kinds of ESO and reset or reload properties with stochastic interest rates. We find that there exists a trade-off between APIs and RPIs options.

To test this theory, we use quarterly and yearly data for the interest rates, inflation rate differentials, and changes in exchange rates over a five-year period, 2003-2008. We chosen for our study four foreign countries, namely, the USA, Japan, Singapore, and the UK, based on their levels of economic development and industrialization, and Indonesia as the home country. Regression results show that interest rate differentials have positive but no significant influence on changes in exchange rate for the USA, Singapore, and the UK relative to that of Indonesian. On the other hand, interest rate differentials have negative significant influence on changes in exchange rates for Japan. Regression results also show that, overall, inflation rate differentials have positive significant influence on interest rate differential. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",And Inflation Rates; Exchange Rates; Interest Rates; International Fisher Effect Theory,

The so called ""flattening Phillips curve"" becomes the global phenomenon. If this phenomenon, the flattening Phillips curve, is dominant in the world, how does this phenomenon affect the monetary policy? This is our motivation. In this paper, we use the typical backward looking New Keynesian model based on Orphanides(2003), and derive the optimal monetary policy rule (Taylor rule). Then, we study the effect of the sensitivity of inflation to business cycles (output gap) on this Taylor rule. We get the result that the decreasing sensitivity of inflation to the business cycles (the flattening Phillips curve) supports the aggressive behavior of monetary authority despite the degree of how the nation respects the inflation. If globalization is the main cause of the flattening Phillips curve as IMF pointed out, our conclusion suggests that the globalization should in uce the aggressive monetary policy in the world.",Business cycle; Monetary policy; Phillips curve; Taylor rule; Welfare,

The application of the EGB2 model reveals the existence of a clear and significant relationship between sentiment and volatility, particularly in the MSCI, TE and TF futures markets. We find that all sentiment variables have limited forecasting power, and that negative return shocks will ultimately lead to an increase in future volatility. We go on to determine whether lagged returns cause volatility, importing the SWARCH model of Hamilton (1994) to analyze the volatility regimes of investor sentiment, and find that the majority of investors will maintain the same regime in the next period. Our study suggests that the EGB2 model is effective in volatility forecasting, and that the SWARCH model is a useful method of discriminating between the volatility arising from investor sentiment in the futures market. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",EGB2; G14; JEL Classification Codes: G10; Sentiment index; SWARCH; Volatility,

Focusing on the specific relationship between the market and each agency, I obtain the following results. First, an unbalanced panel data estimation demonstrates that, beyond the obvious negative relationship between spreads and ratings, Moody's disagrees with the market more often than Fitch and S&P's. Second, although Moody's ratings adjust less often to stick to markets spreads than S&P's and Fitch, the ratings of the three agencies are particularly stable. Third, there is an asymmetric adjustment of ratings: the three agencies are more prone to downgrade following excessively high spreads and spread increases than to upgrade following excessively low spreads and spread decreases. Fourth, reactions of spreads to rating changes reveal that S&P's downgrades and Moody's upgrades have the most significant impact on spread movements. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.","JP Morgan EMBI Global spreads, unbalanced panel; Sovereign ratings",

The Granger causality test was employed to examine possible spillover channels of the stock returns and stock return volatility in the selected markets. This study also analyzed the innovation impulse and response relationships between stock returns and stock return volatilities. Empirical results indicate that Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Japan played critical roles in the transmission of the crisis. In addition, before the onset of the crisis, feedback among the selected stock markets increased, but one-way spillovers decreased. After the crisis, spillover effects of the stock returns and stock return volatilities in the nine Asian stock markets were larger than those before the crisis. Finally, the impulse-response analysis indicates that the impulse-response effect of the stock returns and stock return volatilities were larger and smaller, respectively, after the crisis. From our empirical results, we find that the crisis spillover effect could be reinforced by countries with transmission roles that are trivial in the beginning, but are boosted by the onset of the crisis.

It is argued that this produces an average return on net wealth while what is needed is a marginal return on net wealth.

First, this paper derives the parameters of the two zero-coupon bonds to model a bond, or bond portfolio. Then a comparison is made of different methods to estimate the variation of a bond value, under interest rate, and time to maturity variations. The conclusion is that a single zero-coupon bond, even though it does not replicate the convexity of a vanilla bond, or a bond portfolio, is a simple and accurate model to estimate bond values under interest rate and time to maturity changes.

The empirical results show no evidence of long-run relationship between inflation and financial development for six countries and no causality for two countries. It has been found that financial development causes inflation in four countries; evidence of reverse causation has been detected for only two countries.

When the compensation ratio of the firm is higher and the earnings are lower than the industry average at the same time, the firm faces a rewarding failure problem. The result indicates that rewarding failure is harmful to firm performance. When firms have the rewarding failure problem and adopt cash flow rights leverage at the same time, they will perform worse. The simultaneous equations confirm that performance and rewarding failure are jointly endogenous. The rewarding failure issue could be inspired by a worse performance, while on the other hand firms with a rewarding failure problem tend to lower their performance.

Hence, our proposed indicator is novel in the sense that it takes two aspects of securitization into accounts; which is the amount of securitization activities as well as the different combinations of instruments that constitute banks' securitization activity. Besides, measure to prevent biases from banks' size is also taken into account.

VaR has been widely and quickly accepted as a true risk measure for the banking industry, but it is yet to find enough acceptances for the investment industry, primarily because of the fundamental difference of the later from the former from the point of view of time horizon and turnover frequency of the portfolio concerned. This does not imply however that VaR measures are not useful for investment industry and many of the reasons that made VaR successful for banking industry are also applicable for investment managers. The current study attempts to highlight the importance of VaR as a measure of 'downside risk' for Indian equity mutual funds, an aspect which is completely ignored for performance reporting in Indian mutual fund industry. The study used three parametric models and one non parametric model and weekly returns of a sample of equity mutual fund schemes in India, to predict their weekly VaR on a 'rolling' basis and also tested the robustness and predictive ability of the models by employing two popular 'back testing' approaches. Overall the analysis shows that the Indian equity mutual funds have exhibited considerable downside risk in terms of VaR measures. Back testing of the models suggest that the 'random walk' and the 'moving average' models suffer from a downward bias and err by underestimating the VaR frequently. The EWMA and historical simulation models are free from that bias, but these two models, particularly the later, show tendency of providing too conservative estimates of VaR. ©EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Equity mutual funds; EWMA; Historical simulation; Random walk; Var,

The popular measure of systematic risk is the CAPM beta. The CAPM states that the expected return on an asset depends upon its level of systematic risk. The asset's systematic risk is measured relative to that of the market portfolio. The Model has been questioned by several empirical studies focused on the impact of return interval of betas. This paper attempts to estimate the CAPM at different time scales for an emerging market. In this study, we adopt wavelets analysis, a relatively new and innovative approach in finance proposed by Gencay et al. (2002), as the key empirical method for examining the relationship between the return of the stock and its systematic risk at different time scales. The proposed procedure is acted on a sample, composed of 98 randomly selected stocks, listed on Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) actively traded over 2003-2007. It has proved that the relationship between the return of a stock and its beta is more robust at medium scale. This evidence shows that the Turkish stock market is more efficient in the 3rd scale (8-16 days). This finding, therefore, shows that the predictions of the CAPM are more relevant at the medium-horizon in a multi-scale framework as compared to the other horizons.©EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",CAPM; ISE; Scaling; Systematic (market) risk; Wavelets,

The main framework believes that FDI changes industrial concentration and decreases monopoly power of domestic firms and transforms market to perfect competition condition. Based upon this explanation, this study analyzes how the FDI effects the market concentration in the Turkish manufacturing industries between 1989 and 2006. The results of the study point out that there is no link between FDI and market structure; in other words, FDI does not shift the market structure to the perfect competition. ©EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Foreign direct investment (fdi); Market concentration and fdi,
Director networks and their similarity in r&d expenditure decision,2009,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67549098370&partnerID=40&md5=8c09270575d047c358aa705343dd68fd,"This paper explored the economic impacts of social connections on R&D decisions of firms. We asked whether members of a tight social network could impact directors' decision-making and affect the policy uniqueness of a firm. Specifically, we inquired whether firms' decisions are affected by how well-connected the firm's directors are. In order to create a proxy for directors' social connections, we employed methods from social network analysis similar to those used by Hochberg et al. (2007) and Kuhnen (2007) and constructed a measure that captures the various dimensions of connectivity, such as how well-connected the director is and the quality and predominance of each director's connections in the network. Our main result showed that firms whose directors are well connected and whose connections are with better connected directors exhibit homogeneity in their R&D policy. In addition, we also found that both the concentration magnitude of industries and the maturity of the firms moderate the relationship between director network and R&D policy similarity. The correlation in policy homogeneity tends to increase with both maturity and concentration of the industry. The results provided a new perspective of looking at firms' R&D decisions by blending corporate finance and industrial organization together. We also provided some intuitions regarding why firms tend to cluster their innovation policy together and why we observe these policies occurring in waves. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Concentration; Director network; Maturity; Policy homogeneity,

The author collected data of this study from the financial statements of the corporations listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) for the year 2007. The author utilized ANOVA and Pearson correlation analyses for empirical investigation. The major findings of the study are as follows. The lowest mean value of the CCC is found in the retail/wholesale industry, with an average of 34.58 days, and the highest mean value of the CCC is found in the textile industry, with an average of 164.89 days. There is a significant negative correlation between the CCC and the variables; the firm size and the profitability. The findings of this paper are based on a study conducted on the ISE. Hence, the results are not generaliseable to non-listed companies. Secondly, the sample comprises merchandising and manufacturing companies. Therefore, the results are valid for those industries.

The sample consists of the thirty one non financial firms included in the stock market index CASE50. The results indicate that certain financial fundamentals are quite informative, thus contribute to shareholder value significantly. Regarding the classification of financial fundamentals, the results indicate that shareholder value is significantly associated with firms' liquidity, assets efficiency, expense control and leverage. The merits of this paper are three fold. First, this paper is the first study in the Egyptian index that addresses how to support shareholder value, which is one of the fundamental targets of the investment in financial markets. Second, the paper presents a proof that the P/B ratio (being a proxy for shareholder value) takes into account the stock returns as well. This renders the P/B ratio very good proxy for the measurement of shareholder value. Third, the estimation procedure addresses the true relationship between the variables through examining the exponential relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The results indicate that the exponential relationship improves the results significantly.

Further research reveals that the expenses are negatively related to performance while the impact of turnover on performance is positive. Additionally, the expenses strongly persist short-run while performance does not. Applying a return-cost based rating of iShares we find that the highly ranked iShares present the highest return but they do not necessarily present the lowest expense ratios.

The study runs from 1986 through 2004. Being a time series data, to avoid spurious regression results, the first step was to test for stationarity of the data by using Philip-Perron Unit Root test. Then, Johansen (1988) technique was used to establish if the non-stationary variables are cointegrated. Employing Vector Error Correction Model, we found that non-oil export on the whole have performed below expectations, thereby questioning the efficacy of the export promotion strategies in Nigerian economy. The economy is still far from being diversified away from crude oil exports. For Nigeria to experience gradual transformation towards increasing reliance on traditional non-oil and manufactured export, we recommended that there should be a change in the objectives and focus of export promotion strategies from financial and other institutional assistance, to the development of regional markets, as well as ensuring that manufactured export business remains profitable. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Cointegration; Devaluation; Diversification; Export promotion; Productive Base,

The macroeconomic variables being investigated are Consumer Price Index, Industrial Production Index, money supply (M3), Interbank Money Market Transaction, three months and six months Treasury Bills Discount Rate and crude oil prices. These variables are chosen taking into account the empirical literature in order to cover a wide spread of economic processes in the Malaysian economy.

Data for the analysis were sourced from the agricultural credit transactions of the banks. Evidence from the multinomial logit model estimated shows that the borrowers are heterogeneous. Farm size, previous income, enterprise type, coop membership, household net-worth and agricultural commercialization level are positive and significantly associated with the classification of the two groups relative to the reference group. The significant variables affect both the probability of classification and the utility of the banks in their decision making. The partial elasticities of farm size are elastic at 1.5380, 1.2796, and 1.0065 for the groups as classified. The quasi elasticities for the household net-worth and agricultural commercialization variables are all elastic for all the groups. The quasi-elasticity for the income variable for the first group is elastic at 1.4278 and for the second group at 1.2551. This variable is inelastic for the reference group. It is recommended that Banks borrowing decisions must be group specific and not general. There is also the need to find an innovative way of meeting the need of the rejected group in terms of Micro finance arrangements.

Long swing in appreciation and short swing in depreciation - Could they exist in asian foreign exchange?,2009,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67549099383&partnerID=40&md5=131f881a69fb751c37f63a6fd368a3db,"This paper investigates the presence of asymmetric swings, i.e., long swings in appreciation and short swings in depreciation, using the exchange rates of Asian countries. These long and short swings reflect the asymmetric preference of the authority, i.e., a slowdown policy in a depreciation and/or a let-it-go policy in an appreciation. Four prerequisites are proposed for these asymmetric swings: a managed floating exchange rate system, an export-oriented policy, little short-term external foreign debt, and large foreign reserves. The four prerequisites reflect a country's willingness and ability to slow down the exchange rate in an appreciation regime and let-it-go in a depreciation regime. Our estimated results based on the Markov switching model are highly consistent with our conjecture. Japan and Singapore are found to meet the four requirements and their currencies display pronounced asymmetric swings. South Korea meets the requirements to a lesser extent and its currency displays weak asymmetric swings. Indonesia and Thailand do not meet the last two requirements, and their currencies display considerably weak asymmetric swings, but no symmetric swings. Interestingly, in the case of Taiwan, though it meets the four requirements, it also exhibits very weak asymmetric swings. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Asymmetric swing; Exchange rate system; Markov switching; Short-term debt,

Banks are required to hold capital in proportion to their perceived credit risks. In June 2006 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a comprehensive document on New Capital Adequacy Framework to replace the 1988 Basel Accord and to foster a strong emphasis on risk management and to encourage ongoing improvements in banks' risk assessment capabilities. The paper examines the potential impact of Basel II on the developing economies, in particular reference to Bangladesh. A pilot testing model for Basel II parallel calculations are being employed to measure the impact of capital requirements of Mercantile Bank Limited, a commercial bank in Bangladesh. The result shows that the capital requirement to comply with Basel II has been increased by 41.94% as compared to Basel I capital requirements. The capital requirement under Basel II regime increased due to additional burden of capital from Market Risk and Operational Risk. There are many possible negative impacts of an unchecked implementation of Basel II. However, Basel II is here to stay and the competitive forces will compel banks to follow the example. The option here is to decide what form of the Basel II norms should be applied and to what extent to ensure the survival and growth for the developing economies. Ultimately, the norms are for strengthening the banking systems globally and this objective should not be lost. Developing Economies need to be prepared and to adapt to the changing global conditions and to adapt the norms to their own advantage.©EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Basel i; Basel ii; Capital requirements; Developing economies; Pilot testing model; Risk weighted assets,

A note on the role of exit horizon in the selection of projects in venture capital finance,2009,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67549129098&partnerID=40&md5=6dfff74cda8dc19cc56e0fabbd713b62,"We build a model to highlight the role of preferences of the external investor over the project's exit horizon in venture capital finance. We show that if the external investor prefers short investment periods, then the set of eligible projects is restricted and the venture capitalist cuts off the riskier and hence more innovative projects. Our model provides a theoretical framework that supports the argument that low participation of pension funds in early stage highly innovative investments is attributed to the short exit horizon of pension fund managers. Furthermore, from the policy point of view, our model suggests that if state-owned funds extend their investment horizon, more innovative projects will be financed through venture capital finance. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",Exit horizon; Pension funds; Project selection; Venture capital,
Profit planning of an ngo run enterprise using linear programming approach,2009,International Research Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67549130471&partnerID=40&md5=7a9d61e668bd333ab64ac5a098ee3b4c,"The use of Operations Research (OR) especially Linear Programming (LP) is not popular even in the large scale public and private sector units. It remains to a larger extend as a subject of academic importance. But the fact is that even a tiny sector unit has much to gain from the use of the quantitative tools in the decision making process. In the globalized economy use of sophisticated tools which guide more practical decisions taking into account all possible constraints is relevant and becomes more inevitable. Linear programming in OR is certainly the most suitable and useable tool in this regard, because of its simplicity and availability in the form of software packages. While using the LP packages what is required is a fair understanding of the product mix, market for the existing products, their demand in the market and the product movement. With all these knowledge, different models can be developed and run until a suitable solution is obtained. This study demonstrates the use of OR, especially in solving linear programming technique using (Linear Interactive Discrete Optimizer) LINDO software to maximize the profit of a Khadi & Village Industries Commission (KVIC) affiliated Sarvodaya sangham run by NonGovernment Organisation (NGO). © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.",C61; Linear programming; Maximization; Non government organisation c44; Operations research; Profit planning,

Frost, it contains a new algorithm for the gradual adaptation of the color lookup table during the presentation of the movie to ensure optimal color quality on low-end workstations. Second, it is a multistandard system supporting the compression techniques MPEG, Motion JPEG, and a newly developed extension to the well-known Color Cell Compression method. Third, it contains AdFEC, a new adaptable forward error correction method for our movie transmission protocol.

On Modeling Information Retrieval with Probabilistic Inference,1995,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029214138&doi=10.1145%2f195705.195713&partnerID=40&md5=162bdec6845b8c5d3533837eff477ac3,"This article examines and extends the logical models of information retrieval in the context of probability theory. The fundamental notions of term weights and relevance are given probabilistic interpretations. A unified framework is developed for modeling the retrieval process with probabilistic inference. This new approach provides a common conceptual and mathematical basis for many retrieval models, such as the Boolean, fuzzy set, vector space, and conventional probabilistic models. Within this framework, the underlying assumptions employed by each model are identified, and the inherent relationships between these models are analyzed. Although this article is mainly a theoretical analysis of probabilistic inference for information retrieval, practical methods for estimating the required probabilities are provided by simple examples. © 1995, ACM.

A Video Retrieval and Sequencing System,1995,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029390443&doi=10.1145%2f211430.211431&partnerID=40&md5=443869990617f770e9240fb49593190e,"Video is an effective medium for capturing the events in the real world around us, and a vast amount of video materials exists, covering a wide range of applications. However, widespread use of video in computer applications is often impeded by the lack of effective tools to manage video information systematically. This article discusses the design and implementation of a frame-based video retrieval and sequencing system (VRSS). The system is designed to support the entire process of video information management: segmenting, indexing, retrieving, and sequencing of video data. A semiautomatic tool is developed to divide video sequences into meaningful shots, Each video shot is logged using text descriptions, audio dialogue, and cinematic attributes. A two-layered, concept-based model is used as the basis for accurately retrieving relevant video shots based on users' free-text queries. A cinematic, rule-based, virtual editing tool is also developed to sequence the video shots retrieved for presentation within a specified time constraint. The system has been tested on a video documentary on the NUS (National University of Singapore) engineering faculty. The results of video retrieval experiments are encouraging.

Motion Recovery for Video Content Classification,1995,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029387456&doi=10.1145%2f211430.211433&partnerID=40&md5=c2a1d07ab0aafbf741d8e58ddcfb209e,"Like other types of digital information, video sequences must be classified based on the semantics of their contents. A more-precise and completer extraction of semantic information wdl result m a more-effective classification. The most-discernible difference between still Images and moving pictures stems from movements and variations Thus, to go from the realm of still-image repositories to video databases, we must be able to deal with motion. Particularly, we need the ablhty to classify objects appearing in a video sequence based on therr characteristics and features such as shape or color, as well as their movements By describing the movements that we derive from the process of motion analysis, we introduce a dual hierarchy consisting of spatial and temporal parts for video sequence representation. This gives us the flexibility to examine arbitrary sequences of frames at various levels of abstraction and to retrieve the associated temporal information (say, object trajectories) in addition to the spatial representation. Our algorlthm for motion detection uses the motion compensation component of the MPEG video-encoding scheme and then computes trajectories for objects of interest.

Embedded Video in Hypermedia Documents: Supporting integration and Adaptive Control,1995,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029389726&doi=10.1145%2f211430.211439&partnerID=40&md5=c086336519894cbadb0a31f414d497d5,"As the availability of digital video becomes commonplace, a shift in apphcation focus will occur from merely accessing video as an mdependent data stream to embeddzng video with other multimedia data types mto coordinated hypermedia presentations. The migration to embedded video wdl present new demands on apphcation and support environments: processing of any one piece of video data will depend on how that data relates to other data streams active within the same presentation. This article describes presentation, synchronization, and interaction control issues for manipulating embedded video. First we describe the requirements for embedded video, contrasted against other forms of video use. Next we consider mechanisms for describing and Implementing the behavior of embedded-video segments relative to other data items in a document; these relationships form the basis of implementing cooperative control among the events in a presentation Finally we consider extending the possibilities for tailoring embedded video to the characteristics of the local runtlme environment; this forms the basis for adaptive, application-level quality-of-service control of a presentation. In all cases, we describe a mechanism to externalize the behavior of hypermedia presentations containing resource-intensive data requmements so that effective control can be imp] emented by low-level system facilities based on application-specific requirements.

From Text to Hypertext by Indexing,1995,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029229362&doi=10.1145%2f195705.195717&partnerID=40&md5=9c51bb86152f40517afc9da860213c8c,"A model is presented for converting a collection of documents to hypertext by means of indexing. The documents are assumed to be semistructured, i.e., their text is a hierarchy of parts, and some of the parts consist of natural language. The model is intended as a framework for specifying hypertextual reading capabilities for specific application areas and for developing new automated tools for the conversion of semistructured text to hypertext. In the model, two well-known paradigms—formal grammars and document indexing—are combined. The structure of the source text is defined by a schema that is a constrained context-free grammar. The hierarchic structure of the source may thus be modeled by a parse tree for the grammar. The effect of indexing is described by grammar transformations. The new grammar, called an indexing schema, is associated with a new parse tree where some text parts are index elements. The indexing schema may hide some parts of the original documents or the structure of some parts. For information retrieval, parts of the indexed text are considered to be nodes of a hypergraph. In the hypergraph-based information access, the navigation capabilities of the hypertext systems are combined with the querying capabilities of information retrieval systems. © 1995, ACM.

Toward a Logical/Physical Theory of Spreadsheet Modeling,1995,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029224070&doi=10.1145%2f195705.195708&partnerID=40&md5=37311fa2aa7371054c31b12837998e9b,"In spite of the increasing sophistication and power of commercial spreadsheet packages, we still lack a formal theory or a methodology to support the construction and maintenance of spreadsheet models. Using a dual logical/physical perspective, we identify four principal components that characterize any spread sheet model: schema, data, editorial, and binding. We present a factoring algorithm for identifying and extracting these components from conventional spreadsheets with minimal user intervention, and a synthesis algorithm that assists users in the construction of executable spreadsheets from reusable model components. This approach opens new possibilities for applying object-oriented and model management techniques to support the construction, sharing, and reuse of spreadsheet models in organizations. Importantly, our approach to model management and the Windows-based prototype that we have developed are designed to coexist with, rather than replace, traditional spreadsheet programs. In other words, the users are not required to learn a new modeling language; instead, their logical models and data sets are extracted from their spreadsheets transparently, as a side-effect of using standard spreadsheet programs. © 1995, ACM.

Design and Evaluation of Algorithms for Image Retrieval by Spatial Similarity,1995,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976823481&doi=10.1145%2f201040.201041&partnerID=40&md5=5d19956e4fad6f684f70b613c705efb3,"Similarity-based retrieval of images is an important task in many image database applications. A major class of users' requests requires retrieving those images in the database that are spatially similar to the query image. We propose an algorithm for computing the spatial similarity between two symbolic images. A symbolic image is a logical representation of the original image where the image objects are uniquely labeled with symbolic names. Spatial relationships in a symbolic image are represented as edges in a weighted graph referred to as spatial-orientation graph. Spatial similarity is then quantified in terms of the number of, as well as the extent to which, the edges of the spatial-orientation graph of the database image conform to the corresponding edges of the spatial-orientation graph of the query image. The proposed algorithm is robust in the sense that it can deal with translation, scale, and rotational variances in images. The algorithm has quadratic time complexity in terms of the total number of objects in both the database and query images. We also introduce the idea of quantifying a system's retrieval quality by having an expert specify the expected rank ordering with respect to each query for a set of test queries. This enables us to assess the quality of algorithms comprehensively for retrieval in image databases. The characteristics of the proposed algorithm are compared with those of the previously available algorithms using a testbed of images. The comparison demonstrated that our algorithm is not only more efficient but also provides a rank ordering of images that consistently matches with the expert's expected rank ordering. © 1995, ACM.

Five perspectives on exceptions provide insights into why exceptions occur and how they might be eliminated or more efficiently handled. We investigate these perspectives using an in-depth study of an operating information process that has frequent exceptions. Our results support the use of a total quality management 1995 approach of eliminating exceptions for some exceptions, in particular, those caused by computer systems that are poor matches to organizational processes. However, some exceptions are explained better by a political system perspective of conflicting goals between subunits. For these exceptions and several other types, designing an integrated human-computer process will provide better performance than will eliminating exceptions and moving toward an entirely automated process. © 1995, ACM.

Users of this system can create applications by combining and modifying four kinds of building blocks: objects, views, agents, and links. We found that user-level tailoring of these primitives can provide most of the functionality found in well-known cooperative work systems such as gIBIS, Coordinator, Lotus Notes, and Information Lens. These primitives, therefore, appear to provide an elementary “tailoring language” out of which a wide variety of integrated information management and collaboration applications can be constructed by end users. © 1995, ACM.

Such multimedia information servers must not only support retrieval of continuous media units 1995, but also preserve synchrony among playback of the different media components constituting a multimedia object. We develop techniques for supporting continuous and synchronous retrieval from multimedia servers. We present feedback techniques by which, during retrieval of multimedia objects from a multimedia server to mediaphones, the multimedia server uses lightweight messages called feedback units transmitted periodically back to it (by mediaphones) to detect impending discontinuities as well as asynchronies at mediaphones. The multimedia server then preventively readjusts media transmission so as to avoid either anomaly, and steers the mediaphones back to synchrony. Given the available buffer sizes at mediaphones and the maximum tolerable asynchrony, we present methods to determine the minimum rate at which feedback units must be transmitted so as to maintain both continuity and synchronization. These feedback techniques remain robust even in the presence of playback rate mismatches and network delay jitter, and their initial simulation for video-audio playback yields a feedback rate of one per 1,000 media units to keep the asynchrony within 250ms, showing that the overhead due to feedback transmission is very small. The constant rate feedback techniques developed in this article form the basis of a prototype on-demand information server being developed at the UCSD Multimedia Laboratory. © 1995, ACM.

On the Expressive Power of Query Languages,1994,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028054597&doi=10.1145%2f174608.174611&partnerID=40&md5=ad3cb208a79353535995f9941a578759,"Two main topics are addressed. First, an algebraic approach is presented to define a general notion of expressive power. Heterogeneous algebras represent information systems and morphisms represent the correspondences between the instances of databases, the correspondences between answers, and the correspondences between queries. An important feature of this new notion of expressive power is that query languages of different types can be compared with respect to their expressive power. In the case of relational query languages, the new notion of expressive power is shown to be equivalent to the notion used by Chandra and Harel. In the case of nonrelational query languages, the versatility of the new notion of expressive power is demonstrated by comparing the fixpoint query languages with an object-oriented query language called FQL. The expressive power of the Functional Query Language FQL is the second main topic of this paper. The specifications of FQL functions can be recursive or even mutually recursive, FQL has a fixpoint semantics based on a complete lattice consisting of bag functions. The query language FQL is shown to be more expressive than the fixpoint query languages. This result implies that FQL is also more expressive than Datalog with stratified negation. Examples of recursive FQL functions are given that determine the ancestors of persons and the bill of materials. © 1994, ACM.

The evaluation used a variety of methods to address questions about learning and teaching with hypermedia and to guide the development of early versions of the system. Results illustrate that such environments offer potential for accelerating learning and for supporting new types of learning and teaching; that students and instructors must develop new strategies for learning and teaching with such technology; and that institutions must develop infrastructural support for such technology. The results also illustrate the importance of well-designed interfaces and different types of assignments on user performance. © 1994, ACM.

We draw these trends together in a data model we call the Hypernode Model. The single data structure of this model is the hypernode, a graph whose nodes can themselves be graphs. Hypernodes are typed, and types, too, are nested graphs. We give the theoretical foundations of hypernodes and types, and we show that type checking is tractable. We show also how conventional type-forming operators can be simulated by our graph types, including cyclic types. The Hypernode Model comes equipped with a rule-based query language called Hyperlog, which is complete with respect to computation and update. We define the operational semantics of Hyperlog and show that the evaluation can be performed efficiently. We discuss also the use of Hyperlog for supporting database browsing, an essential feature of Hypertext databases. We compare our work with other graph-based data models—unlike previous graph-based models, the Hypernode Model provides inherent support for data abstraction via its nesting of graphs. Finally, we briefly discuss the implementation of a DBMS based on the Hypernode Model. © 1994, ACM.

Previous reports indicate that human-engineered rule-based systems, requiring many man-years of developmental efforts, have been successfully built to “read” documents and assign topics to them. We show that machine-generated decision rules appear comparable to human performance, while using the identical rule-based representation. In comparison with other machine-learning techniques, results on a key benchmark from the Reuters collection show a large gain in performance, from a previously reported 67% recall/precision breakeven point to 80.5%. In the context of a very high-dimensional feature space, several methodological alternatives are examined, including universal versus local dictionaries, and binary versus frequency-related features. © 1994, ACM.

We propose a negotiation protocol, SANP (Speech-Act-based Negotiation Protocol), which is based on Ballmer and Brennenstuhl's speech act classification and on negotiation analysis literature. The protocol is implemented as a domain-independent system using Strudel, which is an electronic mail toolkit. A small study tested the potential use of the protocol. Although a number of limitations were found in the study, the protocol appears to have potential in domains without these limitations, and it can serve as a building block to design more general negotiation protocols. © 1994, ACM.

In this paper, we propose a logical, qualitative problem-solving scheme for CKBS that uses social choice theory as a formal basis for making joint decisions and promoting conflict resolution. This scheme consists of three steps: (1) the selection of decision criteria and competing alternatives, (2) the formation of preference profiles and collective choices, and (3) the negotiation among agents as conflicts arise in group decision making. In this paper, we focus on the computational mechanisms developed to support steps (2) and (3) of the scheme. In addition, the practicality of the scheme is illustrated with examples taken from a working prototype dealing with collaborative structural design of buildings. © 1994, ACM.

Information Extraction as a Basis for High-Precision Text Classification,1994,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028460389&doi=10.1145%2f183422.183428&partnerID=40&md5=2730753c34e4213006a79239e2bc5d87,"We describe an approach to text classification that represents a compromise between traditional word-based techniques and in-depth natural language processing. Our approach uses a natural language processing task called “information extraction” as a basis for high-precision text classification. We present three algorithms that use varying amounts of extracted information to classify texts. The relevancy signatures algorithm uses linguistic phrases; the augmented relevancy signatures algorithm uses phrases and local context; and the case-based text classification algorithm uses larger pieces of context. Relevant phrases and contexts are acquired automatically using a training corpus. We evaluate the algorithms on the basis of two test sets from the MUC-4 corpus. All three algorithms achieved high precision on both test sets, with the augmented relevancy signatures algorithm and the case-based algorithm reaching 100% precision with over 60% recall on one set. Additionally, we compare the algorithms on a larger collection of 1700 texts and describe an automated method for empirically deriving appropriate threshold values. The results suggest that information extraction techniques can support high-precision text classification and, in general, that using more extracted information improves performance. As a practical matter, we also explain how the text classification system can be easily ported across domains. © 1994, ACM.

The model evaluates a large incoming stream of documents to determine which documents are sufficiently similar to a profile at the broad subject level to warrant more refined representation and matching. To accomplish this task, each substantive word in a text is first categorized using a feature set based on the semantic Subject Field Codes 1994 assigned to individual word senses in a machine-readable dictionary. When tested on 50 user profiles and 550 megabytes of documents, results indicate that the feature set that is the basis of the text categorization module and the algorithm that establishes the boundary of categories of potentially relevant documents accomplish their tasks with a high level of performance. This means that the category of potentially relevant documents for most profiles would contain at least 80% of all documents later determined to be relevant to the profile. The number of documents in this set would be uniquely determined by the system's category-boundary predictor, and this set is likely to contain less than 5% of the incoming stream of documents. © 1994, ACM.

We use a training set of manually categorized documents to learn word-category associations, and use these associations to predict the categories of arbitrary documents. Similarly, we use a training set of queries and their related documents to obtain empirical associations between query words and indexing terms of documents, and use these associations to predict the related documents of arbitrary queries. A Linear Least Squares Fit 1994 technique is employed to estimate the likelihood of these associations. Document collections from the MEDLINE database and Mayo patient records are used for studies on the effectiveness of our approach, and on how much the effectiveness depends on the choices of training data, indexing language, word-weighting scheme, and morphological canonicalization. Alternative methods are also tested on these data collections for comparison. It is evident that the LLSF approach uses the relevance information effectively within human decisions of categorization and retrieval, and achieves a semantic mapping of free texts to their representations in an indexing language. Such a semantic mapping lead to a significant improvement in categorization and retrieval, compared to alternative approaches. © 1994, ACM.

Such interpretations of technology 1994 are central to understanding technological development, use, and change in organizations. We suggest that where the technological frames of key groups in organizations—such as managers, technologists, and users— are significantly different, difficulties and conflict around the development, use, and change of technology may result. We use the findings of an empirical study to illustrate how the nature, value, and use of a groupware technology were interpreted by various organizational stakeholders, resulting in outcomes that deviated from those expected. We argue that technological frames offer an interesting and useful analytic perspective for explaining an anticipating actions and meanings that are not easily obtained with other theoretical lenses. © 1994, ACM.

Finding a Happy Medium: Explaining the Negative Effects of Electronic Communication on Social Life at Work,1994,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028406160&doi=10.1145%2f196734.196738&partnerID=40&md5=1cef5b8e0298167a810091acf3767760,"The sometimes observed negative social effects of electronic communication technology are often attributed to the characteristics of the technology itself. Electronic mail, for instance, filters out personal and social cues and provides new capabilities not found in traditional media, and it has been argued that these factors have consequences such as “flaming” and depersonalization. Alternative theoretical perspectives on the impacts of information technology suggest that our ability to explain these outcomes might be enhanced by attending to users' intentional choices about how to use technology and to unpredictable technology usage patterns that emerge when users interact with the technology and each other. These alternative perspectives are examined in the context of an exploratory case study of a complex organization in which electronic mail was heavily used. Users were found to select email deliberately when they wished to avoid unwanted social interactions. At the same time, they actively took steps to avoid negative outcomes, such as depersonalization of their relationships with subordinates. However, despite their well-intentioned efforts, some negative social effects did occur that cannot entirely be attributed to the technological characteristics of electronic communication. Instead, they appear to be ironic side effects of users' thoughtful efforts to use email effectively. These results suggest the value of according a prominent role in explanations of technology impacts to users' intended and unintended technology uses. The results also imply that negative social effects from using electronic communication technology may not prove easy to eradicate, despite technological developments such as multimedia integration, and despite efforts to train users in the best email “etiquette”. © 1994, ACM.

Rich and Lean Representations of Information for Knowledge Work: The Role of Computing Packages in the Work of Classical Scholars,1994,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028405667&doi=10.1145%2f196734.196746&partnerID=40&md5=fc0ccc80854e8ac4bf6474b76cb94cfd,"Applying information systems to complex intellectual tasks requires the representation and codification of ambiguous and fragmentary forms of data. This application effects changes not only in representation of this data, but in the relationships between users and tools, techniques, or systems for data interpretation. It also affects the complex infrastructures that support this process. This article uses a package metaphor to examine the impact on one domain of knowledge work, classical scholarship, of the “computerization” of a key data source, the textual edition. The construction of one on-line textual databank, the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae 1994, has altered the traditional relationships between text “owners” and “users” has changed the role of the text as a conduit for social and historical information, and has disrupted traditional patterns of transmitting domain expertise. A rich information resource has become lean in its electronic form. The TLG has standardized the corpus of Greek literature and eased access to a broad range of works, including rare and out-of-print materials. At the same time, its construction has decoupled often-contested textual sources from their accompanying critical notes and supplemental materials. The use of the TLG has also shifted notions of objectivity, accuracy, and requisite expertise within the community. The transmission of domain knowledge must now be coupled with the transmission of technical knowledge, a process for which no infrastructure is currently in place. These experiences parallel those of other knowledge workers. “Mechanistic” paradigms of information and knowledge cannot accommodate important components of computing packages, including the transmission of expertise and infrastructures for tool development and evaluation. Recent developments in information storage and dissemination, including gophers and ftp sites may indicate that despite technical advances that could be used to support rich representations (such as hypermedia and multimedia), leaner forms of data may prevail. © 1994, ACM.

The case study is used to develop some general implications on IS strategy and implementation, which can be taken as themes for debate in any new situation. The paper provides an example of a more detailed perspective on processes in IS strategy and implementation than typically available in the literature.

A structured approach to hypertext development suggests the notion of authoring-in-the-large. Authoring-in-the-large allows the description of overall classes of information elements and navigational structures of complex applications without much concern with implementation details, and in a system-independent manner. The paper presents HDM 1993, a first step towards defining a general purpose model for authoring-in-the-large. Some of the most innovative features of HDM are: the notion of perspective; the identification of different categories of links (structural links, application links, and perspective links) with different representational roles; the distinction between hyperbase and access structures; and the possibility of easily integrating the structure of a hypertext application with its browsing semantics. HDM can be used in different manners: as a modeling device or as an implementation device. As a modeling device, it supports producing high level specifications of existing or to-be-developed applications. As an implementation device, it is the basis for designing tools that directly support application development. One of the central advantages of HDM in the design and practical construction of hypertext applications is that the definition of a significant number of links can be derived automatically from a conceptual-design level description.

A prototypic system called HB1 is being designed to meet the storage needs of next-generation hypermedia system architectures. HB1 is referred to as a hyperbase management system 1993 because it supports, not only the storage and manipulation of information, but the storage and manipulation of the connectivity data that link information together to form hypermedia. Among HB1's distinctions is its use of a semantic network database system to manage physical storage. Here, basic semantic modeling concepts as they apply to hypermedia systems are reviewed, and experiences using a semantic database system in HB1 are discussed. Semantic data models attempt to provide more powerful mechanisms for structuring objects than are provided by traditional approaches. In HB1, it was necessary to abstract interobject connectivity, behaviors, and information for hypermedia. Building on top of a semantic database system facilitated such a separation and made the structural aspects of hypermedia conveniently accessible to manipulation. This becomes particularly important in the implementation of structure-related operations such as structural queries. Our experience suggests that an integrated semantic object-oriented database paradigm appears to be superior to purely relational, semantic, or object-oriented methodologies for representing the structurally complex interrelationships that arise in hypermedia. © 1993, ACM.

First, the designs produced by the 19 groups of three designers were of higher quality than those of the 19 groups who worked with conventional whiteboard, paper and pencil. The groups with the new tool reported liking their work process a little less, probably because they had to adapt their work style to a new tool. We expected, from the brainstorming literature and recent work on Group Support Systems, that the reason the designs were of better quality was that the supported groups generated more ideas. To our surprise, the groups working with ShrEdit generated fewer design ideas, but apparently better ones. It appears that the tool helped the supported groups keep more focused on the core issued in the emerging design, to waste less time on less important topics, and to capture what was said as they went. This suggests that small workgroups can capitalize on the free access they have to a shared workspace, without requiring a facilitator or a work process embedded in the software. © 1993, ACM.

We demonstrate the value of this approach in accessing relevant items from a collection of empirical abstracts in a medical domain. The advantage, when compared to traditional keyword retrieval, is that this approach is a significant move towards knowledge representation and retrieval. Text representation in this model includes keywords and their conceptual roles in the text. In particular, it involves extracting TOPIC predicates representing the research issue addressed and DESIGN predicates representing important methodological features of the empirical study. Preliminary experimentation shows that keywords exhibit a variety of text-grammar roles in a text database. Second, as intuitively expected, retrieval using TOPIC predicates identifies a smaller subset of texts than Boolean retrieval does. These empirical results along with the theoretical work indicate that the representation and retrieval strategies proposed have a significant potential. Finally, EMPIRICIST, a prototype system is described. In it the text representation predicates are implemented as a network while retrieval is through constrained-spreading activation strategies. © 1993, ACM.

Our approach has focused on ubiquitous audio, or the unobtrusive capture of speech interactions in everyday work environments. Speech recognition technology cannot yet transcribe fluent conversational speech, so the words themselves are not available for organizing the captured interactions. Instead, the structure of an interaction is derived from acoustical information inherent in the stored speech and augmented by user interaction during or after capture. This article describes applications for capturing and structuring audio from office discussions and telephone calls, and mechanisms for later retrieval of these stored interactions. An important aspect of retrieval is choosing an appropriate visual representation, and this article describes the evolution of a family of representations across a range of applications.

Virtual Reality for Palmtop Computers,1993,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027629550&doi=10.1145%2f159161.159160&partnerID=40&md5=fb7ce3c4943c327b10114e3ea620327f,"We are exploring how virtual reahty theories can be applied toward palmtop computers. In our prototype, called the Chameleon, a small 4-inch hand-held monitor acts as a palmtop computer with the capabihties of a Silicon graphics workstation. A 6D input device and a response button are attached to tbe small monitor to detect user gestures and input selections for issuing commands. An experiment was conducted to evaluate our design and to see how well depth could be perceived in the small screen compared to a large 21-inch screen, and the extent to which movement of the small display (in a palmtop virtual reality condition) could improve depth perception, Results show that with very little training, perception of depth in the palmtop virtual reality condition is about as good as corresponding depth perception in a large (but static) display. Variations to the initial design are also discussed, along with issues to be explored in future research, Our research suggests that palmtop virtual reality may support effective navigation and search and retrieval, in rich and portable information spaces. © 1993, ACM.

The approximation is based on well-known results from probability theory, and, as shown by simulations, introduces no appreciable errors when compared with the exact, cumbersome formulas used so far. Furthermore, we prove that the exact formulas for the two methods coincide. Although this does not imply that the two methods behave in the same way, it sheds light on the way they could be compared. © 1993, ACM.

It provides users with a set of tools for building custom interfaces with minimal programming. This is accomplished by combining techniques from User Interface Management Systems 1993 with a built-in knowledge about the specific kinds of techniques used by object-oriented databases. DBface allows users to create graphical constructs and interactive techniques by taking advantage of an object-oriented database environment and tools. Not only can database tools be used for creating an interface, but information about the interface being built is stored within a database schema and is syntactically consistent with all other schema information. Thus, an interface can deal with data and schema information, including information about another interface. This allows for easy reusability of graphical constructs such as data representations. © 1993, ACM.

First, we examine the implicit assumptions embodied in the method about the nature of organizations, work processes, and design. Following this we present the results of an exploratory study, conducted to find out how the method is applied in practice. This study reveals that while some of the tools of Structured Analysis—notably the data flow diagrams—are used and combined with other tools, the designers do not follow the analysis and design procedures prescribed by the method.

This style is best suited to application areas where traditional two-dimensional styles fall short, such as scientific visualization, architectural visualization, and remote manipulation. Currently, the programming effort required to produce a VR application is too large, and many pitfalls must be avoided in the creation of successful VR programs. In this article we describe the Decoupled Simulation Model (DSM) for creating successful VR applications, and a software system that embodies this model. The MR Toolkit simplifies the development of VR applications by providing standard facilities required by a wide range of VR user interfaces. These facilities include support for distributed computing, head-mounted displays, room geometry management, performance monitoring, hand input devices, and sound (audio) feedback. The MR Toolkit encourages programmers to structure their applications to take advantage of the distributed computing capabilities of workstation networks, improving the application�s performance, In this article, the motivations and the architecture of the toolkit are outlined; the programmer�s view is described; and a simple application is briefly described. © 1993, ACM.

In addition, the environment offers tools for aiding the mapping process from requirements to design and then to implementation, also for representing decisions reached during the development process.

Delay-sensitive data include digital audio, animations, and video. Retrieval of these data types from secondary storage has to satisfy certain time constraints in order to be acceptable to the user. The presentation is based on digital audio in order to provide intuition to the reader, although the results are applicable to all delay-sensitive data. A theoretical framework is developed for the real-time requirements of digital audio playback. We show how to describe these requirements in terms of the consumption rate of the audio data and the nature of the data-retrieval rate from secondary storage. Making use of this framework, bounds are derived for buffer space requirements for certain common retrieval scenarios. Storage placement strategies for multichannel synchronized data are then categorized and examined. The results presented in this paper are basic to any playback of delay-sensitive data and should assist the multimedia system designer in estimating hardware requirements and in evaluating possible design choices. © 1992, ACM.

However, direct manipulation interfaces incur high cost in their creation. To cope with this problem, we present a model of bidirectional translation between pictures and abstract application data, and a prototype system, TRIP2, based on this model. Using this model, general mapping from abstract data to pictures and from pictures to abstract data is realized merely by giving declarative mapping rules, allowing fast and easy creation of direct manipulation interfaces. We apply the prototype system to the generation of the interfaces for kinship diagrams, Graph Editors, E-R diagrams, and an Othello game. © 1992, ACM.

"Lessons Learned from SUIT, the Simple User Interface Toolkit",1992,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0026933485&doi=10.1145%2f146486.146489&partnerID=40&md5=6f4d66162239ff362a2f88c2b2a0b711,"In recent years, the computer science community has realized the advantages of GUIs 1992. Because high-quality GUIs are difficult to build, support tools such as UIMSs, UI Toolkits, and Interface Builders have been developed. Although these tools are powerful, they typically make two assumptions: first, that the programmer has some familiarity with the GUI model, and second, that he is willing to invest several weeks becoming proficient with the tool. These tools typically operate only on specific platforms, such as DOS, the Macintosh, or UNIX/X-windows. The existing tools are beyond the reach of most undergraduate computer science majors, or professional programmers who wish to quickly build GUIs without investing the time to become specialists in GUI design. For this class of users, we developed SUIT, the Simple User Iinterface Toolkit. SUIT is an attempt to distill the fundamental components of an interface builder and GUI toolkit, and to explain those concepts with the tool itself, all in a short period of time. We have measured that college juniors with no previous GUI programming experience can use SUIT productively after less than three hours. SUIT is a C subroutine library which provides an external control UIMS, an interactive layout editor, and a set of standard “widgets,” such as sliders, buttons, and check boxes. SUIT-based applications run transparently across the Macintosh, DOS, and UNIX/X platforms. SUIT has been exported to hundreds of external sites on the internet. This paper describes SUIT's architecture, the design decisions we made during its development, and the lessons we learned from extensive observations of over 120 users. © 1992, ACM.

A Model for Input and Output of Multilingual Text in a Windowing Environment,1992,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0026933484&doi=10.1145%2f146486.146558&partnerID=40&md5=638b9c00e09e63d8b23ffe25c0b4974d,"The layered multilingual input/output1992 sytems we designed, based on typological studies of major-language writing conventions, unifies common features of such conventions to enable international and local utilization. The internationalization layer input module converts keystroke sequences to phonograms and ideograms. The corresponding output module displays position-independent and dependent characters. The localization layer positions language-specific functions outside the structure, integrating them as tables used by finite automaton interpreters and servers to add new languages and code sets without recompilation. The I/O system generates and displays stateful and stateless code sets, enabling interactive language switching. Going beyond POSIX locale model bounds, the system generates ISO 2022, ISO/DIS 10646 (1990), and Compound Text, defined for the interchange encoding format in X11 protocols, for basic polyglot text communication and processing. Able to generate multilingual code sets, the I/O system clearly demonstrates that code sets should be selected by applications which have purposes beyond selecting one element from a localization set. Functionality and functions related to text manipulation in an operating sytem (OS) must also be determined by such applications. A subset of this I/O system was implemented in the X window system as a basic use of X11R5 I/O by supplying basic code set generation and string manipulation to eliminate OS interference. To ensure polyglot string manipulation, the I/O system must clearly be implemented separately from an OS and its limitations. © 1992, ACM.

The framework is based on a generalized editing interaction model, which allows users to view programs as active data that can be concurrently edited by multiple users. It consists of several novel components including a refinement of both the Seeheim UIMS architecture and the distributed graphics architecture that explicitly addresses multiuser interaction; the abstractions of shared active variables and interaction variables, which allow users and applications to exchange information; a set of default collaboration rules designed to keep the collaboration-awareness low in multiuser programs; and a small but powerful set of primitives for overriding these rules. The framework allows users to be dynamically added and removed from a multiuser sesssion, different users to use different user interfaces to interact with an application, the modules interacting with a particular user to execute on the local workstation, and programmers to incrementally trade automation for flexibility. We have implemented the framework as part of a system called Suite. This paper motivates, describes, and illustrates the framework using the concrete example of Suite, discusses how it can be implemented in other kinds of systems, compares it with related work, discusses its shortcomings, and suggests directions for future work. © 1992, ACM.

Existing document editors can be modified to participate in this open architecture with the addition of a few simple routines. Unlike many button systems that insert special button objects into document media, this system supports turning existing document objects into buttons. As a consequence, buttons inherit all of the attributes of normal document objects, and the appearance of buttons can be edited using operations already familiar to users. Facilities are provided for linking buttons to application windows so that documents can serve as application control panels. Hence, user interface designers can lay out control panels using familiar document editors rather than special-purpose tools. Three classes of buttons have been implemented, including buttons that pop up a menu and buttons that store and display the value of a variable. New button classes, editors, and applications can be added at run time. Two editors, one for text and one for graphics, currently participate in the architecture. © 1992, ACM.

However, little quantitative information is available about the extent of the problem or about the impact that it has on information retrieval systems. We report on an analysis of lexical ambiguity in information retrieval test collections and on experiments to determine the utility of word meanings for separating relevant from nonrelevant documents. The experiments show that there is considerable ambiguity even in a specialized database. Word senses provide a significant separation between relevant and nonrelevant documents, but several factors contribute to determining whether disambiguation will make an improvement in performance. For example, resolving lexical ambiguity was found to have little impact on retrieval effectiveness for documents that have many words in common with the query. Other uses of word sense disambiguation in an information retrieval context are discussed. © 1992, ACM.

Standard UNIMEM and COBWEB implementations have been modified to support queries as input. Based on the results of experiments with these modified implementations, the whole approach appears to be quite promising, expecially if the concept hierarchy from which the learning algorithms start their processing is initialized with some of the most obvious concepts captured in the database. © 1992, ACM.

One solution to this problem is improved authoring to create more comprehensible structures. This paper proposes several authoring tools, based on hypertext structure analysis. In many hypertext systems authors are encouraged to create hierarchical structures, but when writing, the hierarchy is lost because of the inclusion of cross-reference links. The first part of this paper looks at ways of recovering lost hierarchies and finding new ones, offering authors different views of the same hypertext. The second part helps authors by identifying properties of the hypertext document. Multiple metrics are developed including compactness and stratum. Compactness indicates the intrinsic connectedness of the hypertext, and stratum reveals to what degree the hypertext is organized so that some nodes must be read before others. Several existing hypertexts are used to illustrate the benefits of each technique. The collection of techniques provides a multifaceted view of the hypertext, which should allow authors to reduce undesired structural complexity and create documents that readers can traverse more easily. © 1992, ACM.

Optimal Placement of High-Probability Randomly Retrieved Blocks on CLV Optical Discs,1991,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976795548&doi=10.1145%2f103731.103732&partnerID=40&md5=11937cdaa059c38591c4e36d6217d450,"Optimal data placement on a CLV 1991 format optical discs has an objective the minimization of the expected access cost of data retrievals from the disc when the probabilities of access of data items may be different. The problem of optimal data placement for optical discs is both important and more difficult than the corresponding problem on magnetic discs. A good data placement on optical discs is more important because data sets on optical discs such as WORM and CD ROM cannot be modified or moved once they are placed on disc. Currently, even rewritable optical discs are best suited for applications that are archival in nature. The problem of optimal data placement on CLV format optical discs is more difficult, mainly because the useful storage space is not uniformly distributed across the disc surface (along the radius). This leads to a complicated positional performance trade-off not present for magnetic disks. We present a model that encompasses all the important aspects of the placement problem on CLV format optical discs. The model takes into account the nonuniform distribution of useful storage, the dependency of the rotational delay on disc position, a parameterized seek cost function for optical discs, and the varying access probabilities of data items. We show that the optimal placement of high-probability blocks satisfies a unimodality property. Based on this observation, we solve the optimal placement problem. We then study the impact of the relative weights of the problem parameters and show that the optimal data placement may be very different from the optimal data placement on magnetic disks. We also validate our model and analysis and give an algorithm for computing the placement of disc sectors. © 1991, ACM. All rights reserved.",management; performance,

The shared database is accessible to all authorized users of the system, while each private database is accessible to only the user who owns it. A distributed database system with a shared database and private databases for individual users is a natural architecture for data-intensive application environments on a network of workstations, notably computer-aided design and engineering systems. This paper discusses the benefits and limitations of such a system and explores the impact of such an architecture on the semantics and implementation of some of the key functions of a database system, notably queries, database schema, and versions.

The model employs object-orientation in describing organizational units as well as individual users as entities with uniform external interfaces. Each entity is represented by an autonomous user agent which operates on local and migrating forms. The form concept encapsulates data, layout, and rules into a unified object which is the basic unit of presentation, processing, storage, and communication. All functionality of the system appears in rules of form classes and all data in instances of these form classes. This approach applies the techniques of computer supported cooperative work to provide a flexible mechanism for interpersonal, intraoffice, and interoffice procedures. The main challenge is to organize the collaboration without affecting the autonomy of individual user agents. In this respect, the contribution of the model is the mechanism for form migration. The dynamic integration of forms into different agents is solved with the coordinated interchange of form classes. A specific inheritance scheme provides the desired flexibility by separating the interrelated private and public form operations within each agent. The paper first describes the architecture by starting from a single agent and moving progressively towards a set of cooperating agents. Then an agent implementation called PAGES is described, experiences reported, and the open issues discussed. A typical distributed ordering procedure is used as an example throughout the text. © 1990, ACM.

It is, for example, becoming increasingly important for satisfying the requirements of fitting a large database onto a single CD-ROM. Many of the compression techniques discussed in the literature are model based. We here propose the notion of a formal grammar as a flexible model of text generation that encompasses most of the models offered before as well as, in principle, extending the possibility of compression to a much more general class of languages. Assuming a general model of text generation, a derivation is given of the well known Shannon entropy formula, making possible a theory of information based upon text representation rather than on communication. The ideas are shown to apply to a number of commonly used text models. Finally, we focus on a Markov model of text generation, suggest an information theoretic measure of similarity between two probability distributions, and develop a clustering algorithm based on this measure. This algorithm allows us to cluster Markov states, and thereby base our compression algorithm on a smaller number of probability distributions than would otherwise have been required. A number of theoretical consequences of this approach to compression are explored, and a detailed example is given. © 1990, ACM.

Critics make the constructed artifact “talk back” to the user. Conditions under which critics are more appropriate than autonomous expert systems are discussed. Critics should be embedded in integrated design environments along with other components, such as an argumentative hypertext system, a specification component, and a catalog. Critics support learning as a by-product of problem solving. The major subprocesses of critiquing are goal acquisition, product analysis, critiquing strategies, adaptation capability, explanation and argumentation, and advisory capability. The generality of the critiquing approach is demonstrated by discussing critiquing systems developed in our group and elsewhere. Limitations of many current critics include their inability to learn about specific user goals and their intervention strategies. © 1991, ACM.

Partially Shared Views: A Scheme for Communicating Among Groups that use Different Type Hierarchies,1990,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025207708&doi=10.1145%2f78915.78916&partnerID=40&md5=a5b31428fa1004b90b153aacfb550ba9,"Many computer systems are based on various types of messages, forms, or other objects. When users of such systems need to communicate with people who use different object types, some kind of translation is necessary. In this paper, we explore the space of general solutions to this translation problem and propose a scheme that synthesizes these solutions. After first illustrating the problem in the Object Lens system, we identify two partly conflicting objectives that any translation scheme should satisfy: preservation of meaning and autonomous evolution of group languages. Then we partition the space of possible solutions to this problem in terms of the set theoretic relations between group languages and a common language. This leads to five primary solution classes and we illustrate and evaluate each one. Finally, we describe a composite scheme, called Partially Shared Views, that combines many of the best features of the other schemes. A key insight of the analysis is that partially shared type hierarchies allow “foreign” object types to be automatically translated into their nearest common “ancestor” types. The partial interoperability attained in this way makes possible flexible standards from which people can benefit from whatever agreements they do have without having to agree on everything. Even though our examples deal primarily with extensions to the Object Lens system, the analysis also suggests how other kinds of systems, such as EDI applications, might exploit specialization hierarchies of object types to simplify the translation problem. © 1990, ACM.

New graphics standards are still using a fifteen-year-old model even though it is widely accepted as inadequate, and most modern window managers simply return a stream of low-level, device-dependent input events. This paper presents a new model that handles input devices for highly interactive, direct manipulation, graphical user interfaces, which could be used in future toolkits, window managers, and graphics standards. This model encapsulates interactive behaviors into a few “Interactor” object types. Application programs can then create instances of these Interactor objects which hide the details of the underlying window manager events. In addition, Interactors allow a clean separation between the input handling, the graphics, and the application programs.

The more traditional query method returns an answer set that may consist of data values 1990, items containing the answer (full text), or items referring the user to items containing the answer (bibliographic). Browsing within a database, as best exemplified by hypertext systems, consists of viewing a database item and linking to related items on the basis of some attribute or attribute value. A model of data access has been developed that supports both query and browse access methods. The model is based on hypergraph representation of data instances. The hyperedges and nodes are manipulated through a set of operators to compose new nodes and to instantiate new links dynamically, resulting in transient hypergraphs. These transient hypergraphs are virtual structures created in response to user queries, and lasting only as long as the query session. The model provides a framework for general data access that accommodates user-directed browsing and querying, as well as traditional models of information and data retrieval, such as the Boolean, vector space, and probabilistic models. Finally, the relational database model is shown to provide a reasonable platform for the implementation of this transient hypergraph-based model of data access. © 1990, ACM.

Indeed, the language is appropriate for representing knowledge about a variety of worlds related to a particular information system, such as the subject world 1990, the usage world (user models, environments), the system world (software requirements, design), and the development world (teams, metodologies). We introduce the features of the language through examples, focusing on those provided for desribing metaconcepts that can then be used to describe knowledge relevant to a particular information system.

This paper describes OPUS, the user interface editor of the Penguims UIMS. This system allows the presentation component of graphical user interfaces to be specified interactively in a graphical notation without explicit programming. The Penguims UIMS supports an underlying model of computation based loosely on spreadsheets. In particular, it supports incremental computations based on a system of equations 1990 over a set of named values (spreadsheet cells). These equations are used to provide immediate feedback at all levels of the interface. They are used to incrementally determine the position and dynamic appearance of the individual interactor objects that make up the interface. They are also used to connect the presentation directly to underlying application data thereby supporting semantic feedback. The OPUS user interface editor employs a special graphical notation for specifying the presentation component of a user interface. This notation allows the power of the underlying computational model to be expressed simply and quickly. The resulting presentations are very flexible in nature.

The style rule layer defines the presentation and behavior of a family of interaction techniques. Finally, the style program layer implements primitive toolkit objects that are composed by the rule layer into complete interaction techniques.

Experiments with a Component Theory of Probabilistic Information Retrieval Based on Single Terms as Document Components,1990,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025497497&doi=10.1145%2f102675.102677&partnerID=40&md5=30e918ff91e6786adaa769393525890f,"A component theory of information retrieval using single content terms as component for queries and documents was reviewed and experimented with. The theory has the advantages of being able to 1990 bootstrap itself, that is, define initial term weights naturally based on the fact that items are self relevent; (2) make use of within-item term frequencies; (3) account for query-focused and document-focused indexing and retrieval strategies cooperatively; and (4) allow for component-specific feedback if such information is available. Retrieval results with four collections support the effectiveness of all the first three aspects, except for predictive retrieval. At the initial indexing stage, the retrieval theory performed much more consistantly across collections than croft's model and provided results comparable to Salton's tf*idf approach. An inverse collection term frequency (ICTF) formula was also tested that performed much better than the inverse document frequency (IDF). With full feedback retrospective retrieval, the component theory performed substantially better than Croft's, because of the highly specific nature of document-focused feedback. Repetitive retireval results with partial relevance feedback mirrored those for the retrospective. However, for the important case of predictive retrieval using residual ranking, results were not unequivocal. © 1990, ACM.

But it is in the behavioral domain of the user that interface designers and evaluators do their work. We are seeking to complement constructional methods by providing a tool-supported technique capable of specifying the behavioral aspects of an interactive system–the tasks and the actions a user performs to accomplish those tasks. In particular, this paper is a practical introduction to use of the User Action Notation 1990, a task- and user-oriented notation for behavioral representation of asynchronous, direct manipulation interface designs. Interfaces are specified in UAN as a quasihierarchy of asynchronous tasks. At the lower levels, user actions are associated with feedback and system state changes. The notation makes use of visually onomatopoeic symbols and is simple enough to read with little instruction. UAN is being used by growing numbers of interface developers and researchers. In addition to its design role, current research is investigating how UAN can support production and maintenance of code and documentation. © 1990, ACM.

Problems arise when some of the data are missing or imprecisely known or when an attribute is not applicable to a particular object. A consistent and useful treatment of such exceptions is necessary. The approach taken here is to allow any attribute value to be a regular precise value, a string denoting that the value is missing, a string denoting that the attribute is not applicable, or an imprecise value. The imprecise values introduce uncertainty into query evaluation, since it is no longer obvious which objects should be retrieved. To handle the uncertainty, two set of objects are retrieved in response to every query: the set of objects that are known to satisfy with complete certainty and the set that possibly satisfies the query with various degrees of uncertainty. Two methods of estimating this uncertainty, based on information theory, are proposed. The measure of uncertainty is used to rank objects for presentation to a user. © 1990, ACM.

Optimum Polynomial Retrieval Functions Based on the Probability Ranking Principle,1989,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024689802&doi=10.1145%2f65943.65944&partnerID=40&md5=649e62f197f3a29c134f37fb36137344,"We show that any approach to developing optimum retrieval functions is based on two kinds of assumptions: first, a certain form of representation for documents and requests, and second, additional simplifying assumptions that predefine the type of the retrieval function. Then we describe an approach for the development of optimum polynomial retrieval functions: request-document pairs (fl, dm) are mapped onto description vectors x(fl, dm), and a polynomial function e(x) is developed such that it yields estimates of the probability of relevance P(R | x (fl, dm) with minimum square errors. We give experimental results for the application of this approach to documents with weighted indexing as well as to documents with complex representations. In contrast to other probabilistic models, our approach yields estimates of the actual probabilities, it can handle very complex representations of documents and requests, and it can be easily applied to multivalued relevance scales. On the other hand, this approach is not suited to log-linear probabilistic models and it needs large samples of relevance feedback data for its application. © 1989, ACM.

A Critical Investigation of Recall and Precision as Measures of Retrieval System Performance,1989,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024689801&doi=10.1145%2f65943.65945&partnerID=40&md5=3b15e2b2b7a9c4f3f45afe933397333f,"Recall and precision are often used to evaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval systems. They are easy to define if there is a single query and if the retrieval result generated for the query is a linear ordering. However, when the retrieval results are weakly ordered, in the sense that several documents have an identical retrieval status value with respect to a query, some probabilistic notion of precision has to be introduced. Relevance probability, expected precision, and so forth, are some alternatives mentioned in the literature for this purpose. Furthermore, when many queries are to be evaluated and the retrieval results averaged over these queries, some method of interpolation of precision values at certain preselected recall levels is needed. The currently popular approaches for handling both a weak ordering and interpolation are found to be inconsistent, and the results obtained are not easy to interpret. Moreover, in cases where some alternatives are available, no comparative analysis that would facilitate the selection of a particular strategy has been provided. In this paper, we systematically investigate the various problems and issues associated with the use of recall and precision as measures of retrieval system performance. Our motivation is to provide a comparative analysis of methods available for defining precision in a probabilistic sense and to promote a better understanding of the various issues involved in retrieval performance evaluation. © 1989, ACM.

The article reports on two studies of work at home: a quasi-experimental field study of organizational telecommuting pilot programs, and an attitude survey comparing computer professionals who work at home to employees doing similar jobs in traditional office settings. The results of the field study demonstrated that working in the home had little impact on employee performance; however, supervisors were not comfortable with remote workers and preferred their employees to be on site. In the survey, work in the home was related to lower job satisfaction, lower organizational commitment, and higher role conflict. The survey also included computer professionals who worked at home in addition to the regular work day. The author suggests that performing additional unpaid work in the home after regular work hours may be an important trend that merits further investigation. The studies demonstrate that while computer and communications technology have the potential to relax constraints on information work in terms of space and time, in today's traditional work environments, corporate culture and management style limit acceptance of telecommuting as a substitute for office work. © 1989, ACM.

Unfortunately, the signature file itself must be exhaustively searched, resulting in degraded performance for a large file size. We propose to use a deterministic algorithm to divide a signature file into partitions, each of which contains signatures with the same “key.” The signature keys in a partition can be extracted and represented as the partition's key. The search can then be confined to the subset of partitions whose keys match the query key. Our main concern here is to study methods for obtaining the keys and their performance in terms of their ability to reduce the search space. Owing to the reduction of search space, partitioning a signature file has a direct benefit in a sequential search (single-processor) environment. In a parallel environment, search can be conducted in parallel effectively by allocating one or more partitions to a processor. Partitioning the signature tile with a deterministic method (as opposed to a random partitioning scheme) provides intraquery parallelism as well as interquery parallelism. In this paper, we outline the criteria for evaluating partitioning schemes. Three algorithms are described and studied. An analytical study of the performance of the algorithms is provided and the results are verified with simulation. © 1989, ACM.

Documents are viewed as hierarchical structures; their layout (presentation) aspect is to be treated separately. The syntax and semantics of the language are defined precisely in terms of the formal model, an extended relational algebra. The proposed approach has several new features, some of which are particularly useful for the management of office information. The data model is based on nested sequences of tuples rather than nested relations. Therefore, sorting and sequence operations and the explicit handling of duplicates can be described by the model. Furthermore, this is the first model based on a many-sorted instead of a one-sorted algebra, which means that atomic data values as well as nested structures are objects of the algebra. As a consequence, arithmetic operations, aggregate functions, and so forth can be treated inside the model and need not be introduced as query language extensions to the model. Many-sorted algebra also allows arbitrary algebra expressions (with Boolean result) to be admitted as selection or join conditions and the results of arbitrary expressions to be embedded into tuples. In contrast to other formal models, this algebra can be used directly as a rich query language for office documents with precisely defined semantics. © 1989, ACM.

A study was conducted on information retrieval using a commercial hypertext-based help system. It was found that the predominant search strategy was “browsing” (characterized by scanning tables of contents and paging through topics), rather than employing the indexes (“analytical search”). Although subjects did not get lost, individuals with better spatial visualization skills, as measured by a standardized test, were faster at retrieving information and returned to the top of the information hierarchy less often than those with poorer spatial visualization skills. These results support previous studies that have found a strong preference by users for browsing in hypertext systems and extend those findings to a new domain (help), a different type of user interface, and a different information architecture. In addition, the results demonstrate the importance of spatial visualization ability for efficient navigation and information retrieval in a hierarchical hypertext system. © 1989, ACM.

This article describes a system called VAGUE that can handle vague queries directly. The principal concept behind VAGUE is its extension to the relational data model with data metrics, which are definitions of distances between values of the same domain.

These tools provide a central repository for design knowledge that otherwise would not be easily shared among users. The AI knowledge representation technology upon which the tools are founded is first described. A knowledge-based approach to interface construction is discussed, and how that approach applies to detecting design conflicts and inconsistencies stemming from two different kinds of team communication failure is illustrated. Next, a knowledge acquisition aid that is utilized within the interface construction paradigm and that also illustrates the same approach to supporting cooperative work is described. Finally, four sources of difficulty in team design efforts, which this approach seeks to address, are reviewed. © 1988, ACM.

The key factors in the Web View's success are a display that combines a record of the user's path through the network with a map of the currently available links; a scope line that summarizes the number of documents and links in the network; and a set of commands that permit the user to open documents directly from the Web View. © 1989, ACM.

Successive versions of SuperBook were evaluated in a series of behavioral studies. Students searched for information in a statistics text. presented either in conventional printed form or in SuperBook form. The best version of SuperBook enabled students to answer search questions more quickly and accurately than they could with the conventional text. Students wrote higher quality “open-book” essays using SuperBook than they did with the conventional text, and their subjective ratings of the documentation strongly favored SuperBook. This work is a case study of formative design-evaluation. Behavioral evaluation of the first version of SuperBook showed how design factors and user strategies affected search and established baseline performance measures with printed text. The second version of SuperBook was implemented with the goal of improving search accuracy and speed. User strategies that had proved effective in the first study were made very easy and attractive to use. System response time for common operations was greatly improved. Behavioral evaluation of the new SuperBook demonstrated its superiority to printed text and suggested additional improvements that were incorporated into “MiteyBook,” a SuperBook implementation for PC-size screens.

By defining and modifying templates for various semistructured objects, users can represent information about people, tasks, products, messages, and many other kinds of information in a form that can be processed intelligently by both people and their computers. By collecting these objects in customizable folders, users can create their own displays which summarize selected information from the objects in table or tree formats. Finally, by creating semiautonomous agents, users can specify rules for automatically processing this information in different ways at different times. The combination of these primitives provides a single consistent interface that integrates facilities for object-oriented databases, hypertext, electronic messaging, and rule-based intelligent agents. To illustrate the power of this combined approach, we describe several simple examples of applications (such as task tracking, intelligent message routing, and database retrieval) that we have developed in this framework. © 1988, ACM.

Work Group Structures and Computer Support: A Field Experiment,1988,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024091059&doi=10.1145%2f58566.58568&partnerID=40&md5=c1052680f1c8b99b2b1d5ae73b07a40f,"It is frequently suggested that work groups that have computer technology to support activities such as text editing, data manipulation, and communication develop systematically different structures and working processes from groups that rely on more conventional technologies such as memos, phone calls, and meetings. However, cross-sectional or retrospective research designs do not allow this hypothesis to be tested with much power. This field experiment created two task forces, each composed equally of recently retired employees and employees still at work but eligible to retire. They were given the identical tasks of preparing reports for their company on retirement planning issues, but they were randomly assigned to different technology conditions. One group had full conventional office support; the other had, in addition, networked microcomputers with electronic mail and routine office software. Structured interviews were conducted four times during the year-long project; in addition, electronic mail activity was logged in the on-line group. Although both groups produced effective reports, the two differed significantly in the kind of work they produced, the group structures that emerged, and evaluations of their own performance. Although the standard group was largely dominated by the employees through the extensive reliance on informal meetings, the electronic technology used by the other task force allowed the retirees to exercise primary leverage. We conclude that use of computer support for cooperative work results in both quantitative and qualitative changes but that effective participation in such electronically supported groups requires significant investments of time and energy on the part of its members to master the technology and a relatively high level of assistance during the learning process. © 1988, ACM.

Diversity in the Use of Electronic Mail: A Preliminary Inquiry,1988,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024088288&doi=10.1145%2f58566.58567&partnerID=40&md5=ec154e549d8801700597d76f8577c97a,"This paper describes a series of interviews that examine the ways that professional office workers use electronic mail to manage their daily work. The purpose is to generate hypotheses for future research. A number of implications for the design of flexible mail systems are discussed. Two principal claims are made. First, the use of electronic mail is strikingly diverse, although not infinitely so. Individuals vary both in objective measures of mail use and in preferred strategies for managing work electronically. Feelings of control are similarly diverse and are related to the size of the user's inbox, numbers of folders, and subscriptions to distribution lists. This diversity implies that one's own experiences with electronic mail are unlikely to provide sufficient understanding of other's uses of mail. Mail designers should thus seek flexible primitives that capture the important dimensions of use and provide flexibility for a wide range of users. The second claim is that electronic mail is more than just a communication system. Users archive messages for subject retrieval, prioritize messages to sequence work activities, and delegate tasks via mail. A taxonomy of work management is proposed in which mail is used for information management, time management, and task management activities. Directions for future research are suggested. © 1988, ACM.

Greater accessibility resulted in more usage and reported increases in effectiveness. Physical distance to a terminal affects the associations of other aspects of accessibility with usage and has a greater influence on these associations earlier in one's adoption process. Differences in job type showed statistically significant associations with usage, independent of the influence of accessibility. Computer-monitored and reported usage measures were only moderately correlated and were differentially associated with the access measures and with the two outcomes.

In this paper techniques are described for implementing probabilistic ranking strategies with sequential and bit-sliced signature tiles and the limitations of these implementations with regard to their effectiveness are pointed out. A detailed comparison is made between signature-based ranking techniques and ranking using term-based document representatives and inverted files.

Although participants were quite confident that their spreadsheets were accurate, 44 percent of the spreadsheets contained user-generated programming errors. With regard to the spreadsheet creation process, we found that experienced spreadsheet users spend a large percentage of their time using the cursor keys, primarily for the purpose of moving the cursor around the spreadsheet. Users did not spend a lot of time planning before launching into spreadsheet creation, nor did they spend much time in a separate, systematic debugging stage. Participants spent 21 percent of their time pausing, presumably reading and/or thinking, prior to the initial keystrokes of spreadsheet creation episodes. © 1987, ACM.

Description and performance analysis of signature file methods for office filing,1987,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023385618&doi=10.1145%2f27641.28057&partnerID=40&md5=2e55af1e7ab2d34ae488bb41e08ef122,"Signature files have attracted a lot of interest as an access method for text and specifically for messages in the office environment. Messages are stored sequentially in the message file, whereas their hash-coded abstractions (signatures) are stored sequentially in the signature file. To answer a query, the signature file is examined first, and many nonqualifying messages are immediately rejected. In this paper we examine the problem of designing signature extraction methods and studying their performance. We describe two old methods, generalize another one, and propose a new method and its variation. We provide exact and approximate formulas for the dependency between the false drop probability and the signature size for all the methods, and we show that the proposed method (VBC) achieves approximately ten times smaller false drop probability than the old methods, whereas it is well suited for collections of documents with variable document sizes. © 1987, ACM.

Semistructured Messages are Surprisingly Useful for Computer-Supported Coordination,1987,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023325205&doi=10.1145%2f27636.27637&partnerID=40&md5=a57b8a1700af6d0a4f83a3ee82191215,"This paper argues that using a set of semistructured message templates is surprisingly helpful in designing a variety of computer-based communication and coordination systems. Semistructured messages can help provide automatic aids for (1) composing messages to be sent, (2) selecting, sorting, and prioritizing messages that are received, (3) responding automatically to some messages, and (4) suggesting likely responses to other messages. The use of these capabilities is illustrated in a range of applications including electronic mail, computer conferencing, calendar management, and task tracking. The applications show how ideas from artificial intelligence (such as inheritance and production rules) and ideas from user interface design (such as interactive graphical editors) can be combined in novel ways for dealing with semistructured messages.

The ORION data model consolidates and modifies a number of major concepts found in many object-oriented systems, such as objects, classes, class lattice, methods, and inheritance. These concepts are reviewed and three major enhancements to the conventional object-oriented data model, namely, schema evolution, composite objects, and versions, are elaborated upon. Schema evolution is the ability to dynamically make changes to the class definitions and the structure of the class lattice. Composite objects are recursive collections of exclusive components that are treated as units of storage, retrieval, and integrity enforcement. Versions are variations of the same object that are related by the history of their derivation. These enhancements are strongly motivated by the data management requirements of the ORION applications from the domains of artificial intelligence, computer-aided design and manufacturing, and office information systems with multimedia documents. © 1987, ACM.

In this paper, we identify its underlying economic model, including five critical assumptions. We find that the model, though somewhat restrictive, is not unreasonable. However, we find that the time-saving-times-salary calculation, per se, is implicitly based on a very particular assumption about how saved time will be used. This assumption has neither a behavioral nor normative basis, and we conclude that the TSTS calculation is not meaningful in most cases. An alternate approach, the hedonic wage model, is proposed. This model overcomes most of the deficiencies of the TSTS approach, although it has somewhat greater data requirements and computational complexity. A case study illustrating the use of the hedonic wage model is presented. © 1987, ACM.

Before these new servers can enhance the productivity of application designers, systems designers must provide simple interfaces to them from both procedural and object-oriented languages. This paper first describes a successful interface between an object server and two procedural languages (C and Pascal). Because C and Pascal do not support the object-oriented paradigm application, designers using these languages must deal with database objects in less than natural ways. Fortunately, workstations supporting object-oriented languages have the potential for interacting with database objects in a much more integrated manner. To integrate these object-oriented workstations with an object server, we provide a design framework based on the notion of workstation agent objects representing principal objects in the database. We distinguish two types of agents: proxies, which forward most messages to the principal objects, and deputies, which can cache state for their principal and act with more autonomy. The interaction of cache, transaction, and message management strategies makes the implementation of deputies a nontrivial problem.

In its strictest interpretation, it means that everyone can also see the same written information and also see where anyone else is pointing. In our attempts to build software support for collaboration in meetings, we have discovered that WYSIWIS is crucial, yet too inflexible when strictly enforced. This paper is about the design issues and choices that arose in our first generation of meeting tools based on WYSIWIS. Several examples of multiuser interfaces that start from this abstraction are presented. These tools illustrate that there are inherent conflicts between the needs of a group and the needs of individuals, since user interfaces compete for the same display space and meeting time. To help minimize the effect of these conflicts, constraints were relaxed along four key dimensions of WYSIWIS: display space, time of display, subgroup population, and congruence of view. Meeting tools must be designed to support the changing needs of information sharing during process transitions, as subgroups are formed and dissolved, as individuals shift their focus of activity, and as the group shifts from multiple parallel activities to a single focused activity and back again. © 1987, ACM.

These queries reflect the presuppositions of their authors about the system and the information it contains. With most query processors, queries that are based on erroneous presuppositions often result in null answers. These fake nulls are misleading, since they do not point out the user's erroneous presuppositions (and can even be interpreted as their affirmation). This article describes the SEAVE mechanism for extracting presuppositions from queries and verifying their correctness. The verification is done against three repositories of information: the actual data, their integrity constraints, and their completeness assertions. Consequently, queries that reflect erroneous presuppositions are answered with informative messages instead of null answers, and user-system communication is thus improved (an aspect that is particularly important in systems that often are accessed by naive users). First, the principles of SEAVE are described abstractly. Then, specific algorithms for implementing it with relational databases are presented, including a new method for storing knowledge and an efficient algorithm for processing queries against the knowledge. © 1986, ACM.

Many definitions for names, addresses, and routes have been proposed, but the exact relations among these concepts are obscure. A taxonomy of names, addresses, and routes is presented. First, we identify names and routes as the essential concepts of communication. Then, addresses are introduced as an intermediate form that eases the process of mapping between names and routes; an original definition of an address is thus proposed. Relations among names, addresses, and routes are explained with the concept of mapping. On this basis, a general model relating names, addresses, and routes is built and then applied recursively throughout a layered architecture, leading to a layered naming and addressing model which may play the same role for naming and addressing features that the OS1 reference model plays for the definition of services and protocols. Finally, the model is particularized to a typical network architecture. The model may also be applied to non-OSI layered systems; naming, addressing, and routing issues in any network architecture could be a particular instance of this layered model. © 1986, ACM.

A series of version control support tools have been added to ISIS to provide a notion of history to user-created databases. The user can form new versions of three types of ISIS objects: a class definition object (a type), the set of instances of a class (the content), and an entity. A version-viewing mechanism is provided to allow for the comparison of various object versions.

Changing patterns of task organization and alliance inevitably give rise to inconsistent knowledge bases and procedures. This implies that there are no globally correct answers to problems addressed by OISs. Rather, systems must deal with multiple competing, possibly irreconcilable, solutions. Articulating alternative solutions is the problem of due process. This problem and its consequences are illustrated by a case study of a rate-setting group in a large health insurance firm. There is no formal solution to the problem of due process. But it must be solved in practice if distributed intelligent OISs are to be developed. We propose an alternative approach based on the work of social scientists concerned with analyzing analogous problems in human organization. Solution of the due process problem hinges on developing local closures to the problem faced by an organization. This means analyzing (a) local, tacit knowledge and its transfer ability; (b) articulation work, that is, reconciling incommensurate assumptions and procedures. © 1986, ACM. All rights reserved.",,

One of the most important functions of a GDSS is to provide problem-oriented services for communication among decision makers. On the basis of an analysis of the communication requirements in various group decision settings, this paper presents an architecture for defining and enforcing dynamic application-level protocols that organize decision group interaction.

In this paper, we will present a model that supports office problem solving in a logically distributed environment.

The term, logically, is therefore used to indicate the logical need of organizing information without having to worry about the physical location of the information.)

Most descriptive studies of the office have placed great emphasis on manifest office actions, suggesting that offices are the embodiment of these actions. The meanings of these actions or tasks, however, have been given scant attention. There exist a number of office activity or task taxonomies, but they do little more than provide a simple and limited structure through which to conceive of an office. From a social-analytic perspective this appears to be overly simplistic and misses the richness of social action in an office. Focusing on the overt and manifest aspects of the office may very well lead to its misrepresentation.

A Society Model for Office Information Systems,1986,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976661273&doi=10.1145%2f6168.6170&partnerID=40&md5=b0d9eb8c3021cff4d7f7718e87e2d817,"A society model, which characterizes the behavior and procedure of offices, is proposed. It is our belief that an office system capable of dealing with all real office problems only through the modeling of the internal behavior of an office can be developed. In this society model, office entities are viewed as agents. An agent is modeled as a microsociety of interacting knowledge sources. Within the microsociety, there exists a microknowledge exchange system, which provides a set of microknowledge exchange protocols as a coordination system among those knowledge sources during their cooperative reasoning process. An office is then modeled as a society of various interacting agents using their knowledge to complete the office goals cooperatively. It is this unified view that allows offices to be modeled in a flexible and general way. © 1986, ACM.

Baroque: A Browser for Relational Databases,1986,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976804076&doi=10.1145%2f6168.6172&partnerID=40&md5=3450f85f854d4d459008a5675baa6c2a,"The standard, most efficient method to retrieve information from databases can be described as systematic retrieval: The needs of the user are described in a formal query, and the database management system retrieves the data promptly. There are several situations, however, in which systematic retrieval is difficult or even impossible. In such situations exploratory search (browsing) is a helpful alternative. This paper describes a new user interface, called BAROQUE, that implements exploratory searches in relational databases. BAROQUE requires few formal skills from its users. It does not assume knowledge of the principles of the relational data model or familiarity with the organization of the particular database being accessed. It is especially helpful when retrieval targets are vague or cannot be specified satisfactorily. BAROQUE establishes a view of the relational database that resembles a semantic network, and provides several intuitive functions for scanning it. The network integrates both schema and data, and supports access by value. BAROQUE can be implemented on top of any basic relational database management system but can be modified to take advantage of additional capabilities and enhancements often present in relational systems. © 1986, ACM.

DITROFF/FFORTID permits formatting of text involving a mixture of languages written from left to right and from right to left, such as English and Hebrew. The programs are table driven or macro-generated to permit them to be used for any languages written from left to right and from right to left so long as fonts with the proper character sets can be mounted on a typesetting device supported by DITROFF. The preprocessors are set up to permit phonetic, unidirectional input of all of the alphabets needed using only the two alphabets (each case counts as an alphabet) available on the input device. These macro-generated preprocessors can be adjusted to the user's pronunciation, the language's rules about a letter's form, depending on its position in the word, and the language of the user's input keyboard. The postprocessor is set up to properly change direction of formatting when the text switches to a language written in a different direction. The collection of programs is also designed to allow use of any of DITROFF's preprocessors, such as PIC, EQN, TBL, and the various device drivers. © 1985, ACM. All rights reserved.",,

Office information systems provide a particularly appropriate context for this type of information sharing and exchange. A federated database architecture is described in which a collection of independent database systems are united into a loosely coupled federation in order to share and exchange information. A federation consists of components (of which there may be any number) and a single federal dictionary. The components represent individual users, applications, workstations, or other components in an office information system. The federal dictionary is a specialized component that maintains the topology of the federation and oversees the entry of new components. Each component in the federation controls its interactions with other components by means of an export schema and an import schema. The export schema specifies the information that a component will share with other components, while the import schema specifies the nonlocal information that a component wishes to manipulate. The federated architecture provides mechanisms for sharing data, for sharing transactions (via message types) for combining information from several components, and for coordinating activities among autonomous components (via negotiation). A prototype implementation of the federated database mechanism is currently operational on an experimental basis. © 1985, ACM. All rights reserved.",,

Paper documents are scanned and digitized at a scan density of 200 picture elements (pels) per inch by either a high-speed loose-leaf scanner with an automatic document transport or a book scanner with a manual book holder. Each scanner employs a high-resolution charge-coupled device (CCD) linear array operating at a sampling rate close to 10 MHz. The analog output signal of the CCD array is digitized into 1 bit per pixel two-tone images by means of dynamic thresholding. The digitized images are stored on magnetic disks to be processed and will eventually be transferred onto optical disks for archival storage. Existing on-line bibliographic databases developed by the National Library of Medicine are used as directories for the retrieval of document images. These images are displayed at a resolution of 200 pels/inch in both soft-copy (raster-refreshed CRT) and hard-copy forms. This prototype system, developed as part of a research and development program, offers the opportunity to investigate the areas of document image enhancement, image compression, and omnifont text recognition and to conduct experiments designed to answer key questions on the role of electronic document storage and retrieval technology in library information processing and the preservation of library documents. © 1985, ACM.

The standard name-based approach to object reference is now supplemented on some systems by a spatial alternative-often driven by an office or desktop metaphor. Little rigorous evidence is available, however, to support the supposition that spatial memory in itself is more effective than symbolic memory. The accuracy of spatial versus symbolic reference was assessed in three experiments. In Experiment 1 accuracy of location reference in a location-only filing condition was initially comparable to that in a name-only condition, but deteriorated much more rapidly with increases in the number of objects filed. In Experiment 2 subjects placed objects in a two-dimensional space containing landmarks (drawings of a desk, table, filing cabinets, etc.) designed to evoke an office metaphor, and in Experiment 3 subjects placed objects in an actual, three-dimensional mock office. Neither of these enhancements served to improve significantly the accuracy of location reference, and performance remained below that of a name-only condition in Experiment 1. The results raise questions about the utility of spatial metaphor over symbolic filing and highlight the need for continuing research in which considerations of technological and economic feasibility are balanced by considerations of psychological utility. © 1986, ACM.

We first discuss message addressing schemes, which are a framework for dealing with the naming and addressing problem. Message addressing schemes can also serve as a basis for the analysis of some of the properties of logical message routing within a system. We examine the conditions necessary for a complete message addressing scheme, that is, one that guarantees to deliver all possible messages. © 1986, ACM.

A natural language system can be “transportable” in a number of ways. Although transportability to a new domain is most prominent, other ways are also important if the system is to have viability in the commercial marketplace. On the one hand, transporting a system to a new domain may start with the system prior to adding any domain of knowledge and extend it to incorporate the new domain. On the other hand, one may wish to add to a system that already has knowledge of one domain the knowledge concerning a second domain, that is, to extend the system to cover this second domain. In the context of ASK, it has been natural to implement extending and then achieve transportability as a special case. In this paper, we consider six ways in which the ASK System can be extended to include new capabilities: to a new domain, to a new object type, to access data from a foreign database, to a new natural language, to a new programming language, to a new computer family. Special-purpose applications, such as those to accommodate standard office tasks, would make use of these various means of extension. © 1985, ACM. All rights reserved.",,

These speeds occur when a user continuously holds down an arrow key to move the cursor more than one character position (i.e., in repeat or typamatic mode). Results show that cursor speed did not seem to act as a pacing device for the entire editing task. Since cursor speed is a form of system response, this finding is in contrast with the generally found positive relation between system-response time and user-response time. Participants preferred the Fast cursor speed, however. Overall, more than one-third of all keystrokes were used to move the cursor. We estimate that 9-14 percent of editing time was spent controlling and moving the cursor, regardless of cursor speed. © 1985, ACM. All rights reserved.",,

Transportable Natural Language Processing Through Simplicity—The PRE System,1985,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976817435&doi=10.1145%2f3914.3985&partnerID=40&md5=d02cf53da1bbc7ec0f1856ae6cf828b9,"PRE (Purposefully Restricted English) is a restricted English database query language whose implementation has addressed engineering goals, namely, habitability, interapplication transportability, performance, and use with a reliable database management system that supports large numbers of concurrent users and large databases. Habitability has not been demonstrated, but initial indications are encouraging. The other goals have clearly been achieved. The existence of the PRE system demonstrates that an explicitly “minimalist” approach to natural language processing can facilitate achievement of transportability. © 1985, ACM.

While electronic messaging and videotape were not found to improve significantly over print either the recall of information or the quality of decisions made based on it, some interesting patterns were observed. The use of electronic messaging resulted in improved recall of information. Videotape tended toward the extremes: It was either the most or the least effective in disseminating information for learning. Subjects' attitudes about the influence of each channel on the quality of information were contrasted with the disposition toward use. In general, subjects had positive attitudes toward both electronic messaging and videotape. When asked about the likelihood of choosing a particular channel, given emphasis on certain information attributes, however, subjects consistently. preferred print. These results suggest that both the communication context and user preconceptions must be taken into account when planning for the introduction of new technologies. © 1984, ACM.

Some office tasks are readily implemented with generic office tools, such as calendars, forms packages, and mail. Many tasks, however, involve complex sequences of actions which do not all correspond to tool invocations but, instead, rely on the problem-solving abilities of office workers. In this paper we describe a system (POISE) than can be used to both automate routine tasks and provide assistance in more complex situations. The type of assistance provided can range from maintaining a record of the tasks currently being executed to suggesting possible next steps and answering natural language queries about the tasks. The POISE system uses both a procedure-based and a goal-based representation of the tasks to achieve efficiency and flexibility. The mechanisms used by POISE are described with example procedures from a university office. © 1984, ACM. All rights reserved.",Natural language; problem-solving; tools,

The main ideas in OPAL are described, including novel data types, partitioned work spaces, object version management, multiple property inheritance, and incremental application development. A scheme for naming objects is proposed and discussed. There are basically two large advantages to such a scheme--a very practical shorthand for referring to objects and a means for structuring information according to criteria not represented in the objects themselves. The latter property also supports viewing objects in different roles. Furthermore, the scheme is used to structure the whole object management system. © 1984, ACM.

The underlying dimensions of information accessibility, however, have not been investigated empirically. The present field study measures end-user perceptions of three online information retrieval systems and one electronic mail system. User ratings of the four systems are collected and factor-analyzed. The results suggest that (1)physical access to a terminal and access to the actual information system are independent dimensions, (2) that accessibility is a multidimensional concept encompassing physical access to a terminal and the system, the command language, and the ability to retrieve the desired information successfully, and (3) that perceptions of accessibility are a function of prior user experience with online systems. In order to facilitate the acceptance of office information systems, organizations need to provide extensive support and training when the system is introduced, as well as ready physical access to the system over the course of its useful life. © 1984, ACM.

Our interest is in adapting and extending techniques developed for these systems, especially those used in database query systems and our own English-language programming language system (NLC), for use in office environments. This paper describes the Layered Domain Class system (LDC), a state-of-the-art natural language processor whose major goals are (1) to provide English-language retrieval capabilities for mediumsized office domains that have been stored on the computer as text-edited files, as opposed to more restrictive database structures; and (2) to eliminate the need to call in the system designer when extensions into new domains are desired, without sacrificing the depth or reliability of the interface. In this paper we (a) provide an overview of LDC, including sample inputs; (b) briefly discuss the role of each module of the system, with special attention to provisions for users to adapt the system to deal with new types of data; and (c) consider the relation of our system to other formal and natural language interfaces that are in use or under development. © 1984, ACM.

Input language is processed by a simple, nonparsing algorithm with limited storage requirements and a quick response time. CAL allows unconstrained English inputs from users with no training (except for a five minute introduction to the keyboard and display) and no manual (except for a two-page overview of the system). In a controlled test of performance, CAL correctly responded to between 86 percent and 97 percent of the storage and retrieval requests it received, according to various criteria. This level of performance could never have been achieved with such a simple processing model were it not for the empirical approach used in the development of the program and its dictionaries. The tools of the engineering psychologist are clearly invaluable in the development of user-friendly software, if that software is to accommodate the unruly language of computer-naive, first-time users. The key is to elicit the cooperation of such users as partners in an iterative, empirical development process. © 1984, ACM.

Users' most frequent commands were those that performed editing-like functions on text and other objects (e.g., UNIX directories), those that returned orienting information to users, and those that helped to control and sequence other commands. People made mistakes frequently, and made them most, when they needed information about the command and file context in which they were working, and when they had to plan long sequences of commands without feedback.

Using and extending ideas from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) we describe office work as a problem-solving activity. A knowledgeembedding language called OMEGA is used to embed knowledge of the organization into an office worker's work station in order to support the office worker in problem solving. A particular approach to reasoning about change and contradiction is discussed. This approach uses OMEGA's viewpoint mechanism, which is a general contradiction-handling facility. Unlike other knowledge representation systems, when a contradiction is reached the reasons for the contradiction can be analyzed by the deduction mechanism without having to resort to search mechanisms such as a backtracking. The viewpoint mechanism is the heart of the problem-solving support paradigm, a paradigm which supplements the classical AI view of problem solving. An example is presented in which OMEGA's facilities are used to support an office worker's problem-solving activities.

A number of implications for designing “natural” and convenient computer-based information systems are discussed. Two principal claims are made: (1) A very important function of desk organization is to remind the user of things to do, not just to help the user find desired information. Failing to support this function may seriously impair the usefulness of electronic office systems, and explicitly facilitating it may provide an important advantage for automated office systems over their nonautomated predecessors. (2) The cognitive difficulty of categorizing information is an important factor in explaining how people organize their desks. Computer-based systems may help with this difficulty by (a) doing as much automatic classification as possible (e.g., based on access dates), and (b) including untitled “piles” of information arranged by physical location as well as explicitly titled and logically arranged “files.” Several other implications for the design of electronic office systems are discussed, and some differences in how people organize their desks are described. © 1983, ACM.

Details of command-language keystrokes,1983,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976794415&doi=10.1145%2f357431.357434&partnerID=40&md5=9669cfe437843e3b11f806ce2eadad93,"The Keystroke-Level Model asserts that the time for an expert to enter a task using a command language is a function of specific task-acquisition, mental, and motor-response times. The evidence for the model is critically reviewed, and new data are presented. The fit of the new data to the model is modest even when several modifications of the model are considered. It is proposed that a more complex model, based explicitly on cognitive processes, is necessary. © 1983, ACM. All rights reserved.",cognitive psychology; User interface,
The Design of Star's Records Processing: Data Processing for the Noncomputer Professional,1983,ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939005290&doi=10.1145%2f357423.357425&partnerID=40&md5=94c8685f436be8d32e1799d92a5aaa8b,"Xerox's Star Professional Workstation is distinguished by a graphic user interface committed to the “what-you-see-is-what-you-get” design philosophy. The system promotes a see/point/push-a-button style of interaction with immediate feedback, in marked contrast to more familiar programming or command language interfaces. Star's records processing feature integrates traditional data processing functionality into this user model, using standard Star documents for data demition, entry, display, update, and report generation. Benefits include an economy of concepts and effort for user and implementor alike, along with the synergy of a unified environment. © 1983, ACM.

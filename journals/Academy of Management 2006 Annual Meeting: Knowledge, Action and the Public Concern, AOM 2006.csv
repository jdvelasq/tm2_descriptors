Building competitive advantage: The roles of upper echelons and competitive aggressiveness,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863339690&partnerID=40&md5=a79948ed4408491976db1e637f6d4e28,"Basing hypotheses on competitive dynamics, upper echelons, and power perspectives, this study examines top management team (TMT) social integration and competitive aggressiveness as sources of competitive advantage. The impact of CEO power dominance on TMT social integration and organizational outcomes were explored as well. Structural equation modeling analyses show significant supports to the research model and the hypothesized relationships. TMT Social integration and action aggressiveness indeed advance a firm's financial performance, while CEO power dominance demonstrates negative influences on TMT social integration and competitive aggressiveness. Although dominance might bring positively direct effects on financial outcome; however, when considering the indirect effects, power dominance shows a negative impact on firm performance as a whole. Moreover, TMT exhibits a more overwhelming impact on competitive aggressiveness and firm performance than CEO did. This study contributes to the resource-based view by identifying a bundle of strategic assets that are critical in promoting competitive advantage. Since this study examines the black box of TMT processes, incorporates strategic competitive behavior into the relationship of TMT and firm performance, and investigates the impact of CEO on TMT interactions, findings in this study also advance the theoretical implications of the upper echelon perspective. Moreover, competitive dynamics perspective is advanced through the examinations of the effects of human factors on competitive rivalry and the collections of large-scale multi-industry sample with survey method. Implications for business practices and future directions are discussed.

Firm-specific innovations and rent appropriation: Tests of contingencies,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84889709248&partnerID=40&md5=2b91c3d7995832fb47b90e780347af9b,"Should firms commit in developing firm-specific innovations-innovations that are valued higher inside a firm than in the market? Departing from the existing innovation literature, this paper argues that firmspecificity in innovations may function as an effective isolating mechanism that helps firms better appropriate innovation rents. However, such an advantage may turn out to be a liability when the operational environment is fast-changing. Moreover, firms that have high levels of firm-specificity in their innovations but conduct their innovative activities in diverse technological areas are likely to prevent the potential value erosion of their firm-specific innovations due to environmental changes. Results from patent citation data of U.S. manufacturing firms support these key arguments.",Firm-specificity; Innovation; RBV,Industry; Innovation; Environmental change; Firm-specificity; Innovation rents; Innovative activities; Manufacturing firms; Operational environments; Patent citation; Potential values; RBV; Patents and inventions
For better or worse? Mergers and status outcomes in the investment banking industry,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858681594&partnerID=40&md5=d9e7b267a50e8771bd924ebbc8dcca11,"Previous studies of status dynamics show that firm performance and social factors, such as affiliations, are associated with changes in status. Inter-firm affiliations exhibit status transfer from the higher status to the lower status party; because this exchange is unavoidable industry affiliations are often characterized by status homophily. Prior research has focused on affiliations in which both firms continue to maintain independent identities in the marketplace. Relationships which constitute a combination of actors have been largely overlooked. This study explores status dynamics in the context of firm combinations, specifically intra-industry mergers. These relationships are complex because they require the integration of two distinct firms. A framework for evaluating the status outcomes of mergers is developed. Outcomes are defined along three dimensions-how the status of the post-merger firm compares to that of a given focal firm, its merger partner and the expected status outcome. Status outcomes for focal firms are hypothesized to be dependent on the firm's status position relative to its merger partner, the degree of status homophily between firms, and the firms' total status. Hypotheses are empirically tested using data from the investment banking industry during the years 1980-2000. Results provide evidence of status transfer between firms. However, unlike previous findings, status homophily is associated with worse status outcomes than is status dissimilarity between merger partners. Dyads characterized by high total status also have a negative impact on status outcomes for focal firms. These results are explained by the challenges of integration which are unique to firm combinations.",Industry networks; Mergers; Status,Dynamics; Merging; Firm Performance; Homophily; Industry networks; Investment banking; Mergers; Social factor; Status; Industry

Applying Bhabha's understanding of culture, mimicry and agency, the paper first offers a critical reading of IHRM's most fundamental concepts, namely, ""national culture"", "" pluralism"" and ""multi-culturalism"", ""transfer"", and ""cultural sensitivity"", and then attempts to propose an alternative epistemology for an analysis of the MNC as a Bhabhaian third space.",,Fundamental concepts; Human resources management; National cultures
The key role of personal values in decoupling task conflict from relationship conflict,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863391296&partnerID=40&md5=da82f6485b2370fc20e67f064b0c9df6,"Recent research suggests that task and relationship conflict are highly intercorrelated, implying a dilemma such that the associated negative effects of relationship conflict can outweigh the potential benefits of task conflict (e.g., de Dreu & Weingart, 2003). Simons and Peterson (2000) suggest, however, that trust moderates this association so that task and relationship conflict are unrelated in groups with high intragroup trust, arguing that the groups with high intragroup trust can benefit from task conflict (i.e., increased motivation, divergent thinking, and information processing) without the attendant problems of relationship conflict. We argue, and find support from a sample of 90 work teams from Taiwan, that this effect is limited in two ways. The moderating effect of trust is restricted to individuals who value: 1) selfdirection over security (individualists); and/or 2) benevolence and trust over power and achievement (those who value trust for its own sake).",Conflict; Groups; Values,Conflict; Divergent thinkings; Groups; Intra-group; Moderating effect; Peterson; Potential benefits; Relationship conflicts; Task conflicts; Values; Work team; Data processing
Gender and influence across the globe: Cross-cultural gender differences in organizational upward influence,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863362578&partnerID=40&md5=9c2b33d6fd55343aee85ad6553679b1a,"This study investigated cross-national gender differences in attitudes toward strategies of upward influence across 16 diverse countries. We used hierarchical linear modeling to test for significant economic and socio-cultural moderators on these relationships, while controlling for demographic and organizational characteristics. Overall, compared to male managers, female managers had similar views regarding the acceptability of organizationally beneficial behaviors, viewed self-indulgent behaviors as being relatively more acceptable, and viewed destructive behaviors as being relatively less acceptable. While cross-national convergence was found in respect to attitudes towards organizationally beneficial behaviors, cross-national divergence/crossvergence was indicated by the significant moderating effects of societal contextual factors on gender differences in the relative acceptability of self-indulgent and destructive behaviors. Findings are discussed in the context of cross-cultural research, including moral development, as well as implications for the role of female managers in organizational and societal contexts.",Cross-cultural; Gender differences; Upward influence,Management; Managers; Contextual factors; Cross-cultural; Cross-cultural research; Cross-national; Gender differences; Hierarchical linear modeling; Moderating effect; Moral development; Organizational characteristics; Upward influence; Behavioral research
Experience homogeneity or experience heterogeneity? A stepwise approach to acquisition capability development,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858692545&partnerID=40&md5=8cff62ed4da3d59b1b387ee18b357866,"Although organizational learning theory has traditionally argued that experience homogeneity facilitates learning, research has recently started to uncover important learning benefits of experience heterogeneity instead. Pursuing a deeper understanding of how firms can learn to be more effective at doing acquisitions, we argue, drawing on transfer theory, that each has its own distinctive strengths and that both can be beneficial to the development of acquisition capability, though at different stages in the learning process. Unlike most extant research, which lumps all acquisitions together into a single generic category, we distinguish between subcategories of horizontal, related diversified, and vertical acquisitions, each implying a different level of experience heterogeneity. Apart from helping to reconcile the inconsistent results uncovered in the literature so far, these subcategories enable us to formulate and test a dynamic framework of hypotheses that provide insight into the actual process of how firms can best develop acquisition capability. We test this framework using a multi-industry sample of firms over a period of more than three decades and find strong support for it. A key finding is that the experience homogeneity resulting from undertaking horizontal acquisitions can serve as a springboard toward developing a more widely applicable acquisition capability, enabling the firm to subsequently capitalize on the inherent strengths of experience heterogeneity.",Acquisition capability; Experience heterogeneity; Organizational learning,Knowledge management; Acquisition capability; Dynamic framework; Experience heterogeneity; Learning process; Organizational learning; Stepwise approach; Mergers and acquisitions

A post-hoc analysis suggests that in the special context of post-Sep 11th international business environment, international diversity does not illustrate a curvilinear relationship with MNEs' performance as prior studies have predicted.

In contrast to frequency- and trait-based imitation, this study emphasizes how firms respond when observing negative outcomes of peer firms, and how causal ambiguity moderates this failure-induced learning. Two key findings emerge from our analysis of market entries into China by Japanese multinationals from 1980 to 2000. First, firms are less likely to enter the market when observing a large number of failures by others. Second, the causal ambiguity for prior failures weakens the effect of other firms' failures. The results highlight the importance of considering causal ambiguity in failure-induced learning.",Causal ambiguity; Failure-induced learning; Foreign market entry,Commerce; Causal ambiguity; Failure-induced learning; Foreign markets; Market entry; Organizational learning; Strategic choice; Industry
Organizational initial categorization: Imprinting and the mitigation of imprinting,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858681544&partnerID=40&md5=5a328fcd739ce96239b0dc070e9d2d8c,"Despite continuous research on the imprinting effect of objective founding conditions, existing research pay little attention to how external audiences' first impression of an organization at founding has imprinting effect over its life time. This paper is premised on the observation that newly founded organizations face the challenge of premature categorization. When faced with a new organization whose quality and other attributes are uncertain, external audiences are likely to adopt the cognitive shortcut of quickly categorizing based on salient characteristics and then attributing category characteristics to the new organization. Self-fulfilling processes tend to perpetuate the initial categorization, which as a result tends to imprint the organization. The imprinting effect of initial categorization is likely stronger when the organization is founded in a field with higher uncertainty. Moreover, we hypothesize that the imprinting effect of initial categorization may be mitigated by subsequent organizational performance, name change, location change and external relationship change. Our empirical analysis in the field of American college football major bowls from 1902 to 2004 yields strong support for our theory. This study makes important contributions to several lines of research.",Identity; Imprinting; Initial categorization,Empirical analysis; Identity; Imprinting; Initial categorization; Life-times; Organizational performance; Research
Stock market reactions to knowledge-motivated acquisitions,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858684415&partnerID=40&md5=782261425075a6393f547ebfd11d38c7,"While resource-based theory and the business press both suggest that the stock market should reward acquirers who purchase targets with more flexible, hard-to-imitate knowledge resources, few empirical studies to date have explored this hypothesis, with mixed results. This study uses a new, fine-grained, firm-based measure of target resources to investigate the relationship between target resource type and acquirer stock market performance. Our findings suggest that the market punishes acquirers of knowledge-based resources more than those that buy property-based resources due to the perceived uncertainty regarding the value of targets' knowledge resources. In support of the underlying uncertainty argument, we find that managers announcing knowledge-based mergers provide more information in their press releases than those announcing property-based transactions. While prior studies have suggested that resource relatedness may moderate the resource type and acquisition performance link, our findings do not support either a direct or moderating relationship. This research does not answer the question of why managers increasingly undertake knowledge-motivated acquisitions given their relatively poor performance; however, it does provide guidance to practitioners about which acquisitions are likely to outperform others and how to gain relevant information from acquirer press releases. Directions for future research are suggested, including investigating longer term performance of knowledge-motivated acquisitions as well as more in-depth investigation of managers' reasons for undertaking these underperforming, at least in the short-run, acquisition strategies.",Acquisitions; Firm performance; Knowledge resources,Commerce; Finance; Knowledge based systems; Management; Managers; Public relations; Acquisition performance; Acquisition strategies; Empirical studies; Firm Performance; In-depth investigation; Knowledge resource; Knowledge-based resources; Poor performance; Press release; Resource-based theory; Stock market; Stock market performance; Mergers and acquisitions

Although researchers have paid increasing attention to expatriate management for the past twenty five years, many gaps remain in understanding the diverse factors affecting expatriate adjustment and assignment effectiveness. One underdeveloped yet promising research area related to expatriate management is cultural intelligence (CQ), defined as a person's capability to adapt effectively to a new cultural context. Even though CQ may potentially advance expatriate research and practice in numerous ways, theoretical development of the role CQ may play in expatriate adjustment and effectiveness has been limited. Thus, in acknowledging the potential roles of CQ in a cross-cultural context, this paper theoretically explores how CQ influences expatriate adjustment and performance. Specifically, we argue that an expatriate with higher CQ may perform better in a different cultural environment. In exploring the relationship between CQ and expatriate performance, we position cross-cultural adjustment as a mediator. We also consider the potential moderating role of cultural distance in the relationship between CQ and expatriate adjustment. Lastly, we put forth several propositions regarding CQ's effect on expatriate adjustment over time in the early stage of socialization and CQ's uniqueness and predictive validity over other personality traits. We also provide an agenda for future empirical research.",Cultural intelligence; Expatriate adjustment; Expatriate performance,Competition; Research; Competitive advantage; Cultural context; Cultural environment; Cultural intelligence; Empirical research; Expatriate adjustment; Expatriate performance; Global economies; International assignments; Personality traits; Research areas; Theoretical development; Communication
Satisfaction and individual preference for structuring: What is fit depends on where you are from,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863362964&partnerID=40&md5=4a64559dcbfd78fb008203af6dc7d2d7,"Fit is usually conceived as congruence between personal preferences and environmental supplies. As fit increases so should individual satisfaction.

Using data from low power-distance European contexts (n = 111) similar to that of the U.S., we confirmed what is know in the extant literature. However, data from high power-distance European (n = 84) and Asian (n = 577) contexts indicated that these individuals were not dissatisfied when their preferences (i.e., preferences for structuring) were incongruent to environmental supplies (i.e., the extent to which they perceived the organization to be structured).

However most of this research has focused on characteristics of the individual member and the community under consideration, takeing the existence of the community as a given and giving little attention to the larger context in which the community resides. This paper extends prior research by proposing an ecological perspective when studying community success, taking into account the extent of competition created by other communities in the same niche. Analysis of a longitudinal sample of 100 Usenet newsgroups over 57 months from September 1999 to May 2004 implies that both internal characteristics and external context affect communities' capability to retain members. Specifically, the findings suggest that the average post per active participant in a community reflected the level of commitment the community gets from its members and predicted the likelihood that members will return. The total number of posts and average message length in a community represent information demand on members, and hence decreased return rate. Competition - the number of other communities that share content with a community and the extent to which the community's members also participate in other communities - represent an external threat that is found to predict a lower likelihood of members to return in the following time period.",Group competition; Group ecology; Online communities,Online systems; Research; Structural dynamics; Websites; Community IS; Information demand; Internal characteristics; Message length; Newsgroups; Online communities; Time-periods; Ecosystems

Although many prior studies have traced economic outcomes to actors?status, virtually all such investigations have limited their theoretical and empirical scope to the level of status that a focal actor occupies at a chosen time point-not taking into account as well the variability of that actor's earlier locations in the evolving status hierarchy to which it belongs. Taking as given the premise from earlier research that the current level of status positively affects future economic performance, in this article we bring into focus the consequences of an actor's earlier series of status positions in an evolving social hierarchy. We develop the dual claim that status volatility acts as a signal of an actor's underlying lack of quality and that it also degrades the signal strength of that actor's current status. We thus view a sequence of erratic movements in status as both a signal in its own right and as noise-not only indicating a lack of underlying quality but also muffling the quality-related message otherwise transmitted by an actor'scurrent standing in a status ordering. Using a twenty-year panel of data on the growth rates of firms in the venture capital industry, where size is measured as the number of target companies funded per year, we find support for our dual characterization of status volatility.",Network; Status; Venture capital,Industry; Networks (circuits); Current levels; Current status; Economic performance; Signal strengths; Social hierarchy; Status; Venture Capital; Investments

However, the expatriate literature has often emphasized the importance of adjustment to the host culture as key to intercultural effectiveness and overlooked the importance of other possible mediators of successful performance, such as the cognitive skills that develop during second-culture exposure as a result of the tensions created by trying to internalize a new culture while also maintaining the old. In this paper I attempt to address these knowledge gaps by focusing on the effects of acculturation strategy and the mediating role of integrative complexity on performance. Based on the predictions of the Acculturation Complexity Model (ACM), I suggest that biculturals will reach higher levels of integrative complexity than will assimilated and separated individuals, and that consequently they will perform better in managerial tasks, irrespective of their levels of adjustment. The advantages of complexity, however, will not generalize to technical performance. Results from a study of 100 Israelis working in the U.S. confirm these hypotheses.

By using business groups in emerging economies as the organizational lens and adopting stochastic frontier estimation to measure firm capabilities, we argue that the effect of intra-group networks on the development of the focal affiliate's capabilities is contingent upon types of network ties as well as the structure of intra-group networks in which it is embedded. We find that in loosely connected networks of operating ties and investment ties, affiliates in the central of the network are well-positioned to access new ideas, information, and resources both within and outside the group. Meanwhile, central affiliates in a loose network of director ties and peripheral affiliates in a dense network of director ties may benefit from efficient resource-sharing and internal coordination.",Business group; Capability building; Intra-group network,Economics; Stochastic systems; Business groups; Capability building; Connected networks; Emerging economies; Firm capabilities; Internal coordination; Intra-group networks; Stochastic frontier estimations; Distributed computer systems

We argue that managerial control systems affect employees' fairness concerns and lead them to place more emphasis on particular types of fairness evaluations. When managers attend appropriately to subordinates' fairness concerns, those subordinates will exhibit levels of commitment and collective esteem higher than could be achieved through the independent promotion of controls or fairness. We also observe that when managers violate the type of fairness about which subordinates are most sensitive, it results in lower levels of commitment and collective esteem than would otherwise be seen. Using a series of survey studies, we evaluate the fairness concerns of employees within market and bureaucratic managerial control systems and the effects produced when managers attend to or violate their employees' particular fairness concerns. Findings suggest that market control systems heighten subordinates' distributive and informational fairness concerns while bureaucratic control systems heighten subordinates' procedural, informational, and interpersonal fairness concerns. Findings also suggest that when subordinates perceive a match/mismatch between their fairness concerns and perceptions of fairness, they exhibit higher/lower levels of group commitment and collective esteem than they do based on the main effects produced by fairness perceptions when fairness concerns are low. These effects were only observed when managers were perceived to strongly assert controls.",Commitment; Control; Fairness,Control; Control theory; Management; Managers; Commitment; Fairness; Fairness evaluation; Main effect; Management objectives; Human resource management

However, little research on exploitation and exploration is conducted at the manufacturing plant level. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), we conceptualize exploitation and exploration as two plant level capabilities, each consisting of a bundle of interrelated yet distinct routines. We propose a second-order factor model for measuring exploitation and exploration capabilities that captures the unobservable nature of the two capabilities. We then develop a reliable and valid set of measurement for the two capabilities. Lastly, for each of exploitation and exploration capabilities, we compare two performance models: 1) a second-order performance model in which the second order factor (capability) is related to a multi-dimensional performance measure, and 2) a first-order factor performance model in which we allow each first-order factor (routine) to directly impact performance. The results suggest that the second-order factor performance model is a sufficiently close yet more parsimonious representation of the relationships between the bundle of routines and the operational performance when compared with the first-order factor performance model.",Capabilities; RBV; Routines,A plants; Capabilities; Exploitation and explorations; Factor model; First-order; Impact performance; Manufacturing plant; Operational performance; Performance measure; Performance Model; Plant level; RBV; Resource-based view; Routines; Second orders; Unobservable; Industrial research

A better understanding of which firms enter new markets and how they enter is critical in developing more sophisticated theories of innovation, new product development, and industry evolution. Theory on entry suggests two competing hypotheses for explaining the effects of capabilities on new product market entry. One hypothesis is that firms innovate and enter new product markets by conducting local searches based on their internal routines and capabilities in the surrounding product spaces. An alternative hypothesis suggests that the routines of firms become rigid over time and focusing on current product markets reduces entry and innovation. Both of these effects have been documented in the empirical literature. This paper attempts to resolve these competing hypotheses and develop a more refined theory of entry, entry mode, and entry type by constructing more detailed measures of innovation and experience. The empirical analysis involves studying all the firms in the cardiovascular medical device industry from 1976-2004. We find that firms with greater radical innovation experience are more likely to enter new markets, while firms with greater incremental innovation experience are less likely to enter. Firms are more likely to enter through acquisition when they have less radical/imitative experience and technological capabilities. Finally, firms with greater radical innovative experience are more likely to enter with radical innovation, but conditional on entry, smaller firms with less innovative experience are more likely to introduce radical innovations.",Entry; Industry evolution; Innovation,Product development; Alternative hypothesis; Empirical literature; Entry; Incremental innovation; Industry evolution; Medical device industry; New product development; Technological capability; Commerce

This study examines the impact of work-home culture on employee well-being. Specifically, it investigates whether work-home culture is capable of directly predicting employees' psychosomatic strain symptomology (e.g., fatigue, tension, anxiety, and depression), if its effect is mediated by perceived interference between work and home, or if work-home culture moderates the relationship between work-home interference and employee well-being. Sex differences in these relationships are also explored. Results from a cross-sectional analysis of data collected from 226 public sector employees in the UK suggest that the relationship between work-home culture and employee well-being is both direct and indirect for women, with both mediation and moderation taking place. Work-home culture was not significantly related to men's wellbeing.

We employ a quasi-experimental design in a formal career coaching program established to enhance business student job search skills and outcomes.

This was especially true in cooperative groups. Egocentric biases in responsibility allocation can create conflict, but this research suggests that undoing them can make matters worse.

We also hypothesize that employees' perception of contract fulfillment by the employer at time 2 will be positively associated with their performance at time 3. Finally, we hypothesize that perceived organizational support (POS) will moderate these relationships such that the relationship is stronger for individuals high on POS. Using a longitudinal survey and objective measures of performance from a sample of 153 sales advisers in the UK banking sector, our findings suggest that employee performance (sales made and sales targets met) predicts subsequent psychological contract fulfillment. Employee perceptions of employer contract fulfillment also predict their subsequent performance thus supporting hypothesis 2. However, we found weak support for the moderating role of POS in either relationship. Our findings support the norm of reciprocity as underpinning the psychological contract, irrespective of which party starts the cycle of bestowing benefits. They also support the utility of the psychological contract in terms of predicting actual workplace behavior, supplementing previous research that has largely focused in using the psychological contract to explain attitudes and self-report behaviors.",,Knowledge management; Banking sectors; Employee perceptions; Employee performance; Objective measure; Organizational support; Psychological contracts; Sales targets; Personnel rating

While internalization theory and other explanations have been advanced to explain why cross-border acquisitions may create more value than purely domestic acquisitions, they cannot explain why acquirers should be able to capture this value rather than having to surrender it to targets as they would in domestic transactions. I propose to solve the puzzles presented by the returns to cross-border acquisitions using two familiar concepts combined in a novel way: first, the scarcity of foreign market knowledge, and second, the ability of social networks to transmit knowledge. The scarcity of market knowledge creates an obstacle to cross-border transactions that MNCs with the appropriate network ties can exploit to earn above normal returns on their acquisitions. I use event study and fixed-effects regression methods to show that MNCs with subsidiary networks configured to span weak ties in the global network can earn above normal returns on their cross-border acquisitions.

Using a survey-generated sample of 252 entrepreneurial firms, this study analyzes the linkages of manage-ment activities, market orientation, and performance in these firms. Findings suggest that the management approach in place exerts a strong influence on the level of market orientation of an entrepreneurial firm and thereby, also on performance.

To date this topic has tended to fall into two categories; a cognitive psychology approach, which tends to conceptualise humor as a means to reach a certain end in the organization and poststructuralist approaches, whose empirical concerns frequently center on control- resistance relationships between managers and workers. In a novel attempt to broaden and extend these views of organizational humor, the work of Judith Butler is presented along with empirical illustrations from in-depth research in an online advertising agency, in which the majority of humor was 'performed' on group email lists. While Butler's work focuses mainly on issues of gender identity, we find that a reading of her concept of 'performativity', the means by which social norms as continually enacted over time, provides us with a useful lens for understanding organizational humor. This Butlerian reading renders the concept of humor more open than previous studies have shown; humor can have all the functions described by cognitive psychologist approaches, it can play a role in the dynamics of organizational control-resistance relationships as described by the poststructuralist authors, but it is not restricted to these interpretations. In addition, this performative approach to organizational humor implies that humor be seen as something that is necessarily always moving and changing, since every performance, or re-enactment of social norms, involves an aspect of chance and is thus indeterminate.",,Marketing; Advertising agency; Cognitive psychology; Online advertising; Organizational controls; Performativity; Social norm; Human resource management

We situate our analysis in the Hollywood motion picture industry and trace the vital rates of movie production companies over the period 1912-1970.

Specifically, we argue that such regulatory foci on economic and social gains may coexist and reinforce rather than preclude each other. We test hypotheses developed from this argument in a study of survey data on hospital adoption of Total Quality Management (TQM) programs, an administrative innovation that diffused in the 1990s. Results support our argument that an interest in appearing legitimate (""looking good"") can coexist with a motivation to pursue genuine performance improvement (""doing better"").",Adoption motivation; Diffusion of innovations; Institutional theory,Decision making; Decision theory; Total quality management; Administrative innovation; Adoption motivations; Decision makers; Diffusion of innovations; Institutional theory; Neo-institutional theories; Regulatory focus; Total quality managements (TQM); Motivation

We then introduce a new theoretical lens for studying TE that is grounded in the theory of practice and the concept of ""habitus"", which refers to aspects of culture that are anchored in the body of daily practices of individuals, groups, societies, and nations. Our proposed analytical framework views TE as a social realm of immigrants who operate in a complex, cross-national habitus, consisting of dual cultural, institutional and economic features from which actors can formulate their entrepreneurial strategies of action.

According to the theory, organizations are both consumers as well as producers of resources. This view has at least two implications for the way in which we think about the relation between organizations and their environments. The first is that the carrying capacity for organizational populations cannot be constant over time. The second is that the carrying capacity changes as a function of density - the number of organizations in a population. If the feedback view behind the theory is correct, the level of organizational density and the level of relevant resources are simultaneously determined. So far, the theory of system dependent organizational evolution has been validated only through computer simulation. In this paper we use data that we have collected on the population of US television station during the period 1940-2000 to subject some of the core propositions of the theory to empirical test. The preliminary results that we report in this paper provide strong support for some of the main predictions of the theory.",Feedback mechanisms; Organizational ecology; Television,Feedback control; Television; Television stations; Empirical test; Feedback mechanisms; Organizational ecology; Resource availability; Population statistics

A special focus is on firms' cooperation activities outside of the 3GPP, particularly in industry consortia and technical fora. The results suggest that dense external connections to other 3GPP members help firms make an impact on standards development within the 3GPP. Effective standard-setting strategies thus involve setting up a constellation of cooperative arrangements within the industry to maximize opportunities to influence peers. These results point to the significant role played by private and semi-public cooperative arrangements in determining standardization outcomes. In order to enable open access to standardization and subsequently to network markets, standards policymakers might consider financially supporting consortia activity of small firms and setting some rules about open membership.",Cooperative arrangements; Standard setting; Wireless telecommunication,Cooperative arrangements; Cooperative strategy; Longitudinal study; Standard setting; Standards development; Standards development organizations; Third generation partnership project (3GPP); Wireless telecommunications; Standardization
Selective revealing in open innovation processes: The case of embedded Linux,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088716958&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2006.22898660&partnerID=40&md5=1d60ab44c85163bdc12252894debdc0a,"This paper provides a quantitative study (N = 268) of patterns of free revealing of firm-developed innovations within embedded Linux, a type of open source software (OSS). I find that firms, without being obliged to do so, contribute many of their own developments back to public embedded Linux code, eliciting and indeed receiving informal development support from other firms. That is, they perform a part of their product development open to the public - an unthinkable idea for traditionally-minded managers. Such openness obviously entails the challenge of protecting one's intellectual property. I find that firms address this issue by revealing selectively. They reveal, on average, about half of the code they have developed, while protecting the other half by various means. Revealing is strongly heterogeneous among firms. Multivariate analysis can partly explain this heterogeneity by firm characteristics and the firm's purpose behind revealing. An analysis of reasons for revealing and of the type of revealed code shows that different types of firms have different rationales for openness. Implications for management are that the conflict between downsides and benefits of openness appears manageable. Provided selective revealing is practiced deliberately, the opportunities of open development seem to dominate.",Disclosure of inventions; Embedded Linux; Open source software,Codes (symbols); Linux; Multivariant analysis; Open systems; Development support; Disclosure of inventions; Embedded Linux; Multi variate analysis; Open development; Open innovation; Quantitative study; Open source software

Using an inductive logic and in-depth case studies, we explore how firms learn a strategically significant organizational process (i.e., dynamic capability in the strategy literature) from heterogeneous experience. The focal process is internationalization. The setting is six entrepreneurial firms with headquarters in three culturally distinct countries (i.e., Finland, United States, and Singapore). We show that organizational processes begin before, not through, ""doing"" as much research suggests. Processes further develop as leaders gain awareness about when to act and elaborate their understanding of how to act by blending various learning approaches. Finally, organizational processes evolve as managers heedfully create levels of abstraction in relevant rules, rather than habitually repeat standardized sets of rules. Overall, we sketch the content of strategically significant processes and highlight their common pattern of development. Besides making contributions to organizational learning, organizational change, and the nature of dynamic capabilities, we indicate the central insight that learning from heterogeneous experience centers on creating the cognitive sophistication of being an expert, not on honing a routine.",Capabilities; Learning,Blending; Capabilities; Entrepreneurial firms; Learning; Levels of abstraction; Organizational change; Organizational learning; Organizational process; Pattern of development; Enterprise resource management

When reading literature on how to develop employees and organisations, it strikes one how less focus there is on change and learning needs of individuals. This paper deals with this missing notion by detecting the change orientation of individuals in organisations and the learning behaviour of employees and how these two phenomena are intertwined. We explored the interconnections between these two individual developmental characteristics. From our explorative analysis can be suggested that change orientation and learning behaviour are linked with eachother based on two distinguished dimensions: a prospective orientation and a reflective orientation. And, based on the dichotomy between learning and performance, our study suggests that individual change orientations with a learning focus are linked with individual learning behaviour with a learning focus. The same holds for orientations towards changing and learning with a performance focus. Following these explorations, we recommend management consultants to manage change or learning in organisations in line with the dominant change and learning orientations of the employees.

The concept of architectural ambidexterity is developed building upon organization design and dynamic capabilities literatures. Architectural ambidexterity is a collective ability that enables an organization to integrate know-how and processes and systems to enact forms of connectivity that ensure endurance and accommodation to an unpredictable future by building an overarching basis for stability, requisite uniformity, facilitatory flexibility and anticipative connectivity.",,Dynamic models; Commoditization; Dynamic re-configuration; Environment change; Hypercompetition; Organization design; Resources and capabilities; Task demand; Technology transfer

Specifically, we examine the direct and indirect (through managerial risk behavior) effects of TMT long-term incentives on shareholder return. As expected, the level of aggregate long-term incentives held by the TMT exhibited a positive influence on shareholder return. Results also show that long-term incentives increased acquisition behavior; however, this effect was attenuated by the level of dispersion in TMT long-term incentives. Most interestingly, contrary to agency theory assumptions, our findings show that acquisition behavior exhibited a negative effect on shareholder return. Thus, while long-term incentives increased risk behavior, acquisitions decreased shareholder return. Taken together, we argue that these findings advance compensation theory and research by offering a more comprehensive theoretical understanding of the interest alignment properties of long-term incentives. In addition, these results highlight the necessity of examining both proximal (specific behaviors) and distal (performance measures) effects of long-term incentives in compensation theorizing and research.",Executive compensation; M&A; TMT,Alignment; Mergers and acquisitions; Agency theory; Black boxes; Executive compensation; Managerial risks; Performance measure; Risk behavior; Shareholder returns; TMT; Shareholders

Brand icons are characters that an audience identifies with a brand and the attributes that define that brand, while organizational icons are characters that are invested with and express the attributes and values that define an organization for its members. This paper draws on a qualitative case study of Heartland, a consumer products company, to describe how they (1) created an internal brand icon to personify the attributes of their brand's identity, and (2) established the brand icon as a symbol system shared throughout the organization. I develop propositions to explain how, by creating a compelling character and an elaborate narrative, Heartland identified their icon with their brand's attributes, and how, through employee training and the ubiquitous display of symbols pairing the icon and their brand, they established the icon as a shared symbol system. I also describe how organization members collectively came to identify the brand icon with the organization itself. I propose that several features of the icon's identity made the icon attractive to the organizational audience as a symbol of the organization's identity. And, I argue that by displaying symbols of the brand icon throughout the organization and by creating additional symbols that linked the icon with the organization but not with the brand, Heartland encouraged itself to invest the brand icon with attributes that defined the organization, so that the icon reflected their organizational identity back to them.",Brand; Icon,Consumer products; Brand; Brand identity; Employee training; Icon; Organizational identities; Qualitative case studies; Symbol systems; Ubiquitous displays; Personnel training

Our conceptual frame focuses not on how boards might prevent managers from ""behaving badly"", but rather on how they might impact a potentially equally significant managerial shortcoming, CEOs' failure to learn as much as they might from prior strategic decisions. Beyond sensitizing us to a likely link between boards and executive learning that is not contemplated by prevailing theory, an accountability theory perspective suggests a focus on a critical subset of director behaviors that we label ""board decision monitoring"", and define as the intensity and vigor with which directors demand explanations and justifications for CEOs' strategic decisions. Our theory argues that, generally speaking, board decision monitoring will enhance executives' capacities for learning from similar decisions made in the past. However, our theory departs from convention by specifying a range of conditions that are likely to reduce the benefits of intense monitoring. We further consider how, at the highest level of these contingency factors, intense monitoring might ultimately interfere with learning. Thus, our theory suggests at least the potential for a largely unexplored ""dark side"" to intense monitoring of firm CEOs by boards of directors.",,Managers; Monitoring; Boards of directors; Contingency factors; Experiential learning; Strategic decisions; Decision theory

These senior executive groups demonstrate four different approaches to managing innovation - sustaining the existing product, changing to the innovation, or actively balancing both products. Moreover, the balancing groups are either teamcentric where the entire group participated in making tradeoffs, or leadercentric where the leader makes tradeoffs. This research further finds that while team centric and leader centric groups allocate the responsibility for balancing differently, they both make decisions dynamically - vigilantly monitoring the needs of both products and making tradeoffs in their decisions. In contrast with prior research, these data suggest that senior executive groups can successfully balance both existing products and innovation.",Decision making; Exploration and exploitation; Top management teams,Commerce; Research; Exploration and exploitation; Incremental improvements; Long term performance; Managing innovation; Strategic business units; Top management teams; Decision making

We examine the effects of market diversification and vertical integration at the business-unit level and industry diversification at the corporate level on business-unit survival in a sample of independent and subunit higher education publishing firms from 1958 to 1990. We find that market diversification at the business-unit level increases the exit rate for both independent and subunit businesses, while we find partial support for the hypothesis that industry diversification at the corporate level decreases the exit rate for subunit businesses. For independent and subunit businesses, exit rates are lower for business units with vertically integrated marketing and distribution than for those with contractual relationships. The effects of corporate hierarchies on the survival of business units are contingent on the specialization of information processing at both the business-unit and corporate-parent levels. The results suggest a view of corporate hierarchies as information-processing systems in which market specialization has long term benefits for firms in industries characterized by market intermediation. hi.",Corporate; Hierarchy; Information processing,Data processing; Marketing; Contractual relationships; Corporate; Hierarchy; Information processing systems; Integrated marketing; Market specialization; Organizational forms; Vertical integration; Commerce

In so doing, we shift the attention from post-M&A performance to the pre-M&A process. We believe the latter is interesting in its own right, as many announced M&A deals are never completed or take a long time to be finalized. We explored these issues by applying an extended transaction cost perspective, merging in insights from behavioral and institutional theories. That is, we construct experience (behavioral theory) and distance (institutional theory) variables that we argue to affect the level of an M&A deal's transaction costs. We test our hypotheses with of 3,851 international M&A events that were announced in the worldwide business service industry between 1981 and 2001. A complex set of results is produced, suggesting that indeed firm experience and country distance affect M&A completion and duration.",,Merging; Behavioral theory; Business service; Cross-border; Institutional theory; International business; National cultures; Transaction cost; Societies and institutions

Within such a structure, subsidiary initiative and knowledge transfer are viewed as sources of competitive advantage. While research from this perspective is increasing, there is still much to learn about how strategy, structure and knowledge interrelate within MNCs. This paper reports the results of a study of how knowledge transfer has facilitated the sequential roll-out of discrete country operations of a global network service firm and identifies the role of four key practices: retention, adaptation transference and experimentation.",,Competition; Competitive advantage; Global networks; Key practices; Knowledge transfer; Multinational corporations; World-wide operations; Knowledge management

It is thought to possess many benefits. Nevertheless, its implementation and outcomes are often controversial. Being by and large a US phenomenon, there is little research that specifically examines PFP acceptance in the Asian context, where its introduction and proliferation are relatively recent. Using a sample drawn from organizations in the US and China (Hong Kong) we find that employee acceptance of and reactions to PFP are contingent upon a number of contextual forces. Attempting to generalize differences based solely on cultural stereo-types, however, could prove detrimental to PFP success. We find that it would be equally hazardous for managers adopting US style PFP not to investigate the potential influence of a host of demographic, organizational, and other factors. Evaluating PFP according to the diagnostic checklist we introduce is an important step toward identifying potential areas of concern. By conducting the various levels of analysis presented here, managers can ascertain the appropriateness of introducing PFP and explore patterns as well as systematic differences that warrant further consideration and adaptation.",,Areas of concerns; Contextual forces; Cross-border; Hong-kong; Levels of analysis; Organizational performance; Performance rewards; Managers

Using data from Compustat and the US Census Bureau on over 55,000 manufacturing plants from 1973 to 2000, we measure the learning rate as the coefficient on prior cumulative output in a production function. We find that the rate of ""industry learning-intensity"" displays considerable variation across industries and that after controlling for industry-wide technology improvements, it is positively correlated with the industry capital-labor ratio and the industry R&D and advertising intensity. More importantly, we find evidence that the industry learning-intensity affects the heterogeneity of firm performance. In particular, higher rates of learning are associated with wider dispersion in firm q and firm profitability. Depending on the estimation method adopted to compute learning coefficients, a standard deviation increase in the industry learning intensity increases the interpercentile range (10th to 90th) of firm profitability by 16 to 25 percent over the mean, which is comparable to the increase resulting from a standard deviation increase in industry R&D or advertising intensity. These findings imply that learning-intensity expands the range of industry profitability, and thus it represents an important characteristic of the industry environment.",Heterogeneity; Learning by doing,Learning algorithms; Manufacture; Marketing; Profitability; Statistics; Advertising intensities; Heterogeneity; Industry environment; Industry profitability; Learning by doing; Learning coefficients; Learning environments; Technology improvement; Computer aided instruction

It is a reality that organisations often struggle to achieve, and so an understanding of how to successfully design, form and manage multinational groups is imperative. Research into the nature of multinational teams is growing, but still in its infancy especially with respect to differences between multinational and nationally homogeneous teams. One strand of this nascent literature centers on collective team identity. I argue in this theoretical paper that a key element of the broad social integration processes that lead to a collective team identity is the presentation of status cues (e.g., nationality, race, gender, professional qualifications, speech behaviour) and their subsequent interpretation in the form of a status hierarchy. I draw on Berger and colleagues' work on status cues (1986) to propose that in developing a collective team identity highly heterogeneous multinational groups will make more use of task indicative cues and less use of task expressive cues and highly homogeneous nationally homogeneous groups will make more use of task expressive cues and less use of task indicative cues. In highly heterogeneous multinational groups the collective identity will be task-focused and develop over a longer period, whereas in highly homogeneous nationally homogeneous groups it will be relationship-focused and develop over a shorter period. As a result, highly heterogeneous multinational teams will outperform highly homogeneous nationally homogeneous teams in terms of approach to task and time to task completion.",Multinational; Status; Teams,Collective identity; Global business; Homogeneous group; Multinational; Professional qualifications; Social integrations; Status; Teams

In addition to testing primary elements of this relationship, we draw on source credibility theory and the relational perspective to refine our understanding by considering the relative influence of information from external (e.g., strategy consultants) versus internal (e.g., management) sources. We find that a rational-comprehensive process increases the likelihood that decision-makers will pursue an incremental, rather than radical, action. Results also indicate that external advisors have differential impact-sometimes stronger, sometimes weaker-contingent upon the nature of the decision process, and the nature of the recommendation (i.e., radical versus incremental).",Comprehensiveness; Consultants; Organizational decision making,Comprehensiveness; Consultants; Decision makers; Decision making process; Decision process; Information sources; Organizational decision making; Source credibility theory; Strategic decisions; Management science

However, most previous status studies focus on examining the consequences of organizational status positions by assuming the existence of the status structure. Consequently, little is know how the status structure as a systemic level property affects organizations as it emerges and evolves in a field. To address this issue, we provide a dynamic construct of the status structure as the extent to which distinctive and stable status positions or categories form. We then hypothesize that there is a curvilinear relationship between the status structure and organizational life chance. Our historical analysis of American college football major bowls from 1902 to 2004 yields strong support to our hypothesis. We conclude by urging future research to continue to examine the dynamics of the status structure and its organizational consequences.",Organizational life chance; Organizational status; The status structure,Historical analysis; Know-how; Organizational life chance; Organizational status

Meanwhile, the international strategy literature interprets global learning as an adaptive, mechanistic vehicle to multinational corporation (MNC) integration and performance improvement. This paper extends the dominant logic construct to globalization theory and reexamines its applicability within a global understanding framework. Using a perspectival framework of 'flows' or 'scapes' that inform individuals, global understanding is differentiated from global learning. Cultural diversity is defined epistemologically, as different ways of understanding versus different ways of doing things. MNCs are reconceptualized as contesting, negotiating processes among epistemic communities. Artificial boundaries of nation-state are superseded by space, divorced from place, which is determined epistemologically by ways of knowing and understanding. Theoretical implications significant for the strategy research paradigm are discussed in terms of consensus building and globalizing as ongoing processes. The structural- and temporal-based theories of the firm are replaced with a unique processual and spatial theoretical framework. Practical implications are explored from the perspectives of transnationalism and MNC acquisition processes.",,Managers; Regional planning; Acquisition process; Artificial boundaries; Cultural diversity; Global learning; Logic constructs; Logic models; Mental maps; Multinational corporations; Performance improvements; Strategy research; Theoretical framework; Transnationalism; Industry

Although Hofstede indicated that cultural values are related to a number of individual and country characteristics, this part of his research has been least referenced and virtually no research has focused on explaining the nature of cultural variations within and between countries. Despite numerous pointers of a substantial within-country variation, the national averages have dominated the research in the field and one's nationality has been frequently equated to one's cultural values. The results of the multilevel multivariate meta-analysis of 508 studies show that cultures are shaped by a set of individual and country level factors providing a basis for explaining the within and between country variations in culture.

Following the dynamic capabilities perspective, we suggest that antecedents to innovation can be found at the individual, firm, and network level. Thus, we challenge two assumptions common in prior research. First, significant variance exists at the focal level of analysis, while other levels of analysis are assumed to be homogeneous. Second, the focal level of analysis is more or less independent from other levels of analysis. Accordingly, we advance a set of hypotheses to assess the effect of individual, firm, and network-level antecedents on innovation output. We then investigate whether a firm's antecedents to innovation lie across different levels. To accomplish this, we propose two competing hypotheses. We juxtapose the propositions that the individual, firm, and network-level antecedents to innovation are substitutes versus complements. We test our multi-level theoretical model using an unusually comprehensive and detailed panel dataset that documents the innovation attempts of global pharmaceutical companies within the new biotechnology paradigm over a 23-year time period. We find evidence that the antecedents to innovation lie across different levels of analysis and can have compensating or reinforcing effects on firm-level innovative output.",Innovation; Muti-level theory,Dynamic capabilities; Levels of analysis; Muti-level theories; Network level; Pharmaceutical company; Reinforcing effects; Research questions; Theoretical modeling; Statistical tests

To study this, we differentiate among a firm's direct ties, indirect ties and the redundancy among them. Analyzing their role in the pharmaceutical, chemical and automotive industry we show that the exploration-exploitation distinction forms an important factor for understanding a firm's optimal network structure, and that the differences in network optimality between both tasks is one of degree. Moreover, we find that this differential role of a firm's alliance network remains invariant across the three industries, enhancing the generalisability of the empirical results.

Theories on strategy and organizational configurations along with measures of scope and a novel data set were used to classify 796 firms into five mutually exclusive groups. Each group had distinct scope characteristics across two competitive dimensions: (1) breadth and (2) mix of core versus non-core businesses. Analysis of the scope variables revealed five strategic types (along with the number of firms representing each strategy) defined as follows: (1) Core Service Provider (340 firms with the smallest scope providing core set of patient care services), (2) Mission Driven (52 firms with the next smallest scope offering core set of services to underserved populations), (3) Contractor (266 firms with medium scope and affiliating with numerous physician groups), (4) Health Plan Driven (83 firms with large scope providing health plans and emphasizing high-tech acute care) and (5) Entrepreneur (55 firms with the largest scope offering both a core set of services and investing in a variety of new non-core business opportunities including many forprofit ventures). Significant differences in financial performance among the strategies were found when controlling for payer reimbursement conditions.

Building on the work of Herbert Simon, we propose that a design science approach can be used to complement the conventional approaches in operations management, which are based on the methodologies adopted from the natural sciences, principally, Carl Hempel's hypothetico-deductive reasoning. The goal of this paper is to explicate an epistemology and methodology for the logic of discovery and problem-solving in operations management research. The process is illustrated through an in-depth case of a multi-year research project concerning new information technologies, where the performance frontier was affected through the development of applications that enabled the use of simpler integrating mechanisms and thus performance improvements in multiple dimensions. The case example illustrates why successful solution designs do not automatically translate to performance improvements but require step-wise development and introduction of the solutions in practice. If this is to be done under the rubric of scientific research, the proper methodology must be explicated.",,Information technology; Research; Conventional approach; Design science; Multiple dimensions; Operations management; Performance improvements; Principles of design; Real-life problems; Scientific researches; Management

Consultants play a prominent role in the supply of new and fashionable organization concepts on the market for management solutions, but it is still unclear how they use these concepts in their assignments within client organizations. Drawing on the work of Schön, this study shows that, unlike current conceptualizations, consultants do neither regard the construction of problems and solutions as predetermined by these concepts nor as an entirely unstructured and open-ended effort. More specifically, our analysis identifies several key factors related to the client, the problem situation and the consultant's background that determine the variety of possible routes in the way problems and solutions are constructed during consulting assignments. We believe this has some notable implications for any theoretical treatment of the client-consultant relationship and the role of new concepts and methods in this.",,Client organizations; Consulting assignments; Problems and Solutions; Theoretical treatments

To date, there is no systematic investigation of knowledge reuse in open source software projects. This study attempts to fill this gap. The focus is on the practice of knowledge reuse which consists of the inventory and the incidents of knowledge reuse. The study inductively develops theory based on quantitative and qualitative data drawn from a sample of six open source software projects. We find that knowledge reuse is extensive across the sample and that developers shift their creative effort over time, from reusing software more than writing, to writing more than reusing.

Building on absorptive capacity and social network theory, I present and test a theoretical model to explain the differences in individuals' contributions to organizational innovativeness. The model is premised on the notion that innovation stems from the novel combination of different sources of knowledge and, as such, is the result of collective rather than individual efforts. Focusing on the type of knowledge internalized, by whom, and the interaction patterns through which it is applied to the generation of innovations I argue that both the structure of knowledge and the structure of social networks are critical aspects of the absorptive capacity process. Hypotheses derived from the theoretical framework are tested using original sociometric data collected from 276 scientists, researchers, and engineers from 16 R&D labs of a multinational semiconductor producer. Results indicate that knowledge sourced from outside the organization enhances individuals' contributions to organizational innovativeness. These benefits however, are contingent upon the type of external knowledge sourced by individuals and how similar or different this knowledge is to the knowledge available through their network of contacts inside the organization.",,Absorptive capacity; External knowledge; Innovativeness; Interaction pattern; Social network theory; Social Networks; Social process; Theoretical framework; Theoretical models; Social networking (online)

Using our Spiral Network model, we were able to explicate the mechanisms driving the processes of innovation across these two Internet technologies. We show that technological innovations are created through the mechanisms of translation and inscription where actors create actor-networks by translating: a) actors who are directly or indirectly vested in the technology, b) users, c) technologies, d) regulations and state regimes, and e) practices in the market. We also find that these external actions are tightly linked to an internal cognitive shift that originates from frame-breaking beliefs held by the actors. These beliefs inscribed onto technological artifacts further reinforce the innovation efforts. Furthermore, we found that these actions provide an initial momentum that is sustained through the mechanism of framing. Together these forces ""spiral"" towards path lock-in stage where a level of ""black-box"" is attained. Un-blackboxing occurs as other actors continue to ""mindfully"" deviate within the dominant actor-networks but we show that resistance that arises from many trials-of-strength is a key trigger that allows for successful new paths to be created.",ANT; Innovation; IT development,Actor-network; External action; Initial momentum; Internet technology; It development; Longitudinal study; Network modeling; Technological innovation; Search engines

This paper uses two laboratory experiments to investigate the timing of a trust breach that interrupts a string of cooperative choices in an iterated prisoners' dilemma. A programmed counterpart defected twice - at the start of the interaction or after 5 or after 10 trials, or not at all. The findings indicate that ""getting off on the wrong foot"" has devastating long-run consequences and that later trust breaches, although planting a seed of distrust, can be overcome, often fairly quickly. Thus, there is hope combined with costs after a trust breach.",Trust; Trust repair,Cooperative interactions; Interpersonal relationship; Iterated prisoners' dilemma; Laboratory experiments; Trust; Seed

Therefore, we need to investigate how one firm's industrial network position based on institutional ties influence its innovation. We also need to know how one firm's industry hierarchical position influence the relationship between network position and innovation. Using network data containing firm level and processing by UCINET software, we drew graphs and digraphs of the global semiconductor industry.

When the market value of the patent is uncertain and embodiment costs are irreversible, there is an option value to delay the acquisition of complementary assets to produce in-house, creating a potential incentive to license. I show that uncertainty increases the reservation value of the licensor making more difficult to engage in technology licensing deals. The licensor avoids transferring a technology whose true value is unknown, and prefers to hold it unexploited. Moreover, I find that complementary assets become a strategic advantage for the firm exploiting the patent, only in the case of incremental inventions with low uncertainty. I test these findings using a novel dataset derived from a survey of European inventors.",Licensing; Patents; Real options,Commerce; Nuclear reactor licensing; Statistical tests; Complementary assets; Market values; Option value; Patented invention; Patents; Real Options; Strategic advantages; Technology licensing; Patents and inventions

Using a sample from the 2000 National Survey of Giving, Volunteering, and Participating (NSGVP), we find that ESV benefits positively influence employees' volunteer hours, skill acquisition from volunteering, and employer recognition of the employees' volunteer activities. We also find that volunteer hours do predict skills acquired from volunteering and that acquired skills from volunteering increase the likelihood of employees being recognized by the employer. Contrary to our expectations, volunteer hours appear to negatively impact the likelihood of employees being recognized for their volunteering. We interpret this finding as indicating that it is in the employer's best interest to have its employees maximize skill acquisition from volunteering with minimal time allocation.",Employer-supported volunteering (ESV); Gift exchange; Reciprocity,Knowledge management; Employer-supported volunteering (ESV); Reciprocity; Skill acquisition; Time allocation; Human resource management

Our study demonstrated that PFP has two advantages for firms relative to FS pay: first, they attract higher-quality employees and shed lower-quality employees, and second, they motivate employees to put forward more effort. Using real-effort laboratory experiments with salient incentives, we examine the impact of pay-for-performance (PFP) versus fixedsalary (FS) compensation on productivity. PFP achieved significantly higher productivity through both sorting and incentive effects. In particular, more productive employees selected PFP, and employees on average, regardless of their preferred compensation scheme, produced more under PFP. Risk preferences were also important. Less risk-averse individuals were both more likely to select PFP and also more responsive to PFP incentives.",Agency theory; Experimental; Pay-for-performance,Agency theory; Compensation scheme; Experimental; Experimental studies; Incentive effects; Laboratory experiments; Pay-for-performance; Risk preference; Productivity

Research suggests that implementation failure occurs when managers do not gain their employees' skilled, consistent, and committed program (or product) use (Klein, Conn, & Sorra, 2001). Thus, the need to understand both commitment to change and the implementation stage of organizational change remains critical. The purpose of this paper is to enable researchers to better predict attitudinal and behavioral reactions to an organizational change by specifying how dyadic influence mechanisms within social networks relate to employee commitment to the change-and ultimately to implementation. Two theories are used to understand the process employees go through in deciding to support and implement a change. First, I use behavioral reasons theory (Westaby, 2000) to identify the reasons people consider when deciding to support or resist a change. Second, I use social information processing theory (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978) and suggest that people emphasize different reasons for and against supporting a change after interacting with different network partners. I then use social network theory (Burt, 1987) to argue that employees' commitment to change is in part due to the reasons they adopt from influential exchange partners at work. This research allows researchers and managers to trace how employees influence attitudes and behaviors during an organizational change; more specifically it explains the social influence mechanisms that lead to commitment to change and implementation behaviors. This work helps researchers understand more about the social-contextual factors related to organizational change and it helps practitioners intervene in facilitating the implementation of organizational change initiatives.",,Economic and social effects; Human resource management; Managers; Contextual factors; Employee commitment; Influence mechanism; Organizational change; Social influence; Social information processing theory; Use social networks; Behavioral research

In this study, we investigate the presence of aversive sexism by examining relationships between emotional experience and emotion regulation in a masculine organization, an Australian Police Force ('APF'). One hundred and fifty-nine male participants answered a workplace feelings and behavior survey designed to examine whether men experience higher negative and positive emotions in the presence of males than females, to examine the extent to which emotion regulation is directly associated with the intensity of negative and positive emotions, and whether or not the experience of negative and positive emotions mediates a proposed positive association between the regulation of emotions and the intensity of negative and positive emotions.

This study takes a step to close this research gap by investigating the relationship between downsizing and innovation output measured by patents granted before and after downsizing. We analyse a panel dataset of downsizings by UK firms during the 1994 -2004 period. Our results reveal that while low and medium levels of downsizing have no significant impact on innovation output, high level downsizing is more likely to have a significant and negative impact on innovation output.",Downsizing; Innovation; Patent,Competition; Downsizing; Patent; Sustainable competitive advantages; Patents and inventions

Pressures for legitimacy at the institutional level suggest firm age, size and industry shifts in stakeholder management will increase the likelihood of changes in stakeholder management for the focal firm. We posit organizational risk and performance will also increase the likelihood of change as will managerial discretion and top management team (TMT) turnover.

Shared emotions and group effectiveness: The role of broadening-and- building interactions,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858645148&partnerID=40&md5=d166793671ffd66d0b6f4f089674722e,"This research explores how positive emotions shared among group members influence group effectiveness, and how broadening-and-building interactions mediate this relationship. Prior research has neither conceptually specified nor empirically tested the causal mechanisms that explain how and why group emotions influence group outcomes. I sought to fill this gap by introducing broadening-and-building interactions as a group level mechanism. Drawing from the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions (Fredrickson, 1998), I proposed that group members that shared an emotion of joy would exhibit more frequent broadening-and-building interactions (i.e., building on ideas, morale-building communication and active affirmation) than those that shared neutral emotions. In turn, broadening-and-building interactions were expected to enhance group creativity, members' satisfaction with the group and member learning but decrease groups' decision quality. To test the hypotheses, I conducted an experiment with 72 workgroups with multi-method measures (survey, observation, objective performance rating). The results showed that broadening-and-building interactions were indeed the key mechanism that explained the relationship between a group emotion of joy and group effectiveness. Groups experiencing a shared emotion of joy showed more frequent broadening-and-building interactions than groups experiencing neutral emotions. Regression analyses demonstrated that broadening-and-building interactions, in turn, increased group creativity and members' satisfaction with the group but decreased group decision-making performance. Mediation analyses confirmed the overall proposed sequence of relations: a group emotion of joy leading to broadening-and-building interactions, and further to group effectiveness. I discuss the theoretical contributions of the research to group, individual emotions, and group emotions literatures, as well as the future research directions.",Group effectiveness; Group emotions; Group member interactions,Buildings; Regression analysis; Research; Decision quality; Future research directions; Group decision-making; Group effectiveness; Group emotions; Group level; Group members; Mediation analysis; Multi methods; Performance ratings; Positive emotions; Workgroups; Group theory
Directions of new venture growth in their beginning years,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088752522&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2006.22898236&partnerID=40&md5=6b25469896e8cbf84f54172b37991635,"This paper examines whether new ventures growth is a function of their diversification strategies into related markets, and if so, what are the determinants of which markets the new ventures choose to enter. The analysis takes advantage of a unique dataset that contains fine-grained, detailed information on the products and services offered by high-tech startups in their beginning years since founding. Despite the risks associated with diversification when new ventures are both young and small, the results suggest that new ventures have a higher probability of entering a new market if the configuration of their capabilities - inferred from their product/service mix - is more similar to the dominant configuration observed around their time of founding. Further, the effect of entry on growth rate is larger when the capability configuration of new ventures approximates the dominant configuration observed in the market. These findings have managerial implications, suggesting that when the direction of growth fits the configuration of capabilities that is dominant around the time of founding, new ventures achieve a higher sales growth rate in their beginning years through diversifying entry into related markets.",Configuration of capabilities; Market entry and growth rate; New ventures,Risks; Sales; Configuration of capabilities; Diversification strategies; Fine grained; Managerial implications; Market entry and growth rates; New ventures; Products and services; Sales growth; Commerce
Identity and bond theories to understand design decisions for online communities,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858663086&partnerID=40&md5=f98663464eb1fe0534991e96486dc229,"When we develop systems and policies for online communities, we make design decisions that may appeal to some members but discourage others. In this article, we examine online community design decisions in light of the common identity and common bond theories from social psychology. These theories posit two kinds of attachment to online groups - attachment to the group as a whole (group identity) and attachment to individual group members (member bonds). We review literature on the antecedents of group identity (social categorization, in-group interdependence, and out-group presence) and member bonds (social interaction, personal knowledge, and interpersonal similarity), and convergent and divergent consequences of the two types of attachment. We discuss implications of these antecedents and consequences for critical design tradeoffs, such as those associated with constraining or promoting off-topic discussion, requiring authentication or allowing anonymity, limiting group size or allowing uncontrolled growth, and structuring content or leaving it unstructured.",Design; Group identity; Online communities,Design; Online systems; Websites; Bond theory; Critical design; Design decisions; Group identity; Group members; Group size; Online communities; Social interactions; Social psychology; Group theory
Control of resources and patterns of network interaction under competing institutional pressures,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858671530&partnerID=40&md5=67299c1587a2c1a9dcc45f9b6f250234,"This article examines a publicly funded mental health services network, focusing on the patterns of interaction in five resource-based sub-networks. We argue that the structure of network relationships can be explained by examining control over access to the resources needed by network members. Depending on whether control over a particular resource is concentrated or dispersed among network members, subnetwork structures will differ in predictable ways. We also draw on neo-institutional theory to argue that these interactions are consistent with responses to technical institutional pressures versus professional, norm-based pressures. We found that the pattern of interactions among network organizations in resource-based sub-networks appears to be dependent on the organization(s) controlling these resources (the Network Administrative Organization versus network members) as well as the nature of the resource (tangible vs. intangible).

Moreover, their direct experience in solo projects had deleterious effects: firstly, prior failure experience decreased the likelihood of drug approval; and secondly, past solo successes increased the hazard rate for project termination. These effects hold after controlling for systematic differences in initial project governance choice. We also found that collaborative projects were only faster to market than projects initiated by acquired firms.

At the same time, in many investment markets an increasing portion of equity is not owned directly by individuals but rather is owned by institutional intermediaries or investors including pension plans; and globalization has augmented available investment opportunities. Based on these trends, we address the research question Do US pension plans engage in socially responsible investing in their non-domestic investing? We compare US and UK pension plan investments in the UK FTSE 300, a market of social and financial investing opportunities similar to the US S&P 500. A series of hypotheses is developed and tested based on the pension plans' two countries of origin; four types of pension plans; and three CSP dimensions of environment, workplace, and community. Firms in the pension plans' portfolios are evaluated on these CSP and various CFP criteria. Among US pension plan types, we found that union plan portfolios are positively related to workplace practices and private plan portfolios to the community dimension. UK local, foundation, and private plan portfolios have a positive relationship with the environment dimension, and UK union plan portfolios have a positive relationship with workplace practices.

The aim of this paper is to address this knowledge gap by exploring the relationship between acculturation strategies and integrative complexity. Following the predictions of the Acculturation Complexity Model (ACM, Tadmor & Tetlock, in press), we suggest that biculturals will reach higher levels of integrative complexity than will assimilated and separated individuals in both the cultural and general domain. These hypotheses were supported in a study of Asian-American college students (study 1) and replicated in a sample of Israelis working in the US. We further tested the direction of causality hypothesized in the model-that biculturals' higher levels of integrative complexity are the result of the acculturation process. Through the use of priming manipulations, we were able to show support for this hypothesis (study 3).

Yet, what allows some people to shift into these positions has received far less attention. We sought to fill this hole in the literature by offering socio-cognitive explanations for why and how some come to occupy critical positions while others do not. We proposed and found that self-construal-or how people view themselves in relation to their social world-affects people's ability to learn and understand a novel social network. The greater people's cognitive ability, the faster they learned the network. However, self-construal attenuated the effect; cognitive ability mattered for those who had a more independent (i.e., less relational) self-construal, but had no effect on learning for those who were more relational in their self-construal. Given more time, those higher in relational self-construal (RSC) developed more accurate perceptions of the status and power relations in the network. The same was not true of those who were low in RSC.

The four theories of profit under competition and their interactions: An abbreviated summary,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087244572&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2006.22896777&partnerID=40&md5=f8c3b7968372dc1786e77f826c2efd05,"Theories about what causes profit have played a central role in the development of the strategy field. Virtually all of these theories can be fit into one or more of the following four categories, according to the type of causal mechanism that they rely upon most heavily: collusion-based mechanisms, competencebased mechanisms, governance-based mechanisms, and flexibility-based mechanisms. While much research has been focused on developing and testing theories about the ""main effects"" of each of these individual types of causal mechanisms when applied in isolation from each other, far less attention has been focused on understanding the ""interaction effects"" of these causal mechanisms, where multiple pathways to profitability are combined together simultaneously. Are their interaction effects positive (mutually reinforcing or amplifying) or negative (mutually dampening or undermining)? In other words, is the combined joint effect of any given combination of these four profit-generation mechanisms equal to, greater than, or less than the sum of the separate parts? Using techniques of formal economic modeling, the present paper takes a first step toward developing a general theory that makes predictions about the answers to these questions, and also about the ""boundary conditions"" under which the main effects of these profit-generation mechanisms will have a positive effect on profit. The models developed herein predict ten propositions about the main effects and the two-way and three-way interaction effects. The implications of these ten propositions for the future of strategic management research, practice, pedagogy, and theory are discussed.",Interaction effect; Synthesis; Theory of profit,Planning; Synthesis (chemical); Economic modeling; Generation mechanism; Interaction effect; Multiple pathways; Strategic management; Testing theories; Theory of profits; Three-way interactions; Profitability

In this paper we investigate the role of inspirational leadership in influencing identification in geographically dispersed teams. Based on social identity theory, we proposed that leaders, particularly inspirational leaders, can play a key role in enhancing an individual's identification with the team. We considered trust in team members as a partial mediator of the relationship between inspirational leadership and identification. Further, using a cross-level methodology we examined team level dispersion as a moderating influence on the individual level relationship between perceptions of inspirational leadership and identification with the team. Based on a sample of 170 dispersed employees nested within 41 teams providing customer service and support in a Fortune 500 software and hardware company with operations in over 40 countries, our results indicate that inspirational leadership predicted identification with the team. Inspirational leadership also predicted trust in team members which, in turn, predicted identification with the team. In addition, team dispersion moderated the relationship between inspirational leadership and individual's team identification as well as trust. The positive relationship between inspirational leadership and identification with the team and trust in team members was strengthened in teams that were more dispersed. Finally, aggregated members' identification with the team predicted team performance.",Geographically dispersed teams; Identification; Leadership,Identification (control systems); Customer service and support; Geographically dispersed teams; Individual levels; Inspirational leaders; Leadership; Social identity theories; Software and hardwares; Team identification; Dispersions

On one side, arguments have been presented for establishing a clearer identity by developing a distinct, core paradigm to guide IS research. On the other side of the debate, arguments have been made for increased diversity. Although this debate continues, the actual consequences of consensus and diversity for knowledge production remain unclear. This paper focuses on one aspect of diversity: the theoretical approaches underlying empirical research. Drawing from a review of the empirical literature on interorganizational information systems (IOS) published between 1990 and 2003, we identify both ""tight"" and ""loose"" areas of theory in the IOS literature. In the two tight areas (the economic theory approach and the diffusion of innovations approach), studies generally reinforce theorized relationships and establish robust findings. However, close examination also reveals areas of diversity within these tight areas. In the loose area (social systems approach), a wider variety of theories has been used, generating a larger number of empirical relationships that are less robust. We conclude that the IOS literature exhibits both consensus and diversity, suggesting that IS is a heterogeneous field in which both loose and tight areas of theory contribute.",,Information systems; Information use; Diffusion of innovations; Empirical literature; Empirical relationships; Empirical research; Inter-organizational information system; Knowledge production; Theoretical approach; Theoretical foundations; Economics

We use this case to develop theory about how organizational features, such as work practices and norms, can disrupt conventional masculine identity-construction processes. In this case, organizational features intended to enhance safety and effectiveness had the unintended effect of profoundly changing how men enacted masculinity on the job. Interview and participant observation data show that, rather than seeking to enhance their masculine image to others and to themselves, men expressed their vulnerability: they acknowledged their physical limitations, learned from their mistakes, and attended to their own and others' emotions. The result was deeper, more intimate coworker relationships in which men could express more broadly-defined selves. Oil-rig workers who had used machismo to prove their competence now had a more nuanced sense of their personal capacities, particularly a capacity for vulnerability, the antithesis of the blue-collar masculine ideal. These individual capacities in turn enhanced overall team functioning. Our findings question the immutability of masculine identity as a social status achievement-which is how previous literature depicts it-and points to how organizations can disrupt such tendencies and stand to gain in the process.",,Drilling platforms; Offshore oil well production; Construction process; Offshore oil platform; Oil-rigs; Participant observations; Personal capacity; Physical limitations; Social status; Work practices; Image enhancement

This study investigates whether alliances create value by examining the sum of weighted returns to matched pairs of alliance partners to determine whether there is net value creation from alliances or whether alliances are a zero sum game, where gains in value to one alliance partner result in losses in value for another. Furthermore, the study investigates whether the value created by alliances is longer-lived by examining whether alliances decrease firms' systematic risk. Alliances ought to reduce firms' risk by decreasing firms' susceptibility to environmental uncertainty, allowing for risk sharing, and allowing for reversibility of resource-commitments. The study finds that alliances do result in net value creation for matched alliance pairs. However, about 50% of matched pairs experience negative abnormal returns, indicating that alliances with higher than average returns create this positive value. The study also finds that on average alliances decrease firms' systematic risk and the weighted-average of Betas for matched alliance pairs is also lower. Furthermore, different alliance types have different riskreduction benefits. These findings have important implications for theory and practice.",Alliances; Risk; Value creation,Risk management; Risks; Abnormal returns; Alliances; Environmental uncertainty; Resource commitment; Risk-reduction benefits; Theory and practice; Value creation; Weighted averages; Game theory

The results suggest that boards that are dominated by trustees appointed by the governor or elected by the state (""political boards"") increase benefits more than boards that are dominated by trustees that represent system beneficiaries (""non-political boards""). In addition, political boards appear to be more sensitive to election cycles and the state's fiscal balance than nonpolitical boards. The paper explores possible explanations for the counterintuitive results. Pension fund governance and board composition has been highlighted in a number of previous studies. The vast majority of these papers focus on the relationship between board composition and investment performance or fund solvency, and the studies are decidedly inconclusive. I shift the focus from the asset management side to the benefit side of retirement system decision making. I can thus bypass many of the difficulties that plague previous studies - such as endogenous asset mixes and investment restrictions - and better examine the effect of pension fund governance. This study makes a number of contributions. First, it reexamines the question of public pension system board influence in a setting that can offer more conclusive results. Second, it advances the study of how the choice of managerial control of public retirement systems are influenced by political and fiscal factors. More generally, the paper highlights the forces and incentives that may impact management officers in charge of public moneys.",,Pension plans; Investment performance; Pension funds; Pension system; Public employees; Decision making

Increase in developing country foreign direct investment on the one hand, and trends promoting democratization and competitive elections on the other hand provide an ideal research opportunity to investigate possible investment-election linkages. We do so through development and testing of a framework integrating partisan and opportunistic political business cycle (""PBC"") theories to predict trends in the count of major investment projects announced in 18 emerging-market countries holding 31 presidential elections from 1987-2000. Consistent with the framework, we find that firms sponsoring major project investments perceive lower investment risk in the form of more investment project announcements as left-wing political incumbents appear more likely to be replaced by right-wing challengers. Similarly, we find that announced project counts are lower for right-wing incumbents in ""close-call"" elections with left-wing challengers or in elections where left-wing challengers are likely to oust the right-wing. These negative ""right-wing"" effects on investment project counts even persist into the year after the election. Overall, our results suggest that firms sponsoring major investment projects also ""vote"" in developing-country elections by significantly and substantially varying the number and dollar amount of announced investment projects important to developing country economic growth. For international business research, these findings demonstrate the value of using PBC theoretical lenses to understand links between short-term electoral politics and long-term investment risk and decision-making in developing countries.",Developing countries; Elections; Project finance,Decision making; Developing countries; Economics; Integration testing; Development and testing; Elections; Foreign direct investments; International business; Investment decision making; Presidential election; Project finance; Research opportunities; Investments

The major objective of this paper is to provide a framework that addresses the effects of national and corporate cultural distance on various integration approaches, and thereby explain international M&A performance. Specifically, it suggests that international M&A that approximate its 'ideal types' of integration approaches is hypothesized to be more effective than other M&A. Based on this framework propositions that can serve as a guide for future research are suggested. Finally, the framework can assist managers of international mergers in analyzing, evaluating, and planning before the merger and in implementing the chosen integration approach after the merger.",,Merging; Empirical findings; Empirical studies; Ideal types; Integration approach; Integration process; Mergers and acquisitions performance; National cultures; Theoretical development; Mergers and acquisitions

Despite the popular press focus on this phenomenon of talented women voluntarily exiting the labor force, limited research has explored this socalled ""opt-out revolution"" from a scholarly perspective. Therefore, this manuscript presents a conceptual investigation of women's choices regarding work arrangements. We draw on theories of identity and social influence to depict a model and develop propositions that posit relationships between identity, social influence, and choices regarding work. Theoretical contributions, practical implications, and directions for future research are also discussed.",Identity; Social influence; Women,Dependent care; Identity; Labor force; Social influence; Women; Women's careers; Work-life balance; Economic and social effects
Entrepreneurial orientation effects on new venture performance: The moderating role of venture age,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087224210&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2006.22898263&partnerID=40&md5=5f3bb3b3fbacd116992b9a3ba7f83e06,"The entrepreneurial orientation (EO) construct has been the subject of a wide stream of literature addressing the propensity of an organization to behave in a manner consistent with an entrepreneurial strategy. Firm entrepreneurial behavior is evidenced in this study across the dimensions of innovativeness, proactiveness, risk-taking, and competitive aggressiveness. These dimensions relate to the entrepreneurial strategy-making processes of a firm and have been argued to vary independently (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Using a random national sample of new ventures as well as a combined sample of high growth ventures (Inc. 500), this research tests whether the strength of the relationships between each individual EO dimension and new venture performance are moderated by the age of a venture. The results indicate that as new ventures age their innovativeness and risk-taking behaviors become less strongly associated with new venture performance. Conversely, a venture's proactiveness and competitive aggressiveness were shown to develop stronger positive associations with new venture performance overtime.",,Entrepreneurial behavior; Entrepreneurial orientation; Entrepreneurial strategy making; Innovativeness; New venture performance; New ventures; Proactiveness; Risk-taking behaviors; Risk management

We explore the relationship between downsizing and family ownership status among Fortune 500 firms. We propose that family firms downsize less than non-family firms, irrespective of performance, because their relationship with employees is based on normative commitments rather than financial performance alone. We suggest that their actions are related to employee and community friendly policies. We find that family businesses do downsize less irrespective of financial performance considerations. However, their actions are not related to their employee or community friendly practices. The results raise issues related to the motivations of large multinationals to downsize and the drivers of their stakeholder management practices.",Downsizing; Family business; Stakeholder orientation,Personnel; Downsizing; Family business; Family firms; Financial performance; Normative commitments; Stakeholder management; Stakeholder orientations; Employment

This paper introduces a new conceptual framework that defines the testing process used in personnel selection and assessment as a communication exchange. Particular emphasis is placed on the medium that used to carry the test exchanged between a test administrator, broadly defined, and a test taker. Four attributes of the test administration medium (social bandwidth, interactivity, surveillance, and transparency) are described. By distinguishing the attributes of the medium from other elements of the assessment process, this framework may help researchers define, anticipate, and explain ""cross-mode"" equivalence. Also, HRM researchers who apply this framework may be able to provide specific suggestions as to how to effectively choose, design, and adapt personnel test administration media with key HRM concerns, goals, and outcomes such as reliability of measurement, construct and criterion validity, and test-taker reactions in mind.",Administration mode; Equivalence; Selection testing,Personnel; Personnel testing; Administration modes; Assessment process; Conceptual frameworks; Equivalence; Interactivity; Selection and assessments; Selection testing; Testing process; Personnel selection

Perhaps the most significant conceptual issue involves understanding how the central construct in this literature, the human resource system, affects firm performance outcomes. We argue that progress along these lines requires basic development and rethinking of the validity of the HR system construct. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the study of the HR system and firm performance relationship by addressing definitional and levels of analyses issues involved in conceptualizing and measuring the HR system construct. First, we briefly review the strategic HRM literature and identify five components of the HR system structure: HR principles, policies, programs, practices, and climate. Next we draw on organizational levels of analysis literature to identify specific measurement and conceptual issues involved in defining and measuring each of the HR system structure components. From this literature, we develop guidelines for researchers to answer questions about whom in the organization should provide information about the HR system construct, what types of data should be gathered, and how individual-level responses should be combined. Finally, we draw on the insights of the framework developed in the first two sections to address current and future issues in strategic HRM research including the debate over inter-rater reliability and understanding sources of variability in measures of HR system structure components.",Levels of analysis; Methodology; Strategic human resource management,Structured programming; Human resource practices; Individual levels; Inter-rater reliabilities; Levels of analysis; Methodology; Organizational levels; Sources of variability; Strategic human resource managements; Human resource management

Unfortunately, while strong and well-articulated arguments have been put forth on both sides, little empirical research has emerged to inform the debate. Moreover, there has been a lack of precision in the description of important differences in forced ranking systems that may influence both perceptions and the outcomes of those perceptions. In this paper, we isolate and describe four key elements (differentiation of rewards for top performers; consequences for low performers; frequency and consistency of feedback; and size of comparison group) distinguishing different forms of forced ranking in organizational contexts. We then report on a policy capturing study of 163 respondents that were asked to indicate the attractiveness of hypothetical company profiles representing the different combinations of force ranking system elements. Results indicated that all four elements were significant criteria used by respondents in making their decisions. Respondents were most inclined to find attractive those systems that had high differentiation of rewards, ""softer"" treatment of low performers, frequent and consistent feedback and large comparison groups - with the consequences for low performers nearly twice as influential as other factors. Males and those with high cognitive ability particularly favored high reward differentiation and males were also considerably less affected by the consequences for low performers.

Using panel data on a population of firms from 30 home countries investing in 64 host countries during the 1990s, we find evidence that the type of domestic experience affects the sensitivity of foreign entry decisions to host country political risk: the negative impact of political risk on the probability of entry is significantly smaller for firms that originate from countries themselves exhibiting higher risks of political expropriation, from countries that are more culturally distant and for firms with highly regulated domestic businesses.",,Population statistics; Risks; Home environment; Host countries; International investments; Panel data; Political risks; Strategic planning

Using a large sample of firms over several years, we find that highly leveraged firms tend to have lower social performance ratings in employee and product areas.",CSP; Leverage; Panel data,Leverage; Panel data; Social performance; Finance

Eighteen months after implementation of the Leadership Team, employee perceptions of work conditions, communications within the agency and labor-management relations have significantly improved. Archival data reveal increased productivity compared to a 4-year period prior to the implementation, and community satisfaction with police services have improved as well. In qualitative interviews, interviewees attribute these improvements to the changed management practices.

Business in Africa, however, is developing, in fits and starts, in tandem with the renewed focus on business and the economy through NEPAD . It is therefore imperative to begin to consider how differences in cultures within the African continent and across a globe which includes Africa will require the adaptation of Western business practices if the economic potential of the region is to be realised. Management of change programmes are often the vehicle for the wholesale introduction of Western practices into operations in other parts of the world. Balogun and her co-authors (1999) argue that, regardless of culture, organisations only change if the individuals within that organisation want to change, and, therefore, management needs to understand, support, and shape individual coping cycles. This study explores whether British and Kenyan employees of Barclays Africa differ in their perceptions of temporal relatedness and temporal dominance. Results show that Kenyans lack a perception of the future and have a strong perception of the past. These results suggest that Kenyans are, therefore, unlikely to follow a Western coping cycle.

This analysis separates practical measures of quality from cognitive measures of status. Results from survival analysis suggest that pragmatic legitimacy is a significant positive predictor of the likelihood of promotion. However, among all variables, affiliation with high status actors, a measure of cognitive legitimacy, is the strongest positive predictor of likelihood of career advancement (even when controlling for performance). Results also indicate that minorities advance at a slower rate regardless of actual performance.

Executive education experience is viewed from the point of view of identity dynamics, i.e. as an opportunity to stage identity experiments. To provide such an opportunity to participants, a program is seen as combining elements of liminal experience or transitional space. This paper, based on an exploratory study of a program at a leading business school, serves as a foundation for further exploration of both importance of different stages of an executive course for identity processes, and the role of various elements of an identity laboratory in participants' growth and development.

Building on ethnographic data gathered from the early stages of a global product development effort, trust is shown to be the variable outcome of the structuration of 'systemness,' a concept Giddens employs to characterize levels of social and system integration between actors. Specifically, systemness is disrupted when shifts in context require the organizations in a network to identify and adopt new roles relative to one another.

Although research on incentives and on formal organizational structure offer partial explanations for the difficulty of cross-divisional innovation, a deeper understanding of the problem requires research that simultaneously considers formal and informal structure. Unfortunately, such research faces two substantial methodological hurdles. First, the kind and quality of data that have typically been collected to conduct network analysis are inadequate; and second, there is a paucity of research that accounts for the embeddedness of the informal structure in the formal. In this paper, I begin to resolve these two issues. I argue for data collection methods relying on archives of intraorganizational e-mail data for network analysis. E-mail data are abundantly available - though difficult for researchers to procure - and represent substantially better measures of the social structure of the multi-divisional organization than alternative data sources. I also develop and pilot-test new measures that use e-mail data to quantify the relationships between formal divisions; in doing so, I explicitly link formal structure with informal structure. Together, these contributions of data collection and analysis promise to better equip future research to bridge the gap between formal structure and informal structure and, in doing so, to lay the groundwork for a fuller examination of the challenge of cross-divisional innovation from a network perspective.",Innovation; Research methods; Social networks,Electronic mail; Quality control; Social networking (online); Data collection; Data collection method; Data-sources; Embeddedness; Formal structures; Organizational structures; Quality of data; Social structure; Data acquisition

We test a theoretical model in which knowledge capability exerts a direct effect on strategic change; strategic change then influences firm performance. The environment moderates the relationship between strategic change and firm performance. The sample of the study includes the Major U.S. air carriers from 1972-1995. We operationalize knowledge capability as the education level and functional diversity of top management. Strategic change is measured as change in hub concentration, a key variable for the airlines. The data for the present study come from archival sources. Time series statistics with fixed effects are used to examine the relationships between the variables. The results support our theoretical model: knowledge capability influences change in strategy which, in turn, influences firm performance.

Specifically, I investigate the value creation of bank loans and how that value is moderated by lender reputation and potential conflicts of interest between the lender's securities underwriting and loan-making functions. Using an empirical specification that accounts for the endogeneity of lender selection, I find a strong positive association between lender reputation and the magnitude of the borrower stock price response to the public announcement of the loan, suggesting that better lenders create more firm value for their borrowers. In addition, when the borrower is a high volume issuer of debt or equity, I find that the borrower stock price response is higher if the lender does not act as a lead underwriter for one of the borrower's securities issues soon before or after the loan becomes public information. The implication for managers is that developing a relationship with the right financial intermediary is a key driver for building firm value.",,Bank loans; Endogeneity; High volumes; Potential conflict; Public information; Stock price; Strategic variables; Value creation; Financial markets

In this theoretical paper we examine this issue and make two claims. First, we argue that entrepreneurs in part create the social structure around them by selectively forming new ties or dissolving old ones. Second, we posit that entrepreneurs differ in their capability to form new ties or dissolve old ones - we label this networking style. We identify three elements of entrepreneurial networking style: spanning capacity, goal-orientedness and connecting capacity. We develop arguments relating these networking style elements to rates of tie formation and tie dissolution. We thus use the concept of networking styles to elaborate on how entrepreneurs partly shape the social structure in which they are embedded.",Entrepreneur attributes; Networking; Personal networks,Entrepreneur attributes; Network structures; Networking; Personal networks; Social structure; Dissolution

Drawing on management and political strategy literatures this is the first study that explicitly examines structural characteristics of industries and stakeholder relations. We examine how a firm's stakeholder relations are affected by five industry characteristics: regulation, concentration, industry rivalry, industry visibility and the manufacturing sector. Four stakeholder relations are of interest: employees, consumers, communities and the natural environment. Using 11,695 observations over 14 years, we compiled financial, stakeholder and industry data from Compustat, the Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini (KLD) Socrates database and the Bureau of Economic Analysis from 1991 to 2004. We modeled stakeholder strengths and stakeholder concerns separately resulting in eight regression models. We found all five industry characteristics significantly affect stakeholder relations. Firms in visible industries have limited stakeholder strengths. While interestingly, we found that regulations are not a panacea for stakeholder relations. Regulated industries had significantly more concerns in many, but not all, stakeholder relations while having significant stakeholder strengths. Firms in concentrated and manufacturing industries also had significant strengths and concerns in most stakeholder relations. Only industry rivalry had widespread impacts on all stakeholder relations. Industry rivalry encouraged significantly more strengths while limiting concerns with all stakeholder relations via 'virtuous circle' rivalry. Firms in industries with 'race to the bottom' rivalry, on the other hand, had significantly more concerns across all stakeholder relations.",'race to the bottom' rivalry; 'virtuous circle' rivalry; Corporate social responsibility (CSR),Economic analysis; Manufacture; Public utilities; Regression analysis; 'race to the bottom' rivalries; 'virtuous circle' rivalries; Bureau of Economic Analysis; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Industry characteristics; Manufacturing industries; Natural environments; Structural characteristics; Economic and social effects

However, there has been little research into how both sets of individuals perceive value in these relationships (Costabile, 2003). To address this gap in the literature, we conducted exploratory, qualitative research that examined the consultant-client relationship from the perspective of both individuals. In-depth interviews were conducted with three consultants from a management consulting firm and seven individuals with whom they had interpersonal consultant-client relationships. Interviews were also conducted with four consultants from an engineering consulting firm and nine of their clients. Some consultants were interviewed about more than one client; thus there were interview data for a total of 16 consultant-client dyads. Thematic analysis of the data revealed, for both types of consulting firm, that the consultants and clients alike identified four major benefits from a long term relationship: (1) Business benefits (2) Individual and organizational learning (3) Enjoyment from the interactions, and (4) Friendship. However, both individuals in a consultant-client dyad were more likely to report positive perceptions of the relationship if they both reported friendship as a benefit, regardless of length of their relationship. The implications of this study are that professional relationships between individual consultants and clients can have a range of benefits beyond the obvious commercial ones. However, these benefits are not fully realised simply because the consultant works for a client over a period of time. Some practical suggestions for extracting the most from a consultant-client relationship are discussed and future research directions are proposed.",,Engineering consulting; Future research directions; Long-term relationships; Management consultants; Management consulting; Organizational learning; Professional relationships; Professional services

Using transaction cost theory, we argue that transactional debt (i.e., public securities such as bonds) provides market governance, while relational debt (i.e., private loans from banks and insurance companies) provides hierarchical governance. Although market governance is the more efficient alternative for generic investments, firm-specific investments such as R&D require hierarchical governance. Analyzing a large sample of Japanese firms over a twenty year period of deregulation, we investigate both whether firms align their debt structure with their R&D strategies, as well as the performance implications of misalignment. Consistent with theory, we find that R&D intensive firms that relied more heavily on relational debt outperformed those that relied more heavily on transactional debt. Furthermore, R&D intensive firms increased their reliance on relational debt, although this adjustment occurred only during the latter phase of deregulation when most firms obtained access to transactional debt.",,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Insurance; Capital structure; Firm Performance; Hierarchical governance; Insurance companies; Japanese firms; Public security; Specific investment; Transaction-cost theory; Investments

Role models are important in early career, as individuals develop their work identity, but recent research suggests this may be so at middle and late career stages in their contribution to role transitions, and affirmation of work identity. Recent role model literature has looked at the construal process (the how of role modelling) and also at who and for what role models are being used. However, there appears to be no literature to explain why role models at a senior level are so important. This paper is a review of the literature on role models, from a social identity theory perspective, taking into account the contextual organisational demographics. It is conducted as part of research considering the lack of senior female role models in U.K. corporations and the importance of this in terms of the career identity and aspirations of female managers the why of role model importance.",Career progression; Role models; Work identity,Career progression; Middle management; Organisational; Recent researches; Role model; Social identity theories; Women's careers; Work identity

We classify firms according to the level of industry clustering in their location. The central questions are whether de novo firms in cluster and in non-cluster locations experience different chances of survival? If they do, what are the locational and firm specific characteristics associated with survival of de novo firms that differentiate cluster and non-cluster firms? Controlling for initial and current profiles of resources and capabilities we find that initial endowment of resources of de novo entrants provides a safety net for a longer period of time, and a higher survival rates in clusters. Findings also suggest that different strategies enhance enterprise survival in clusters and isolation.",Clusters; De novo entrants; Survival,Clusters; Current profile; De novo entrants; Manufacturing sector; Resources and capabilities; Safety nets; Survival; Survival rate; Location

In order to understand the role that organizational learning processes, experience with adaptation and customization, and managerial focus all play in the evolution of product development capabilities over time, this paper empirically investigates questions related to why some firms are able to produce better products than others. We find that firms building up experience in both general product development processes and in specific customizations of those processes for new product market spaces are at an advantage versus firms with little breadth and experience, though the nature of that advantage is complex and contingent on the specific characteristics of the focal new products. We also find that firms exhibit an ability to focus their product development activities in any given period in order to achieve improved results, providing a potential path for small firms to follow in their efforts to grow their product portfolio and, as a result, expand their experience in both static and dynamic product development processes.",Dynamic capabilities; Organizational learning; Product development,Enterprise resource management; Financial data processing; Investments; Knowledge management; Dynamic capabilites; Dynamic capabilities; Dynamic product development; Organizational learning; Product development activities; Product development process; Product portfolio management; Product portfolios; Product development
An attributional theory of convergent thinking in groups,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087222984&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2006.22898583&partnerID=40&md5=fbe3e33952523d7437c7b113e8495a48,"Classic research on attribution theory suggests that groups are biased toward attributing their success to factors that are internal to their group. However, the existing research has confounded two types of attributions that are both internal to the group, but theoretically distinct: (1) Attributions that differentiate between the contributions made by each individual group member and (2) Attributions that focus on the group as a whole. This dichotomy is important because different types of attributions may have different consequences for convergent thinking in groups (Goncalo, 2004). This prediction was tested in an experiment in which groups explored alternative courses of action prior to making a shared decision. The results showed that attribution for past success focused on the group as a whole caused groups to consider fewer alternatives and less divergent alternatives. These findings suggest that the group serving bias may have important consequences for group performance that have not yet been considered in current research.",,Convergent thinkings; Group members; Group performance

S. populace. The U. S. Census Bureau (2002) projected that by 2025, white non-Hispanic Americans will comprise 62% and minority Americans 38% of the U. S. population. Business students need to be able to work effectively with others of different backgrounds ethnicities and values. Interaction with minority faculty helps students develop this competency. Recent surveys indicate that business school leaders and students realize the positive benefits minority faculty bring to the learning experience. However U. S.-born minority faculty are underrepresented in AACSB business schools relative to their representation in the U. S. population. Theoretical explanations for lagging minority faculty representation have been advanced but have received little empirical attention. Six of these theories argue that low minority representation is due to a lack of diversity sensitivity on the part of educational leaders, discrimination the (small) pipeline of qualified minority faculty, equal opportunity theory, rational person economic theory, and low institutional diversity strategic priority. These six arguments are explored and tested in U. S. business schools. Results indicated that leader racial awareness, perceived importance of cultural change, recruitment and feedback efforts predicted minority faculty representation at U. S. business schools. Salary levels were associated with minority representation but the direction of the relationship did not support our hypothesis.

Steps towards a theory of institutional stability and change as dialectically related opposites,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088000335&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2006.27175652&partnerID=40&md5=6876d644ee3af771de14cfee76b01f6e,"This paper argues that recent attempts to transform and/or extend new institutional theory to explain institutional change fail to overcome new institutionalism's limited capacity to deal with the question of change for two reasons. First, there is a tendency to preserve the dualism of structural constraint and free agency. Second, they tend to rely on functionalist explanations to account for institutional change. It is argued that a social constructionist theory of institutional change that frames institutional stability and change as dialectically related opposites has the potential to overcome these two significant shortcomings. Mainly drawing upon Berger & Luckmann (1967)'s seminal account of social constructionism, which paradoxically forms an important part of new institutional theory's microsociological underpinnings, the paper identifies and explores 10 sources of institutional stability. These sources are developed into a proposition framework for institutional stability analysis that can be used to explore questions of institutional change. The application of this framework to the everyday example of 'queuing' is used to illustrate the paper's main contention that it is through stability analysis that specific institutional change sequences can be better understood.",Institutional change; Institutional stability; Institutional Theory,Functionalist explanations; Institutional change; Institutional stabilities; Institutional theory; New Institutional Theory; Social constructionism; Stability analysis; Structural constraints; Stability

Yet most of this worked has not focused on challenging underlying assumptions that help to reproduce problems associated with differences in the workplace. As a result, the theoretical development, and societal impact of diversity research by organizational scholars has been rather limited in scope. It is the premise of this essay that more critical or challenging stances still need to be applied that question the underlying assumptions of research on diversity, particularly among US management scholars. This paper includes an overview of the dominant perspectives and arguments about diversity in organizational studies, particularly in organizational behavior with a more critical lens applied to some of the more recent reviews of work in the field. The particular focus here is on how the texts and language produced in the organizational literature on diversity are engaged in a politics of representation that keeps organizations separate and inequitable, despite the rhetoric of ""valuing' differences. This approach is adopted to introduce new questions that need to be addressed if we are to seriously approach diversity issues in management research and transform our prior understandings of what constitutes knowledge, theory, and practice in organization studies.",Critical management; Discourse; Diversity,Discourse; Diversity; Management research; Organization studies; Organizational behavior; Organizational literature; Organizational studies; Theoretical development; Economic and social effects

This paper investigates firm performance in industries where rapid changes are accompanied by the emergence of new technological sub-fields and market segments. We re-examine first mover advantage (FMA) by adopting a dynamic, evolutionary conceptualization of first movers, and in the context of the technological 'play' of the product being launched. In the empirical setting of the disk drive industry during 1977-1997, we show that a firm's technological capability has crucial implications on the outcome of its market pioneering efforts. We demonstrate that while pioneering elevates survival rates when a firm is a technology leader, such early to market strategies hurt when the technological performance of the product is below a certain minimum level. Until a firm accomplishes this minimum of technological play in the product, a firm is better off delaying entry even in product markets that have very short life-cycles.",,Commerce; Corporate entrepreneurship; Exploration and exploitation; First mover advantages; Market strategies; Moderating effect; Strategic renewal; Technological capability; Technological performance; Life cycle

We present the findings of three empirical studies focused on systematic and progressive refinement and validation of a measure of interpersonal trust aligned with this framework. Factor analysis and comparative analyses reported in study 1 show that the three constructs are distinct. However, comparative analyses of responses across contexts revealed that the calculus-based measure was not a form of trust. Furthermore, an additional affect-based trust construct was identified. Factor analysis and invariance test results reported in Study 2 highlight the robustness of knowledge-based, identification-based and affect-based trust measures across three distinct relational settings-trust between coworkers, trust of supervisors in subordinates, and trust of employees in their supervisors. Evidence from longitudinal research, reported in Study 3, shows that trust develops within relationships over time and that the three trust constructs differentially predict trust outcomes. While knowledge-based trust uniquely predicted influence tactic use, all three forms of trust predicted task assistance and reliance, and affect-based trust predicted socio-emotional support provision and self-disclosure. Taken together, the findings across three empirical studies, conducted with very different samples and methodologies, highlight the strength of a new set of measures for empirical work based upon Lewicki and Bunker's developmental theory of trust.",Lewicki; Relationship; Trust,Calculations; Knowledge based systems; Multivariant analysis; Supervisory personnel; Comparative analysis; Conceptual frameworks; Interpersonal relationship; Lewicki; Longitudinal research; Progressive refinement; Relationship; Trust; Factor analysis

A cross-national comparison supports the hypothesis that the entrepreneurs' corrupt behavior is shaped by both formal (economic and legal rules or organizations) and informal institutions (culturally embedded codes of conduct, norms and values). Minimizing transaction costs seems to play a crucial role for becoming engaged in corruption. The higher costs associated with protecting the property rights, enforcing legal decisions, or simply interpreting business laws and regulations, the higher the entrepreneur's willingness to pay bribes. Similarly, the inadequacy of financial institutions in assisting entrepreneurship results in higher willingness of engaging in corruption. On the other hand, also informal institutions matter. More specifically, the entrepreneur's embeddedness in ""closed"" (business) networks (with friends, kin, and national bureaucrats) nurtures corrupt deals. Furthermore, business ethics governed by the principle if ""others behave illegally, so can I"" establish breeding grounds for corruption.",Corruption; East-West comparison; Entrepreneurship,Crime; Economics; Business environments; Corruption; East-west comparisons; Emerging markets; Entrepreneurship; Financial institution; Laws and regulations; Willingness to pay; Costs

This study argues that the profitenhancing effects of MMC's short-term collusive outcomes are more than offset in the long-term by the performance-depleting convergence of MMC's intra-firm and population-level consequences. At the firm level, rivalry reduction, mimicry, and myopia deriving from multimarket contact mediate competency depletion over time by decreasing problemistic search, increasing path dependence, reducing competitive experience, inducing mimetic isomorphism, promoting macrocultures, and locking the firm into foothold commitments. At the population level, multimarket contact destabilizes concentration levels, generating patterns of 'punctuated forbearance' in which flurries of intense rivalry interrupt extended periods of tacit collusion. The confluence of firm-level competence depletion and population-level punctuated forbearance, I conclude, undermines long-term firm performance. Punctuated forbearance ultimately exposes the very competence depletion which it largely drives and from which it partially derives.",Competence depletion; Multimarket contact,Competence depletion; Concentration levels; Firm Performance; Increasing paths; Multi-market contacts; Multiple markets; Population levels; Tacit collusion; Locks (fasteners)

This study examines the effect of firms' IP policies on employees' territorial behaviors around knowledge. In a scenario-based experimental study, we find that knowledge workers perceive certain IP policies as infringement of their own knowledge territory.

Social embeddedness theory suggests that if client-agency relationships are embedded in top managers' social relations then the exit of top managers should increase the likelihood of their dissolution. However, previous research on advertising agencies has failed to find empirical support for this prediction, casting doubt on social embeddedness arguments. We investigate executive mobility and market tie dissolutions in samples of advertisers and advertising agencies and find support for social embeddedness but not always in the ways predicted by previous research. For advertisers, the dissolution of market ties depends not on the exit of executives but by how executive vacancies are filled. For advertisers, the exit of incumbents and internal succession weaken market ties, but these effects depend on the size and strategy of advertising agencies. We discuss the implications of these findings for social embeddedness theory and research on market ties and executive mobility.",Market ties; Mobility; Social embeddedness,Carrier mobility; Dissolution; Managers; Marketing; Advertising agency; Executive mobilities; Market ties; Social embeddedness; Social relations; Top managers; Commerce

While there is a natural reluctance to report the actual status of a troubled project, doing so is sometimes the only way that the project can be brought to senior management's attention so that corrective actions can be taken to successfully turn the project around if possible, or abandon it if necessary. Prior research has suggested that the ability to save face and time pressure are two variables that may impact bad news reporting. In this paper, we examine the effect that a blame shifting opportunity (as a mechanism for saving face) has on an individual's assessment of whether a troubled project's status ought to be reported and on that individual's willingness to report. We also examine the effect that perceived time urgency has on all three constructs in the basic whistle-blowing model adapted from Dozier and Miceli (1985). Based on the results of a controlled laboratory experiment, we find that both blame shifting and time urgency are important factors affecting an individual's willingness to report bad news. Blame shifting exerts both direct and indirect influence on willingness to report bad news, while time urgency was found only to exert an indirect influence on willingness to report bad news. The implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.",MUM effect; Software project management; Whistle blowing,Controlled laboratories; Corrective actions; Effect of time; Mum effects; News reporting; Senior management; Software project management; Time pressures; Project management

Managers who had higher levels of work enjoyment received higher performance ratings. Drive, the compulsion to work hard due to inner pressures, moderated the effect of work enjoyment on performance. When drive was low, work enjoyment was positively related to performance; performance ratings increased as work enjoyment increased. When managers were highly driven, however, work enjoyment was not related to performance. Excessive drive seemed to interfere with the performance-enhancing aspects of work enjoyment.

This theory further suggests a blending process. Pre-founding experience in non-local populations leads founders to establish organizations with the novel forms. When these founders also have pre-founding experience in the local population, their new organizations tend to perform better. This facilitates the establishment and persistence of the new organizational form. We evaluate these predictions in an analysis of a major transformation of the population of Israeli wineries. Between 1982 and 2003, the population of Israeli wine producers grew from just five to more than 100. This explosion in numbers coincided with a shift toward non-kosher wine production. Although the four largest Israeli producers in 1982 were kosher, roughly eighty percent of the new entrants were established as non-kosher producers. After arguing that kosher versus non-kosher wine production represent two distinct organizational forms separated (at least initially) by strong form boundaries, we analyze how the novel non-kosher organizational form successfully invaded the local population of kosher producers. Our results attest to the joint effect of local and non-local pre-founding experience, and thus corroborate our theory of form invasion.",,Blending; Breweries; Blending process; Form changes; Industry experience; Local populations; New organizational forms; Organizational forms; Wine industry; Wine production; Wine

To a great extent this new way of working has been made possible by electronic communication technology. Yet even while managers are leveraging electronic communication technology to gain access to new knowledge and to enable new team configurations, they are concerned about the knowledge acquisition of distributed team members who interact primarily via electronic communication. The objective of this study is to deepen our understanding of the relationship of electronic communication technology use and team configuration with knowledge access in distributed teams. We do so by examining the communication networks of individuals in distributed teams, and the relationship of team configuration on those networks. We extend prior work on social networks and propose that individuals in distributed teams have two distinct communication networks that influence knowledge access: face-to-face and electronic networks. We find that these two networks differentially influence an individual's level of knowledge access from team members. In addition, we find that the relationship of each of these networks with knowledge access level is influenced by how the team is physically configured and the size of the team. These findings suggest that achieving higher knowledge access levels in distributed teams is more complex than just increasing electronic and face-to-face communication. Rather it involves understanding how communication patterns, communication mode and team configuration interact to influence the level of knowledge access for each individual in the team.",Computer-mediated communication; Distributed work; Social networks,Human resource management; Knowledge management; Social networking (online); Communication pattern; Computer mediated communication; Distributed work; Electronic communications; Electronic networks; Face-to-face communications; Geographically distributed teams; Team configuration; Distributed computer systems

In particular, it focuses on how attracting the external resources required to build value can conflict with entrepreneurs' abilities to keep control of their ventures at the CEO and board levels. It explores whether this tension exists both at the level of the individual entrepreneur's financial gains and at the level of the overall venture's value, and also whether entrepreneurs can avoid the tradeoff by building more human capital before founding the venture and by retaining more co-founders as the venture grows. It tests its hypotheses on a unique dataset of 457 private technology ventures, and finds strong support for each of its core propositions. Implications include the need for entrepreneurs to understand the small probability of achieving both the profit and control motives, and to examine their core motivation and proactively plan their strategic choices to achieve that motivation.",Entrepreneur; Strategic choice,Profitability; Statistical tests; Board-level; Entrepreneur; External resources; Financial gains; Human capitals; New ventures; Strategic choice; Technology ventures; Motivation

Less well understood are the positive externalities of social structure, a viewpoint on social structure as a public good. This paper concerns how some 1800 professional service employees -bankers - operating in a large investment bank cooperate and add value to one another in the course of everyday work. The main question we ask is whether social structure can help explain why some employees are better able than others to add value to their peers, as rated by their peers. Our theoretical contribution concerns the distinct influences of two orders of social capital: first-order and second-order. First-order social capital is conceptualized as the social structure of the focal actor. Second-order social capital is conceptualized as the social structure of the actor's boss, a central figure in the life of most managers. Our concern, then, is with two complementary externalities of social structure: the focal actor's and his/her boss's. Using network sparseness to capture social capital, we find that both first-order and second-order social capital have a significant effect on how much value an employee adds to others. Thus, we document not only how an actor's social capital might also act as a public good, increasing the value the actor adds to others, but also how in this capacity, the actor can further benefit from the social capital of the boss, a prominent contact.",Networks; Social capital,Investments; Networks (circuits); Personnel; Career advancement; First order; Investment bank; Professional services; Public goods; Second orders; Social capitals; Social structure; Economics

In 2005, the Department of Defense (DoD) expected to spend billions of dollars on an expensive and risky undertaking-the transformation of DoD. In this study I refer to that transformation as planned organizational change and explore the experiences of two groups of stakeholders: planners/implementers and contributors/recipients. Three concepts-stakeholder, planned change, and sensemaking-provide the theoretical framework. The research question is: How do internal stakeholders in Federal defense organizations experience and make sense of planned organizational change? This phenomenographic (Marton, 1981, 2000) study explores the different ways in which these stakeholders experience, conceptualize, and make sense of planned organizational change. Weick's seven properties of sensemaking (1995; 2001) help reveal the meaning aspect of their experiences. Conceptions about the philosophy of the change experience range from ""It's the right thing to do"" to ""It's the banner of the moment"" to ""It's political."" A key finding is the variation in the support for participants' sensemaking, where members of the planner/implementer stakeholder group indicated more support for their sensemaking than the contributor/recipient stakeholder group. Four variations in stakeholders' experience of planned organizational change emerged. These variations, or categories of description, are: aligned, conflicted, disillusioned, and dysfunctional. These are presented in an empirical typology or outcome space. Finally, this study adds to the collective understanding of the human element of organizational transformation by presenting a model of how internal stakeholder experience planned organizational change.",Phenomenography; Planned organizational change; Sensemaking,Department of Defense; Organizational change; Organizational transformation; Phenomenography; Research questions; Sensemaking; Stakeholder groups; Theoretical framework; Network security
Facilitating learning from front-line failures,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087583901&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2006.27175174&partnerID=40&md5=4e853b9389b01d8a103c86c936e1b5cb,"This paper investigates the conditions under which front-line employees are more likely to attempt organizational learning from work system failures. Drawing on organizational behavior and quality improvement literatures, we develop a framework of front-line problem-solving, which is tested using survey data from employees and managers from 48 different work units. We also present observational data from four of these units. We find that psychological safety-the belief that one can talk about one's own or others' errors without risk of punishment-and problem solving efficacy-the belief that the organization will respond positively to employees' suggestions on system improvements-was correlated with work units' levels of front-line problem-solving activities, which in turn was associated with employee satisfaction. Surprisingly, individuals felt responsibility was not associated with front-line problem-solving. These findings suggest that rather than relying on hiring motivated individuals, managers instead need to create an environment that fosters employees' efforts to improve their work systems. To create such an environment managers must ensure that employees have sufficient time to engage in improvement efforts, create a work culture where it is safe to talk about work system problems and follow through on employee communications. Doing so can result in improved work processes and ultimately, better outcomes.",,Managers; Systems engineering; Employee communication; Employee satisfaction; Front line employees; Organizational behavior; Organizational learning; Psychological safety; Quality improvement; System improvements; Human resource management

We examine this issue and suggest that contracting and competitive environments facing research-intensive firms will determine the level of liquid assets held by the firm. Specifically, we suggest that a firm's research & development investments positively predict the level of its liquid asset holdings. This is due to the fact that invention-induced knowledge asymmetries increase the firm's cost of accessing external liquid capital. However, we also find that patent production and top manager ownership provide important signaling mechanisms which reduce knowledge asymmetries between the firm and capital markets, and consequently lower the firm's need to hold liquid assets. Empirical tests were conducted using a sample of 105 U.S.-based biotechnology firms.",,Managers; Patents and inventions; Biotechnology firms; Competitive environment; Development investment; Empirical test; Liquid asset; Signaling mechanisms; Top managers; Liquids

Connecting signaling theory to the role of information asymmetry in pricing of IPOs it has been argued that the appropriate signals from the entrepreneur can in turn limit the underpricing of a stock. Prior research has not always given clear indications whether managers can send signals that effect underpricing. This research employs finer grained methods and finds that entrepreneur's ownership as a signal of value perceived in the firm can limit underpricing. However, this occurs only to a certain level. After the entrepreneur's ownership reaches too high a level, its impact on underpricing becomes positive, underpricing increases. This research also presents evidence that business angels, as distinct from venture capitalists, are a signal that helps to reduce underpricing. The impact of these findings on practice and future research are detailed in the manuscript.",,Business angels; Expected values; Information asymmetry; Signaling theory; Social capitals; Venture capitalists; Navigation

Moreover, those that are most innovative combine the two, and search early and late. We also find that early movers are especially innovative when their competitors are slow to catch up. In contrast, late movers are especially innovative when they wait to learn from competitors what not to do, yet move fast enough before all opportunities are exploited. The results also show that the effects of timing vary with organizational form: focused firms are successful when they search early, and diversified firms when they search late.

We address these debates by building a formal model in which the extent of diversification is endogenous and affects both market structure and firms' competitiveness. Our model elucidates the interdependent impact of structure and relatedness on performance. We find a non-monotonic effect of relatedness on performance: while greater relatedness increases the competitiveness of diversified firms, it can also spur additional diversification, thereby eroding market structure and performance. We use the model to generate data and show how the negative effect of relatedness on market structure can give rise to a spurious inference of a diversification discount in cross-sectional regressions.",Diversification discount; Formal foundations of strategy; Industry relatedness,Commerce; Corporate diversification; Cross-sectional regression; Diversification discounts; Empirical literature; Formal foundations of strategies; Industry relatedness; Market structures; Market-relatedness; Competition

It is often posited that changing actors' mental representations can enhance strategic adaptation and responsiveness. However, this area of study is fragmented and lacks a unifying theoretical framework. To redress these limitations, we develop a theory of how techniques such as cognitive mapping can achieve appropriate changes in managers' mental representations. Our theory outlines three sequenced processes and corresponding outcomes that are integral to successful cognitive change: differentiation, integration, and coherence of knowledge. We analyze the representational and processing characteristics of differentiated, integrated, and coherent knowledge, and the psychological mechanisms by which this can be attained with intervention techniques used by management researchers and practitioners. We synthesize theory and research from cognitive psychology concerning how mental representations (including categories, schemata, and mental models) and information processing (specifically the functions of working memory and dual processing) influence problem solving and decision making with research from behavioral decision theory and managerial cognition. In doing so, we explicate how several limitations and biases afflicting strategic thinking can be overcome based on the principles of differentiation, integration, and coherence. Propositions predict the specific benefits these provide for managerial decision making and problem solving, including improved usage of information relevant to a problem, the development of richer and more effective mental models, and the minimization of errors and biases in strategic thinking.",Cognitive map; Coherence; Differentiation; Integration; Strategic intervention,Behavioral research; Cognitive systems; Coherent light; Decision theory; Differentiation (calculus); Integration; Managers; Cognitive maps; Managerial cognitions; Managerial decision making; Mental representations; Strategic activities; Strategic adaptations; Strategic interventions; Theoretical framework; Decision making

Transferring the well established patent system from the manufacturing sector to the service sector may be a possible solution but that, on the other hand, raises some major problems. First, patents can only be applied for new technical solutions; therefore the international patent classification does not provide any service categories. Thus, only the service companies whose products have a technological base can protect their innovations by using patents. Furthermore, since a central driving force for innovations in the service sector is the recent development of information and communication technologies, patent activities tend to cluster and grow more rapidly in this field. Other kinds of patents are rarely found in service firms. Consequently, traditional protection mechanisms like patents cannot be obtained for most innovation activities of service companies.

This question is at the core of first-mover theory, yet has remained unanswered due to inconclusive or contradicting results. I argue that the firm's technical, market, and manufacturing knowledge are crucial determinants of the firm's market entry timing and that firms endowed with these types of knowledge are more likely to be earlier product market entrants. The research setting is the semiconductor industry, where I analyze 53 international firms and their entry in 12 product generations. Results reconcile the contradictory findings so far: while I find broad support for the hypothesized facilitating factors, the interactions between these knowledge types impede an early product market entry.",,Knowledge based systems; Semiconductor device manufacture; Timing circuits; Entry timing; International firms; Knowledge base; Knowledge types; Manufacturing knowledge; Product generation; Product markets; Semiconductor industry; Commerce

The temporal dynamics of the divestiture process,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085399549&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2006.27169714&partnerID=40&md5=2be8acd3e7e17468a3e44c2a29afa63b,"Despite their major theoretical and practical relevance, the temporal dynamics of the divestiture process - including aspects such as the starting and ending point of the divestiture process, the timing of divestiture announcements, the lag between divestiture announcement and operative actions, the unfolding of these actions, and the importance of different time views (objective vs. subjective) more generally - have remained unexplored. The longitudinal, event-based study of how Siemens, Europe's largest electronics' company, divested its semiconductor business and two other electronic components' units in the late 1990s addresses this broad set of unresolved issues. Specifically, the paper unravels the starting and ending point of the divestiture process and highlights potential determinants both for the starting point (e.g., capital market's subjective time view) of the process and for the timing of the actual announcement of the divestiture decision. Moreover, the paper documents the different stages in the unfolding of the divestiture process. It unravels the lags and sequence in which actions occur and outlines how different ""time clocks"" and subjective time views impact on the entire process. Thereby, the current paper contributes to extant research by a.) revisiting and revising taken for granted assumptions on the temporal dynamics of divestitures (e.g., its starting and ending point), b.) by extending current knowledge in respect to the timing of divestiture announcements, c.) by acknowledging not only the importance of objective but also subjective time views, and d.) by generating new insights into the unfolding, sequencing and timing of multiple divestitures.",,Different stages; Electronic component; Event-based; Paper documents; Semiconductor business; Siemens; Temporal dynamics; Dynamics

This approach contributes to answering three key questions for firms considering political involvement, namely whether to get involved or to be a free-rider, when to get involved (before barriers are erected by rivals) and how to benefit from CPA (by raising barriers).

Radical departure from such patterns is infrequent, yet sometimes necessary to enable improved organizational performance and survival. Research on radical organizational change has often either focused on the occurrence of large simultaneous changes in various organizational dimensions, treating them collectively as a single transformational event, or studied in depth a specific type of radical change without incorporating the occurrence of and interrelationships with other proximate radical organizational changes. In this study, we treat key types of radical change as separate yet interrelated events, rather than as subsumed parts of single events or as isolated from other organizational changes. We examine key factors that increase the chances that organizations will accomplish two high-impact types of radical organizational change-strategic and structural-and examine the performance consequences of each type of change. Our analysis of a sample of bank holding companies over two decades suggests that: (1) radical structural change occurs more frequently than radical strategic change; and (2) radical strategic change increases the likelihood that radical structural change will follow, but not vice versa. We also found that sustained low performance and the replacement of a top executive by an outsider facilitate the occurrence of radical strategic, but not that of structural change. We found that the effects of both types of change on firm profitability and survival were generally not significant. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research on organizational change.",,Firm profitabilities; Holding company; Organizational change; Organizational dimensions; Organizational performance; Stable strategies; Strategic changes; Top executive; Strategic planning

We find that these communities' members integrated organizing practices in ways that enhanced organizational sustainability but also supported espoused goals of reflecting members' interests. However, members rejected practices that violated their mission and norms. Members could not reconcile all practices to mutual satisfaction, so these practices remain contested. This research specifies how organizational innovation unfolds through members' consideration of competing logics and demonstrates how formal organizing practices can support rather than transform goals.",Logics; New organizational forms; Social movements,Ethnographic study; Logics; New organizational forms; Organizational forms; Organizational innovation; Selective synthesis; Social groups; Social movements

We find evidence for two clusters of stakeholder groups, each using different tactics and targeting different populations of firms.

This paper presents the first formal examination of this connection. I provide a precise distinction between the intrinsic, or potential, level of causal ambiguity associated with a particular strategy and the actual level that obtains in equilibrium. I find that intrinsic ambiguity is a necessary but, contrary to the speculation of some, insufficient condition for a sustained capability-based advantage. Most importantly, I also find that the complexity of the network of causal relations induced by a firm's strategy is not positively correlated with its intrinsic level of ambiguity. This contradicts earlier conjectures that have found their way into mainstream thinking.",Causal ambiguity; Competitive advantage; Learning,Competition; Causal ambiguity; Causal relations; Competitive advantage; Intrinsic ambiguities; Learning; Operating complexity; Complex networks

Despite the importance of strategic partnerships, however, the process by which social capital accumulates and contributes to performance improvements is not well understood. Drawing on information processing theory, we develop a model linking increased relational embeddedness, established through buyer and supplier commitments to a strategic relationship, to subsequent improvements in relationship performance. Furthermore, we hypothesize that structural embeddedness, as reflected in levels of formal impersonal communication, and formal and informal managerial and technical communication is positively related to relational performance improvements. We consider the ability of these various forms of communication to address the need for uncertainty and equivocality reduction in the relationship. Using data provided by 111 procurement executives from the United Kingdom, we find support for many of our hypotheses.

Moreover, these structural positions in the social networks of affect-intensive relations were systematically related to individual work performance; prominence in the network of friendship ties was associated with higher workplace performance, whereas a larger number of negative relations had a negative effect on performance.

Qualitative data collected from over ninety percent of investment and senior support staff at a small private equity firm reveal that individuals use wireless email devices to maintain a constant connection to organizational life. The opportunity to monitor incoming messages enables a sense of control over the pace and substance of information flow while the specific properties of wireless email devices provide an opportunity to control the potential interruption of incoming communication. These opportunities encourage a compulsive checking of email that is shared by users and framed as individual choice. For this population, the individual experience of carrying wireless email devices increases mobility and provides perceived moment by moment stress relief. It also makes disengaging from work difficult and may increase long term stress. Emerging group norms help explain these discrepancies. Norms reveal implicit expectations of availability and responsiveness that are in direct contrast to espoused firm values. Thus an entire firm carrying a device which facilitates 'unobtrusive' access to email may unwittingly create shared patterns of use that become a self reinforcing cycle of constant communication.",Email; Mobile technology; Organizational communication,Investments; Stress relief; Individual choice; Information flows; Mobile Technology; Organizational communication; Organizational context; Private equity firms; Social environment; Specific properties; Electronic mail

When exploration backfires: Unintended consequences of multi-level organizational search,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086490324&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2006.22894851&partnerID=40&md5=e1411305b5d2e55ace291debf1aa6f3a,"An enduring belief among management scholars and managers is that unleashing the low-level members of an organization to explore extensively will broaden the exploration conducted by the organization as a whole. Using an agent-based simulation model, we show that in multi-level organizations, increased exploration at lower levels can backfire, reducing overall exploration and diminishing organizational performance in environments that require broad search. This result arises when interdependencies cut across the domains of low-level department managers. In the absence of cross-department interdependencies, more extensive exploration at low levels can improve the performance of the firm as a whole. Our findings show that careful attention to information processing in multi-level organizations can shed light on whether, and when, decentralization encourages innovation.",Exploration; Multi-level organization; Simulation,Natural resources exploration; Agent-based simulation models; Department managers; Extensive explorations; Multi-level organizations; Organizational performance; Organizational searches; Simulation; Unintended consequences; Managers
Determinants of internship effectiveness: An exploratory model,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085399450&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2006.22898555&partnerID=40&md5=98fba1bc291ba799b15aa341e703b7f9,"Recent critics have called into question the effectiveness of business schools for creating knowledge that impacts practice. While these comments have focused on a range of activities, they have not considered the transfer of knowledge via student employment, such as through an internship program. Despite their growing popularity surprisingly little is known about internship effectiveness. Particularly, research has not considered the role the three primary actors - student, university and business - have in making an effective internship, nor has it often considered more than one performance outcome. To explore determinants of internship effectiveness, this paper draws from the extant literature on internships and on technology transfer and proposes a multi-stage model. The stages of the model are: inputs to the internship, process of the internship, initial outcome of student learning, and final outcomes of project implementation and student satisfaction. The relationships among the stages are evaluated using data collected on Portuguese internships. The findings reveal two separate sets of relationships. In the first, project selection and awareness lead to project progress and implementation. In the second, university studies leads to student learning and advisor selection leads to the faculty advisor's role in the internship, and each of these then leads to student satisfaction. The distinct set of relationships indicates that internships should be evaluated on multiple dimensions and investigators should consider multiple determinants. The paper discusses the implications for future research into internships and for actions that students, the universities and businesses can take in designing internships.",Effectiveness; Internship; Portugal,Knowledge management; Technology transfer; Effectiveness; Implications for futures; Internship; Multi stage modeling; Portugal; Project implementation; Student satisfaction; Transfer of knowledge; Students

We integrate identity theory research from organizational behavior with literature on board monitoring and resource provision to model how directors' multiple role identities can affect their behavior. We propose directors' multiple role identities and the strength of identification with each role affects the extent to which they engage in monitoring and resource provision. Specifically we propose directors' strength of identification with the organization, director and shareholder roles has a positive relationship with both board monitoring and resource provision. Directors' identification with his/her CEO role, however, is positively related to resource provision yet negatively related to monitoring. Further, director identification with the stakeholder role has a positive relationship with monitoring but an inverted-U relationship to resource provision.

Data from 5,894 organizations in 16 countries have been obtained for this study, using the database of CRANET (Cross-country HRM research). Data on cultural values were taken from the GLOBE (Global Leadership and Organizational Effectiveness) study and assigned to organizations respectively. Results showed that national values explained training indicators, confirming all study hypotheses. Generally, values such as low power distance, high future orientation, and high uncertainty avoidance explained increased investment in training. High collectivism explained higher emphasis on organizational needs and low emphasis on personal needs. Organizational characteristics were also related to training: large organizations in high technology tended to invest in training more than their small-size and lowtechnology counterparts. The direction of the effect of sector on training was inconclusive. All three organizational background characteristics interacted with national values, so that generally the above relationships between national values and training indicators were more pronounced in the presence of service sector, high technology, and large size (except for the relationship between collectivism and organizational needs, which was more pronounced in low-tech organizations). The implications of these results are particularly relevant to international organizations, which tend to emphasize global organizational culture and standard organizational practices. Design of training policy and practices should take into consideration contextual values and their interaction with organizational characteristics.",Cross culture; National values; Organizational training,Cross culture; International organizations; National values; Organizational characteristics; Organizational cultures; Organizational effectiveness; Organizational practices; Organizational trainings

Our understandings of the key functions performed by organizing visions - interpretation, legitimation and mobilization - however, are very limited, as are the specific actions engaged in by innovation entrepreneurs. The research presented in this paper begins to address this need by developing a conceptual framework through which to examine the legitimation function performed by an organizing vision and the discursive strategies IT entrepreneurs may engage in to promote the legitimization of an innovation. The framework builds upon a taxonomy of legitimacy and legitimation strategies by Suchman (1995). In addition, to adapt this taxonomy to the context of IT innovations we draw on the work by Ramiller and Swanson (2003) on critical receptions of executive response to organizing visions of IT. 20 discursive strategies for gaining and maintaining legitimacy of IT innovations are identified, categorized according to the type of legitimacy supported - pragmatic, moral or cognitive. A case study of an IT innovation in healthcare, computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems, is employed to illustrate how IT entrepreneurs utilize these strategies. 142 press releases issued by vendors of CPOE software, hardware and services from 1998 to 2005 were content-analyzed and examples of each strategy are presented. This work contributes to elaboration of the organizing vision concept and offers insight into the specific discursive strategies used by IT entrepreneurs.",IT innovation; Legitimacy; Organizing visions,Public relations; Computerized physician order entry systems; Conceptual frameworks; Institutional process; IT innovation; Legitimacy; Organizing visions; Press release; Taxonomies

Although unreasonable, this assumption is still considered useful by many economists even without empirical proof, i.e. it is a postulate. In this article we present unique findings of bonds of friendship among managers in rival companies and analyze the impact these relationships have on competition and price setting. The analysis builds on personal interviews of 190 store managers in the clothing business in 18 towns and urban areas throughout Norway. We report that managers meet often and exchange business information. Many possess information about aspects of their competitors that are not known publicly; for example, the mark-up factor they apply. Most managers have at least tenuous friendships with all local managers of competing stores competitors, while about one out of four managers know each other very well. The postulate in economics that actors are atomistic is therefore refuted. Furthermore, we find that friendship among managers in competing stores reduce the degree of price competition by between 9 and 15 percent. The empirical material also indicates that strong friendships have more of an effect on reducing the degree of price competition than do weak friendships, and that friendship does not lead to higher prices on local markets.",,Competition; Costs; Business information; Local markets; Mark-up; Price competition; Price setting; Rival companies; Social relationships; Urban areas; Managers

Our findings indicate that referent group norms significantly explain excessive absence behavior, even when taking into account the absence norms associated with the formal organizational units within which these referent groups are often nested. They also indicate that permissive referent group norms are likely to have a greater impact on the probability of target excessive absence when the target has a more conformist disposition, and that the association between reference group norms and the probability of excessive absenteeism is mediated by targets' perceptions of the net subjective expected utility of absenteeism.",,Organizational units; Reference group; Social identity; Social influence theory; Subjective expected utility

Drawing from an empirical study of the informal social networks among new ventures in the open source software industry, this paper examines how ventures' network strategies mediate the effects of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) on firm performance. Our findings indicate that ventures with a strong EO both occupied more central network positions in the industry and maintained more extensive bridging ties outside the industry. In addition we find that new ventures that were prominent in the industry and sustained extensive interindustry ties performed significantly better, while ventures that were centrally positioned in the communication network of the industry reported significantly lower levels of firm performance. After controlling for network effects, the direct effect of EO on firm performance failed to reach significance. Together these results show that ventures require effective network strategies in order to translate their EO into superior performance. More importantly, this paper shows that sustaining a strong EO may be harmful to firm performance since it may induce entrepreneurs to build social networks that have unintended consequences for their firms' competitive advantage.

The gamut of organizational change models runs from one end of the spectrum, which describes organizations as being ""inert"" from fear of change to the other end of the spectrum whereby organizations are described as following ""rapid, time-paced changes"" for fear of consequences if they don't change. When organizations do change, researchers have described the changes as involving some degree of discontinuous, behavioral shift. Such models as punctuated equilibrium, evolutional, discontinuous change, episodic change or rapid, time-paced evolution focus on organizations as dynamic entities exhibiting varying degrees of discontinuous change over differing time horizons. The theory of emergent organizational change develops a macro theory of organizational change that incorporates different models of organizational change found in the literature. By viewing organizational change at a macroscopic level, competing models of organizational change are seen as complimenting one another. Using a nonlinear dynamical systems perspective, organizational change is defined as a generative mechanism whereby organizational change schemas emerge from the organizing process.",,Dynamical systems; Competing models; Generative mechanism; Macroscopic levels; Organizational change; Punctuated equilibrium; Time horizons; Nonlinear dynamical systems

Although commonly maligned as a tool of technology promoters and as a companion to fads or crazes, exaggeration appears to play an important, if ambiguous, role in the communication and diffusion of major information technology (IT) innovations. This paper takes some initial steps toward developing a theory of exaggeration in the information systems domain. Exaggeration is situated in the larger context defined by the roles that discourse and rhetoric in interorganizational fields play in the social construction and dissemination of IT innovations. Exaggeration, then, is seen to enter at points defined by the knowledge requirements of organizations. Different species of exaggeration emerge within the larger innovation discourse in connection with organizations' need to ascertain the know what, know why, know where, know when, and know how of the innovation. This preliminary effort to develop taxonomy and to outline a functional theory of exaggeration is complemented by calls for further theorizing that would embrace process issues.",,Information use; Technology transfer; Application of information technologies; Functional theory; Information technology innovation; Inter-organizational; IT innovation; Knowledge requirements; Process issues; Social constructions; Information systems

After a brief discussion of the use of poetry to understand organizational life, we analyze various excerpts from Frost's well-known and lesser known works.

There are sound theoretical arguments that growth improves profitability (e.g. scale, market power and learning arguments), and in turn that profitability allows future growth (e.g. resource based arguments). Conversely, there are reasons why growth may hamper profitability (e.g. managerial challenges and inertia arguments). We provide insights concerning the growth-profitability dynamics of young firms in two ways. First, the paper integrates various theoretical arguments concerning profit-growth relationships to develop a model of firm development. Second, adopting a novel schema, we study the evolution of over 3,500 small firms across a two-dimensional growth-profitability performance space. Consistent with previous research, our results indicate young firms are most likely to be in the high growth performance groups. Interestingly, young firms are most likely to have either relatively high or low profitability, but less likely to have medium profitability. Focussing on profits first and then striving for growth is a more likely road to sustained strong performance than is using growth to improve profitability. In fact, young firms combining high growth with low profitability tend to have very weak future performance. This said, we find the performance of young firms is more weakly determined by their past performance than for older firms.",Development; Growth; Profit,Growth (materials); Development; Future performance; Growth and profitability; Market Power; Performance spaces; Resource-based; Theoretical arguments; Two-dimensional growth; Profitability

Three hundred and thirty-three employees of a large mid-western university, ranging in occupations from the trades through senior administration, responded to a 102 item instrument assessing aspects of spirit at work. Factor analyses revealed 4 distinct factors: engaging work, sense of community, spiritual connection, and mystical experience. Using the results of item analyses and factor analyses, 18 items were selected to constitute the new scale. Analyses reveal high internal consistency for both the total scale (á = .93) and the four subscales (á's from .86 to .91). There was no relationship between SAWS scores and age, gender, education, or income. However, SAWS scores were related to occupation and marital status. Management and professional staff reported significantly higher levels of spirit at work than did administrative, clerical, technical, or trades staff. Individuals who were separated, divorced, or widowed reported more spirit at work than those individuals who were single. Significant relationships between some demographic factors and some of the subscales were also found.

We begin by surveying the development of the social scientific literature on entrepreneurship since the field first emerged as an area of academic interest in the 1940s. We show that despite theoretical agreement on the importance of context in the study of entrepreneurship, empirical research in recent years has tended to display declining analytical attention to historical setting in favor of focusing on entrepreneurial behavior and cognition. We highlight why analysis of historical context as well as behavior is essential to the study of entrepreneurship. We then outline some of the specific ways in which historical methods can help scholars analyze historical context in studies of entrepreneurial behavior. To ground our discussion, we focus on how historical methods can contribute to the emerging field of international entrepreneurship. We conclude by arguing that these methods can stimulate the kind of exchanges between the history and theory of entrepreneurship that Schumpeter envisioned.",Entrepreneurship; Institutions; Path dependence,Societies and institutions; Empirical research; Entrepreneurial behavior; Entrepreneurship; Historical methods; International entrepreneurships; Path dependence; Scientific literature; Scientific studies; Behavioral research

This paper examines this issue conceptually and empirically, with an application to joint ventures. Uncertainty is widely held to be a principal motivation for using joint ventures to expand internationally, as well as to be a predictor of investments in real options. We distinguish between forms of uncertainty which resolve endogenously versus exogenously, and theorize that only exogenous uncertainty will have the impact predicted by real options theory. Using a sample of 6,472 Sino-foreign joint ventures established between 1979 and 1996, we show that investors' choices of equity shares are indeed consistent with real options predictions when uncertainty resolves exogenously, but not when uncertainty resolves endogenously. We discuss implications for real options research and joint venture research.",International market entry; Joint ventures; Real options,International trade; International joint ventures; International markets; Joint ventures; Real Options; Real options theory; Mergers and acquisitions

Heads of organizations need to decide whether to adopt this role as a part of their overall corporate strategy. Our aim is to provide evidence to aid such a decision, specifically on the potential importance of leader reputation to organization reputation. As there are relatively few CEO's who are well known to the public an analysis across the leading competitors in a commercial sector can be impractical. Our empirical work is therefore set in the market for votes and the strategy of political parties and their leaders. Our context is that of general elections in Britain where the public will be aware of the reputation of the larger parties and their leaders. Political party and leader reputations are measured to test the idea of interdependency in two surveys, 2001 n=876, 2005 n=406 allowing comparisons to be made over time. Organization and leader reputations are found to correlate highly but to be distinct. Changes in leader image over time have a contingent influence over party image. Existing 'customers' are less influenced than non-customers by a change in leader reputation. The implications for any organization, that the leader's reputation can be highly influential with the public in promoting corporate reputation are discussed including the idea this should be part of the CEO's remit.",Politics; Reputation,Commercial sector; Competitive advantage; Corporate reputations; Corporate strategies; General Elections; Political parties; Politics; Reputation; Competition

A framework is advanced which combines the insights of both theories to provide a clearer and more realistic account of the economic exchange relations within joint ventures. The TCE paradigm suggests that joint ventures, as a hybrid form of governing economic transactions, inhere a certain extent of uncertainty and threat of opportunism, and puts forth such processes as dominant control by one parent organization, commitment of and cooperation between the parent organizations to effectively manage this type of interorganizational cooperation. However, the TCE paradigm does not explain how the aforementioned processes may be developed. The conceptual lens of social capital is capable of providing such a needed explanation. It is proposed that social capital is a crucial antecedent of social controls, cooperation between, and commitment of a joint venture's parent organizations. Social capital further moderates the positive relationship between cultural distance and conflict between the parent organizations of international joint ventures, and so reduces the likelihood of the latter. Reduced conflict potential, the use of social controls, enhanced cooperation, and higher commitment, in turn, decrease the extent of uncertainty and threat of opportunism inherent in joint ventures.",Joint Ventures; Social Capital; Transaction Cost Economics,Costs; Mergers and acquisitions; Economic exchange; Economic transactions; International joint ventures; Interorganizational cooperation; Joint ventures; Parent organizations; Social capitals; Transaction cost economics; Process control

I specifically examine how changes in laws and developments in technology influenced coordination capabilities, organizational growth, and acquisitions in the US banking industry. I analyze bank growth in the twentieth century at two levels during two key historical eras. At the state level between 1896 and 1978 I show that in states in which branching was legally permitted and the technical environment was more advanced banks were larger and more geographically dispersed than were banks in states that did not exhibit these characteristics. I further show that banks founded under these conditions were more likely to pursue acquisitions following the deregulation of the banking industry in 1978. These findings suggest that banks founded in environments where coordination over distance was possible developed a capability that proved to be an enduring advantage and that the current structure of the banking industry reflects the variation in the historical environments in which banks were founded.",,Banking industry; Business environments; Current structure; Technical environments; Twentieth century

This may be an important finding, as many ""action"" and ""OD"" methods presently rely on group-level interventions as a means of uncovering individual-level rationality.

The rise of institutional ownership was widely expected to promote corporate governance reforms that serve the interests of shareholders. Yet, empirical research has generally shown that the level of institutional ownership has mixed, and often weak or insignificant effects on several organizational outcomes, including the adoption of board reforms, executive compensation, corporate diversification strategy, and firm performance. We offer a theoretical explanation for why institutional investors may not leverage their ownership power to force changes in governance and strategy. Specifically, we contend that high levels of institutional ownership may prompt top managers to engage in interpersonal influence behavior in the form of ingratiation and persuasion directed at institutional fund managers, deterring the latter from using their ownership power to coerce changes that could benefit shareholders. We suggest that extant theories of corporate governance have overestimated the organizational consequences of increased institutional ownership because they focus only on coercive power as a source of influence, without recognizing the potential for interpersonal influence processes to provide an alternative source of power in manager-shareholder relationships. We test our theory with a dataset that combines original survey data on CEO interpersonal influence behavior from a large sample of executives and institutional fund managers, together with archival data on institutional ownership, changes in board structure, CEO compensation and diversification strategy.

From four high tech firms, we collected network data from 417 employees. Regression analyses showed that employees enmeshed in highly embedded social networks where they are tied to colleagues who are tied to each other are more prone to stay. Moreover, we found that network closure effects are stronger in high-commitment firms, where constrained networks more effectively retain incumbents.

Christian theology from a Neo-Calvinist perspective can lead to the development of a more nuanced approach to addressing work beyond simply a generally positive orientation. Particularly, the Christian themes of Creation, Fall and Redemption are used as a framework to analyze current management theories and to prescribe further perspectives on the nature and meaning associated with work. The themes of Creation and Fall are consistent with two underlying paradigms of work ideology found in common theories in OB, MSR and HR Management literature: One paradigm reflects a more positive, hopeful view of human nature and work, and can be found in concepts ranging from empowerment, trust, justice, vocation, OCBs, servant leadership and forgiveness. The second paradigm focuses on the ""dark side"" of organizational life and includes concepts such as job stress, role conflict, absenteeism, grievances, unethical or illegal behaviors and shirking. We suggest the need for the development of a third paradigm, drawn from the Christian theme of Redemption, which recognizes the tension between work as it was intended at Creation, and work that has been marred by the Fall - i.e., ""toil.""

Boundary-spanning behaviour relates to the behaviour of customer-contact employees of service firms that derives from their unique position as boundary spanners and is tailored to the unique context of service organizations.

Location within the field and the institutional construction of manager's cognition,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085399910&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2006.22898656&partnerID=40&md5=7a12d6074ad0b305b79e9369a2fe8978,"We demonstrate that differential location in an institutional field leads to a differential impact of institutional pressures on the cognition of actors. We measure the adoption of a set of management techniques called ""Manufacturing Best Practices"". Our indicators of differential location in the field are whether respondents are public or private, large or small, subsidiaries or independent firms, and technologically sophisticated or unsophisticated. We argue that the first of each pair is more embedded in institutional discourse, as a consequence of differential location in the field, and therefore more likely to acquire institutionalized cognitions. Our indicator of cognition is the extent to which the configuration of practices adopted corresponds to the normatively preferred configuration. We find that firms which are more tightly linked to the field are more likely adopt the practices which are central to the category (in the sense of Rosch or Barsalou's work on category structure) and less likely to adopt the practices which are peripheral.",,Best practices; Institutional pressures; Management techniques; Location
Global sensing and sensibility - A multi-stage matching assessment of competitive advantage from foreign sources for innovation,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085782868&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2006.27163055&partnerID=40&md5=18079c02d796b65e7afc267e042ef0be,"We focus on a core competitive capability of a modern firm: The ability to deliver successful innovations in a globalized environment. Companies literally find themselves confronted with a world of ideas. The challenge remains to decide which impulses should be on top of the list and which at the bottom. Given limited resources and substantial investments, betting on the wrong horse can be risky and costly. Theoretically integrated in capability based view of the firm we investigate firms' capabilities to assimilate, identify and prioritize valuable knowledge across national, cultural and social borders; a competence which we call global sensing. We establish an analytical framework to examine whether global sensing activities generate competitive advantage. Consequently, we develop an empirical, multistage evaluation strategy. The latter rests on a matching approach for a recent, broad sample of almost 1,700 German companies from both services and manufacturing. We find the strongest and most consistent support for global sensing as a strategic enabler for technological leadership. Apart from this strategic advantage we observe that foreign external sources for innovation are generally not superior to domestic ones.",,Competitive advantage; Competitive capabilities; Evaluation strategies; External sources; German companies; Global sensing; Strategic advantages; Substantial investments; Competition
A comparison of acquirer and target perspectives on acquisition success,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087222962&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2006.27182216&partnerID=40&md5=61a456486e0eed60af5db0bc543a9c24,"Focusing on technology intensive firms, I compare acquirer and target firm appraisals of acquisition success to value captured by key target firm stakeholders, namely employees, customers, investors, and the target firm's strategic initiative. Findings suggest that an acquirer will regard an acquisition as successful when the target's post-acquisition ability to innovate has been served, but that a target firm, and more specifically a selling entrepreneur, will regard an acquisition as successful when their private entrepreneurial aspirations have been served.",,Strategic initiative; Technology intensive firms; Mergers and acquisitions
Corporate environmental strategy: Extending the natural resource-based view of the firm,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032487143&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2006.27176644&partnerID=40&md5=845915ee149ecc444866f1d0d3b52034,"In this paper, we integrate the results of various empirical studies which build upon Hart's (1995) seminal paper, published in the Academy of Management Review a decade ago. We identify two primary streams of research within the natural resource-based view of the firm which investigate alternatively the antecedents and the consequences of corporate environmental strategy. We extend Hart's natural resource-based view in two main ways. First, in terms of consequences, we explicitly consider how environmental investments in particular resource domains (as manifestations of corporate environmental strategy), can support the development of firm-specific capabilities, thus showing specifically how corporate strategy can lead to competitive advantage. Second, in terms of antecedents, we place the natural resource-based view approach in a broader organizational context, which takes into account parameters such as ecocentric leadership and related values as the drivers of environmental investments. While rooted within the natural resource-based view, our integrative framework is able to accommodate findings from empirical environmental studies grounded in other traditions. We use our integrative framework to advance recent debates within the resource-based view and corporate environmental strategy literatures. It is investments in specific resource domains, not environmental strategy per se, ultimately determine environmental performance.",,Competition; Investments; Natural resources; Competitive advantage; Environmental investments; Environmental performance; Environmental strategy; Environmental studies; Integrative framework; Organizational context; Resource-based view of the firm; Environmental management
Towards a contingency theory of knowledge exchange in organizations,2006,"Academy of Management 2006 Annual Meeting: Knowledge, Action and the Public Concern, AOM 2006",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872033006&doi=10.5465%2fambpp.2006.22898650&partnerID=40&md5=aebd28086860663ecf12521c28b466e6,"Building on qualitative data, we model how individual agents, rather than organizational units or firms, search and exchange knowledge. We use the fine-grained model to suggest moving away from the ""more is better"" approach to knowledge exchange towards a more contingent approach. Employing an agentbased modeling approach, we present three synthetic experiments and derive testable propositions. First, we propose that the higher the individual learning rate, the lower the returns on organizational knowledge exchange and thus the lower the differences between exchange and non-exchange organizations, and between different exchange configurations. Second, we propose that the lower the problem complexity, the lower the returns on organizational knowledge exchange, with similar organizational consequences. Third, we propose that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the size of individual memory and the returns from knowledge exchange. We conclude by calling for a greater consideration of direct and opportunity cost in organizational knowledge exchange.",Performance; Reciprocity; Social Network,Social networking (online); Individual learning; Knowledge exchange; Organizational knowledge; Organizational units; Performance; Problem complexity; Reciprocity; Synthetic experiments; Knowledge management

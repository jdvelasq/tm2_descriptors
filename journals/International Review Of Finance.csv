We find that firms experiencing high net labor outflows have lower future risk-adjusted returns. This return predictability is found to originate mainly from gross labor outflows. We further show that the workers' labor market decisions better reflect information on the firms' fundamentals when firm sales are greater related to wages or when workers can more easily transfer to better jobs. Finally, we confirm the workers' ability to predict firm performance. © 2022 International Review of Finance Ltd.","labor flows; labor market; rank-and-file employees; stock returns",""

Moreover, from preferences for liquidity perspective, our model can potentially reconcile the conflicting predictions on the interaction between disasters and growth in the empirical findings. Finally, we find that preferences for liquidity cause policymakers to become more incentivized in mitigating disaster risk and lead them overestimate the welfare benefit of policy instruments. © 2023 International Review of Finance Ltd.","economic growth; preferences for liquidity; rare disaster; risk management",""

The negative relationship between CSVs and investment inefficiency is less pronounced for firms with higher quality financial reporting and better corporate governance. In addition, CSVs show a decrease in corporate overinvestment by monitoring the risk-taking activities of younger CEOs and expansionary firms, and supervising the use of excess free cash flows. Meanwhile, CSVs could mitigate underinvestment by reducing managerial shirking from entrenched CEOs, such as dual or longer-tenured CEOs.

Moreover, oil contributes most heavily toward the common trends, implying that oil is the “leader” sector that drives each asset class toward long-run equilibrium relationships. Short-run analyses indicate that oil shocks induce a negative response in stock and housing returns and a positive reaction in bond returns, showing a tendency to become more intense and persistent after the GFC.

Our analysis of the dynamics of return spillovers in static and time-varying settings identifies that the stock markets of Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea act as constant and largest net transmitters of shocks throughout the period from January 2003 to July 2021. The Chinese stock market is found to have the lowest return connectedness with other regional markets, which could be due to the local foreign ownership regulations. Visualization of the net pairwise return spillover network shows that Singapore is the sole net transmitter of shocks to all other markets in the ASEAN5 + 5 group, whereas, China, despite its market size is the sole net recipient. Two other markets in the regional group are identified as the net receivers, Japan and the Philippines, with the former becoming a net recipient from 2007.

We also identify heterogeneities in ownership structure and find that high director ownership encourages R&D in firms with greater growth opportunities despite higher EPU. Moreover, Japanese directors suffer from the “quiet life problem,” which further reduces their incentive to change R&D investment during periods of EPU. © 2024 International Review of Finance Ltd.","economic policy uncertainty; ownership structure; R&D",""

We find that the imposition of MaPs helps counter REER appreciation only when it results from higher gross portfolio debt inflows. In other words, the moderating impact of MaPs on REER varies by the type of capital flows. We also show that these results hold only for countries with high degrees of financial development, possibly because MaPs work primarily via the financial system and hence there needs to be a reasonable level of financial development for them to be effective. © 2021 International Review of Finance Ltd.","capital flows; financial development; macroprudential policies; real exchange rates",""

Such underperformance is only observed in non-crisis periods but not in economic crisis periods (i.e., the 2020 pandemic recession and 2008 financial turmoil). We attribute the observed underperformance of SR ETFs during the non-crisis periods to their limited diversification of unsystematic risks resulting from various negative or positive screens employed in the funds. We also find that net fund flows of the SR ETFs are less sensitive to past negative performance than are conventional fund flows.

We show, in a model-free setting, that barbell allocations form a convex set in the mean–variance space, and the endpoints of the efficient frontier can switch as time passes, reversing the set of efficient allocations. Consequently, duration-based immunization, which is not minimum variance, can exhibit temporary inefficiency. This result is numerically illustrated in a one-factor Gaussian and a two-factor non-Gaussian model.

As the new dividend tax policy waives the tax on cash dividends for investors holding a stock for more than a year, it encourages long-term investment behavior. From 2013 to 2017, we find that stock turnover, return volatility, and turnover volatility decrease after the policy enforcement, especially for stocks with high dividend yields. This result shows that dividend tax reforms increase investors' stock investment horizons and help stabilize the market. However, our findings demonstrate that stock crash risk increases after policy enforcement. Further analysis shows that earnings management through real activities manipulation for stocks with a higher dividend yield contributes to an increase in stock crash risk. Therefore, one externality of the dividend tax cut policy tied to the investment horizon is that top managers of firms with a higher dividend yield may take advantage of investors' passive longer-term investment behavior and engage in more earnings management.

This suggests that institutions prefer IPOs that are associated with ownership structure change, and are indifferent to whether the motivation behind the IPO is fund raising or original owners' value liquidation. Moreover, initial institutional holdings are unrelated to commonly used measures of pre-IPO operating performance such as return on sales and return on assets.

Using a large sample of US data, we find that firms having a prospector-type business strategy are associated with inefficient labor investment, while those having a defender-type business strategy are associated with efficient labor investment. We provide evidence that uncertainty, rather than the agency problem, causes prospector-type firms to exhibit inefficient labor investment.

We applied the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model of Shin et al. (Festschrift in honor of Peter Schmidt, 2014, Springer, 281–314) to determine the long run and the short run asymmetries. The presence of a cointegrating relationship confirms that despite short-run departures, the relationship remains stable in the long run. The nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model estimates that when aggregate revenue increases by $1,000, the S&P index is expected to increase by 8.64 points, but when the aggregate revenue decreases by the same amount, the market decreases by 31.4 points. Similarly, when the aggregate income increases by $1,000, the S&P index is likely to increase by 22.59 points, whereas if the aggregate income decreases by the same amount, the index would decrease more steeply by 32.11 points. Based on these findings, the present study establishes an asymmetric relationship between two important accounting variables. The study also confirms the validation of prospect theory in the S&P index valuation of its constituent stocks' financial performance. Aside from using the model on aggregate data for the S&P index, we also analyzed 28 individual US stocks to validate the findings. © 2021 International Review of Finance Ltd.","aggregate earnings; aggregate revenue; asymmetric impact; nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model; prospect theory; US S&P 500 stock index",""

An innovation financing tool called equity-for-guarantee swap is introduced to solve the dilemma of financing constraints. The productivity of the firm is a random variable following a two-point distribution and its value can be observed in advance by the entrepreneur but not by the insurer. Our main goal is to fix the fair guarantee cost with asymmetry information and examine how the cost differs from the one under the same situation except with symmetric information. We solve a Nash equilibrium of the game between the entrepreneur and the insurer and specify the condition to determine whether a separating equilibrium or pooling one will be achieved. We find that at the separating equilibrium, the high-profit firm will sacrifice a profit to send a signal for the purpose of separating itself from the low-profit one by increasing the latter's mimicking cost. The pooling equilibrium occurs when the insurer can not distinguish the firm's type and therefore, the insurer demands the same guarantee cost for all firms. © 2019 International Review of Finance Ltd. 2019","",""

We use an IV strategy to account for potential endogeneity of the number of banks in a region.

In particular, the investment threshold has a nonmonotonic (U-shaped) relation with the arrival rate of the growth opportunity, in that it starts to decrease and then increase with the arrival rate. The outcome is driven by the tradeoff between benefit and cost of the prospective expansion, and the magnitude of that rests on the level of arrival rate. For optimally levered firm, the financial leverage ratio displays a U-shaped relation with the arrival rate.

In particular, we test the hypothesis that religiosity can influence the normality of the return distribution. Our tests are motivated by the idea that religion is an integral part of the culture within a society that influences managerial decision-making. Local religiosity (or lack thereof) can shape the values, beliefs and decisions of managers including those related to the types of investments that are attractive. We hypothesize that in more religious cultures, individuals will be more loss averse since religion may be used as an attempt to avoid very unfavorable outcomes (Hell). Managers in these religious cultures, therefore, may be attracted to capital investment projects that avoid tail risk, which may help explain the positive skewness of the return distribution of stocks.

In doing so, the role of media independence in shaping this impact is also examined. The empirical results suggest that stock illiquidity is significantly and positively associated with firm-level crash risk. Furthermore, the positive association between illiquidity and crash risk has been mitigated in countries with independent media, characterized by a lower level of state ownership and a higher level of press freedom, in addition to the reduction effect of media independence per se on crash risk.

This paper also proposes a new method for estimating the parameters in a Lévy Jump-diffusion process. The real data from the Taiwanese bond market are used to illustrate how their model can be applied in practical situations. The authors compare the pricing results for the influential variables with no jump effects, with jump magnitudes following the normal distribution, and with jump magnitudes following the gamma distribution.

Furthermore, model uncertainty leads to insufficient investment, which provides an alternative explanation for under-investment.

In the second category, we included the density functional based on confluent hypergeometric function model, the mixture of lognormal distributions model, and the smoothed implied volatility smile. The density functional based on confluent hypergeometric function and the CGMY Gamma-OU produced 1-month term densities (RND and subjective probability density function) with the highest forecasting power of the 1-month USD/BRL exchange rate. Finally, we applied the CGMY Gamma-OU model to extract a sample of subjective cumulative probabilities of 1-month USD/BRL movements, and used them as explanatory variables in predictive time series models, whose dependent variable was the 1-month carry trade return.

Utilizing quantile regression analysis, we examine the determinants of financial contagion at different levels of time-varying correlations.

A greater degree of comparability lowers information acquisition costs, reduces the uncertainties associated with performance evaluation, and increases the overall quantity and quality of information available to corporate outsiders, which, in turn, helps investors to understand and evaluate the cash flow and performance of firms more accurately. Therefore, we hypothesize a negative association between financial statement comparability and IRV. Using a large US sample from 1981 to 2013, we show that financial statement comparability is associated with lower level of IRV significantly. We also find this association to be more pronounced in a poor information environment.

We find that bank loans are more closely related to profitability for firms with bank connections, while firms’ political connections weaken this relationship. We further find that the influence of bank connections is more significant for firms from less supported industries or less developed regions. Furthermore, firms with bank connections are less likely to become financially distressed after the initiation of their bank loans and experience higher future stock returns, while firms with political connections experience the opposite outcome.

After documenting significant spread returns to 16 anomalies (including several not previously studied in Australia), the empirical analysis provides cautious support that the recently-proposed investment and profitability factors have a role to play. The number of anomalies that remains after risk adjustment decreases under the five-factor model. Further, while the magnitude of reduction in alpha is modest, our testing shows that it is statistically significant in many cases. However, both three-factor and five-factor models repeatedly fail the Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken's (1989) (GRS) test, suggesting that the quest for a better asset pricing model is not yet complete. © 2017 International Review of Finance Ltd. 2017","",""

Consistent with this notion, we find that independent directors significantly improved firm value during the Great Recession of 2008.

In the long run, when the firm loses its potential to improve efficiency, growth is driven only by the progress in productivity. As a result of this growth mechanism, consistent with the data, the growth rate and its volatility, as well as Tobin's Q, decrease with age and size.

We find evidence of relatively strong dependence among tail losses of different operational loss types within banks. Applying a copula framework, we estimate that the median correlation parameter for the key operational loss types is around 30% and exceeds 50% for some banks in our sample. Our results contrast with the previous literature that documents that correlation parameter estimates are in the range of 5–10% and typically do not exceed 20%. Further, we demonstrate significant model risk from not accounting for dependence among tail losses, resulting in material underestimation of operational risk. In addition, we investigate dependence of operational losses across banks. Using a copula framework, we estimate correlation parameters between losses of large banks in our sample to be 42% on average. This result suggests the presence of systemic risk from the simultaneous occurrence of operational tail losses in different large banks. © 2017 International Review of Finance Ltd. 2017","",""

We consider endogenous and exogenous conversion thresholds, respectively. Under the exogenous case, there is an explicit optimal fraction of equity allocated to CoCo holders upon conversion, such that the agency cost reaches zero. Numerical analysis demonstrates that under an endogenous conversion threshold, CoCo induces overinvestment, a higher leverage, a possible bigger agency cost, and a stronger incentive to increase risk. But if the conversion threshold is exogenously determined, almost the opposite holds true. © 2016 International Review of Finance Ltd.","",""

Buying pressure before the ex-dividend day aimed at capturing the dividend and tax credit leads to an increase in prices that subsequently reverse in the ex-dividend period. This effect is concentrated in those stocks distributing a tax credit with their dividend payments. The price pressure resulting from order imbalance is substantially higher around the ex-dividend day relative to the effect observed outside this period.

The data suggest a trend of increased emphasis on higher credit scores accompanying a trend of increased riskiness in other origination attributes. Over time, this increased emphasis on credit scoring coincided with deterioration in FICO performance largely because of the fact that higher credit score originations of later cohorts were more likely to have riskier attributes.

The abnormal returns are largely insensitive to the four Carhart factors and produce economically and statistically significant alphas of between 10 and 15% per year after transaction costs. This performance is robust to different lags of the MA and in subperiods while investor sentiment, liquidity risks, business cycles, up and down markets, and the default spread cannot fully account for its performance. The MA strategy works just as well with randomly generated returns and bootstrapped returns. The substantial market timing ability of the MA strategy appears to be the main driver of the abnormal returns. The returns to the MA strategy resemble the returns of an imperfect at-the-money protective put strategy relative to the underlying portfolio. The lagged signal to switch has substantial predictive power over the subsequent return of the REIT index. The MA strategy avoids the sharp downturn at the beginning of 2008 and substantially outperforms the cumulative returns of the buy-and-hold strategy using all of the 20 REIT indexes.

For firms that adopt a consistent hedging policy, idiosyncratic volatility, whether contemporaneous or lagged, is insignificant in Fama–MacBeth regressions, controlling for size, book-to-market, momentum, liquidity, and industry effects. © 2017 International Review of Finance Ltd. 2017","",""

The model not only avoids the possibility of the termination hazard rate taking an irrational (i.e., negative) value, but it also makes it easier to derive a valuation formula for a risky asset. Our model can also effortless apply because the parameters of the gamma distribution can easily be estimated from market data. An example using Taiwanese bond data illustrates how the model can be utilized for practical applications. To facilitate understanding of how accurately the different models price risky bonds, we compare their out-of-sample pricing errors for different hazard rate specifications assuming normal and gamma distributions.

The paper also examines the association between ownership by the largest shareholder and dividend payments.

We find that in terms of foreign bank lending, the cost of debt financing is significantly higher for firms whose largest shareholder is a foreign institutional one. The results support the hypothesis that because of potential agency conflicts between shareholders and creditors, having block institutional shareholders tend to increase the borrowers' debt burden. There is further evidence supporting this agency conflict hypothesis as we find that the effects of large institutional shareholders on borrowing costs become larger (smaller) when the conflicts are aggravated (mitigated). © 2014 International Review of Finance Ltd. 2014.","",""

We use a sample of public firms from 2002 to 2007 that chose to either disclose or not disclose quarterly financial reports.

The study also examines changes in bank systemic risk during these event periods. The Australian market offers a unique opportunity to observe the impact of the introduction of the DWFG in that it lacked any explicit deposit insurance prior to the crisis. Initially, the crisis period had little impact on bank systematic risk while bank systemic risk increased considerably. The share market downturn caused a marked increase in both systematic and systemic risks for Australia's major internationally connected banks followed by a reduction in both systematic and systemic risks with the introduction of the guarantee scheme for all Australian banks. © 2014 International Review of Finance Ltd.","",""

In particular, board independence reduces total risk and idiosyncratic risk by 24.87% and 12.60%, respectively. The evidence is consistent with the notion that board independence represents an effective governance mechanism that prevents managers from taking excessive risk.

Actually, liquidity risk is increasing the total price risk by over 25%, even at 10-day horizons and for liquid blue chip stocks and especially in larger, yet realistic order sizes beyond €1 million. When correcting for liquidity risk, it is commonly assumed that liquidity risk can be simply added to price risk.

According to our ownership view, capital structure is partly determined by the incentives and the goals of those who are in control of the firm. Our results strongly support this view. As a consequence of managerial entrenchment and rent expropriation phenomena, self-interested agents (entrenched managers and controlling owners) chose the capital structure most appropriate for their own best interest. Additionally, we find evidence of an interaction effect between managerial ownership and ownership concentration, in particular, the larger debt increments promoted by outside owners when managers are entrenched. © 2010 The Authors.

A simple modeling framework is provided where financial supervision is an international public good and thus may be underprovided globally. The article asks a simple question: would national supervisors cooperate and increase the level of global supervision, and by how much? I use coalition formation game theory to address this question. The main results are the following. If the situation is completely symmetric (identical-sized countries and symmetric externalities), the amount of cooperation is relatively high and full cooperation could be achieved for particular numbers of countries involved in the negotiations. However, in general, full cooperation would not be an equilibrium because countries have incentives to free ride on the cooperation of other countries. Introducing asymmetries in the size of the countries and/or in the externalities between countries reduces the scope for cooperation. However, higher asymmetries are not necessarily related to lower cooperation if the distribution of asymmetries has a particular shape, such that big countries are generating large externalities on small countries, as it might be the case in reality. © International Review of Finance Ltd. 2011.","",""

We find that a three-tiered bailout policy that includes an ex post monitoring and bailout scheme for financial institutions with large systemic impacts ('too big to fail') is optimal. The optimal policy also requires a randomized bailout for medium-impact institutions ('Constructive Ambiguity'), and no bailout for institutions that have only minimal systemic consequences ('too small to save'). However, in a volatile, innovative market environment where individual institutions may know more than the government regulator, monitoring error could contribute to risk taking, leaving the government regulator to always play a 'catch-up' role in revising policy. Moreover, the optimal bailout policy may not be time-consistent: institutions not deemed 'too big to fail' may still have an incentive to take excessive risks and expect to be bailed out in case of insolvency, primarily due to the short-term orientation of the government. Finally, because an institution's systemic cost affects the probability of a bailout, we show that the boundary of an institution may be extended by the government subsidy. © 2013 International Review of Finance Ltd.","",""

We then identify distressed firms and analyze the effect of year t+1 operating and financing cash flows on 5-year failure rates for these firms using a new methodology, failure risk surprise. Results explain why LEV and BM are weak forecasters of 5-year failure rates: Low-LEV and low-BM (high-LEV and high-BM) distressed firms are less (more) likely to have a profit in year t+1, and are also more likely to issue equity (retire debt) in year t+1, interactions which tend to moderate failure risk. We also find that failure risk sensitivity to year t+1 operating result increases with both LEV and BM, while failure risk sensitivity to future macroeconomic conditions is significant only for high-LEV firms.

Three Markov switching models are examined, the Gaussian AR(1), Poisson AR(1), and State-Space autoregressive moving average (ARMA) (1,1), to find which gives the best fit. The State-Space Markov switching ARMA(1,1) model is found to be the best for describing Australian takeover activity as estimation results based on it have a lower Bayesian information criterion score than the other two models. Each model's ability to predict a 'wave' is then tested by including its estimated probability in a macroeconomic model to explain merger activity. The State-Space model also performs better because the inclusion of its estimated probability substantially increases the explanatory power of the regression model (measured by the regression adjusted R2). In addition, it predicted a takeover wave in 2009, which was closer to the actual incidents of takeover activity in the market at that time than the predictions of the other two models. The results are robust when the measure of takeover activity is changed from the number of takeover bids to the proportion of takeover bids relatively to the number of exchange-listed companies. © 2013 International Review of Finance Ltd. 2013.","",""

The other results are as follows: (i) existing debt has a negative effect, while the debt component of expansion financing has a positive effect, on investment; (ii) the debt component of the optimal expansion financing package is a decreasing function of the pre-expansion leverage ratio (consistent with mean reverting leverage ratios), and is also decreasing in the magnitude of the expansion opportunity; and (iii) the optimal pre-expansion leverage ratio is a decreasing function of both the firm's profitability and the magnitude of the growth opportunity.

In contrast, neither the spread nor the depth exhibit similar midday extreme values. Essentially, we identify a 90-min window in the afternoon when net valuable information arrives to the market in high frequency while liquidity is stable, and that may be an opportunity for some investors to time their trades. In addition, we show that market makers employ dynamic strategies that change the spread, the depth, or both to manage information asymmetry.

Using a Poisson regression model, we find that divestitures improve survival likelihood by reducing the probability and speed of market exit via takeover or bankruptcy, whereas layoffs increase the probability and speed of market exit via bankruptcy. Surprisingly, classifying firms into financially distressed and healthy groups, we find that distressed firms are less likely to restructure. Furthermore, while divestitures improve survival likelihood in both groups, layoff firms are less likely to survive, irrespective of whether they are distressed or healthy. Our findings are consistent with event studies that examine the market reaction to layoffs and divestiture decisions, and so provide some support for the view that the market correctly values the consequences of these restructuring actions on firm survival.

Rather than analyzing the predictions of the theory, we test its core assumption that information asymmetry is an important determinant of capital structure decisions. Our empirical results support the dynamic pecking order theory and its two testable implications. First, the probability of issuing equity increases with less pronounced firm-level information asymmetry. Second, firms exploit windows of opportunity by making relatively larger equity issuances and build up cash reserves (slack) after declines in firm-level information asymmetry. Firms from common law countries use parts of their proceeds from an equity issuance to redeem debt and to rebalance their capital structure.

However, bidders who announced their takeover bids during wave periods exhibit significant underperformance. For mergers that took place within waves, there is no difference in bid premiums nor is there a difference in the long-run returns of bidders involved during the first half and second half of the waves.

This finding is fairly consistent with the argument that the greater the macroeconomic risk the greater is the use of derivative instruments to hedge or speculate. The relationship between the macroeconomic risks and IRS volatility varies slightly across the different swap maturities but is robust to alternative volatility specifications.

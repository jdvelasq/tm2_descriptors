Relative corporate social performance and cost of equity capital: International evidence,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152083366&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2808&partnerID=40&md5=3675628ee14188c25e221235e17fa0fc,"This research examines the relationship between firms' corporate social performance (CSP) and the implied cost of equity capital using a sample of 25,938 firm-year observation from 49 countries during the period from 2002 to 2021. Using estimates of the firms' ex ante cost of equity capital, we examine its relationship with industry-relative measures of the firms' CSP, its environmental and social pillars and sub-pillars. We find that increased overall CSP reduces a firm's cost of equity capital up until a point, beyond which the marginal benefits of further CSP investment decrease. We find that the social pillar is the main driver of the reductions in cost of capital, in particular, a firm's performance in relation to its workforce, and that higher performance is increasingly rewarded with a lower cost of capital. Finally, we find that this relationship differs depending on the institutional context, with greater reductions in the cost of capital evident in countries with stronger institutional environments. © 2023 The Authors.

Labour reallocation and unemployment fluctuations: A tale of two tails,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161339696&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2845&partnerID=40&md5=a7121b81be939fd530e0e9191ffa50ea,This paper examines the sectoral shifts hypothesis for the US regional labour market using a quantile panel framework. We use a monthly panel dataset that spans over 1990–2016 for the 48 US states and employ a dynamic quantile panel data regression approach to investigate the asymmetric nature of the relationship between sectoral labour reallocation and unemployment fluctuations. The empirical evidence suggests that the impact of the employment dispersion index is relatively small and insignificant for lower levels of unemployment but becomes positive and highly significant for higher rates. Our findings bear out the asymmetry of reallocation disturbances for the US labour market. © 2023 The Authors.

"Arab Spring, democratization of corruption, and income inequality",2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163048205&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2853&partnerID=40&md5=dfd9de52b15a2a79b5b6896c0e817fd7,"How do political crises affect the interaction between economic and political outcomes? In this paper, we study one of the consequences of political turmoil by empirically examining whether the Arab Spring influenced the relationship between corruption and income inequality. Using panel data from 1996 to 2019 for the Middle East and North African (MENA) countries, we find that while corruption is positively associated with income inequality, the interaction term between corruption and the Arab Spring is negatively associated with income inequality. This result is consistent with the view that corruption has become more democratized after the Arab Spring. We use instrumental variable (IV) analysis to address potential endogeneity issues. Our findings suggest that not only studying the direct effects of political crises on economic and institutional variables is important, but studying their effects on shaping the association between economic and institutional variables can be insightful. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Arab Spring; corruption; democratization of corruption; income inequality; MENA; political crises,Middle East; North Africa; corruption; democratization; income distribution; institutional framework; panel data; political economy; political instability; social movement
ESG disclosure and financial performance of multinational enterprises: The moderating effect of board standing committees,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161819369&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2846&partnerID=40&md5=ad80d48ab3b303e28df8e067cb19a628,"The study examines the impact of board committee indexes on the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure, and accounting- and market-based performance measures of multinational enterprises (MNEs). Using quantile regression analysis and a large balanced panel data of 500 multinational companies operating in 40 countries from 2009 to 2019 (i.e., 5500 firm-year observations), we uncovered the following significant associations: (i) a positive relationship between ESG disclosure and accounting performance indicators for large-sized MNEs, but this relationship is counteracted by the negative influence of the audit and sustainability committee indexes; (ii) the association between market-based performance outcomes and ESG disclosure is positively affected by the compensation, nomination, and sustainability committee indexes, while it is negatively influenced by the audit committee index; (iii) the combined board committee index has varying impacts on the connection between the components of ESG disclosure, and accounting and market-relevant performance metrics for different sizes of MNEs; and (iv) while the audit and sustainability committee indexes exert negative effects on the relationship between the components of ESG disclosure and performance measures, these effects are countered by the positive moderating impacts of the compensation and nomination committee indexes.

"Impact of globalisation, remittances and human capital on environmental quality: Evidence from landlocked African countries",2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161422734&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2844&partnerID=40&md5=c196ef26b637f5d8cbe9d543db142e59,"Studying environmental quality is essential for promoting sustainable development and ensuring a healthy and prosperous future for all, as it directly affects human health, well-being, and quality of life. This paper looks at how globalisation, remittances, human capital, foreign direct investment, and financial growth affect carbon dioxide emissions in landlocked African countries from 1980 to 2018. The study looks at the elasticities between study factors by using second-generation tests, as well as Continuously-updated and Fully Modified (Cup-FM) and Continuously-updated and Bias-Corrected (Cup-BC) tests. The results show that remittances, human capital, natural resources, and income growth all make the environment worse by increasing CO2 emissions, whilst globalisation, foreign direct investment, and financial development all make it better by reducing emissions. The panel causality analysis shows that there are two ways in which transfers and CO2 emissions cause each other, but only one way in which CO2 emissions cause globalisation. Globalisation should be implemented sustainably to avoid irreversible long-term environmental impacts that deprive future generations of the chance to prosper or maintain their quality of life. It should also empower people and reduce inequality in landlocked countries. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",environmental quality; globalisation; human capital; landlocked African countries; remittances; sustained growth,Africa; environmental quality; foreign direct investment; future prospect; globalization; human capital; panel data; quality of life; remittance; sustainable development
The role of long- and short-run correlation networks in international portfolio selection,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85157987313&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2820&partnerID=40&md5=afd7ab158a4817c129a4b4a3e03f5174,"By considering the effect of long- and short-run correlation (LS) networks, we propose an LS network-augmented parametric portfolio selection model (LSNA-PP). First, we combine the dynamic conditional correlation-mixed data sampling (DCC-MIDAS) model with the planar maximally filtered graph (PMFG) method to construct LS networks and extract network topological characteristics. Second, we design portfolio weights as a function of these topological characteristics to construct the LSNA-PP model. Third, we apply the model to construct an international portfolio from 2010 to 2021. The empirical results illustrate the efficacy of the LSNA-PP model in two ways. First, the LSNA-PP model clarifies the economic interpretation of topological characteristics in portfolio selection, such as the positive effect of the long-run correlation network and the negative effect of the short-run correlation network on the weights. Second, the LSNA-PP model performs well in terms of return expectations, risk diversification, and attractive risk-adjusted returns, which are especially useful for stakeholders such as regulators, managers, and investors. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",DCC-MIDAS; financial network; mixed frequency; network topological characteristics; parametric strategy; portfolio selection,correlation; data interpretation; econometrics; economic analysis; efficiency measurement; financial market; financial system; investment; model test; parameterization; performance assessment; risk assessment; stakeholder; topology
An empirical investigation of the relationship between real exchange rate and innovation: Evidence from China,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152791085&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2814&partnerID=40&md5=1d99d4a64ffb3c05f92c3347ad704f61,"The aims of this study is to investigate the relationship between real exchange rate and innovation in China for the period spanning from 1985 to 2020 using an annual time series data collected from different sources. The study employs autoregressive distributed lag bound test and other econometrics techniques to analyse the short-run and long-run relationship among the variables. The findings of the study reveal the existence of short-run and long-run relationship between real exchange rate (undervalued RMB) and technological innovation. Furthermore, real exchange rate (undervalued RMB) has positive effect on innovation while real exchange rate volatility is negatively affect innovation. Based on the above empirical findings, the study suggests some policy implications which are considered important for fostering rapid and sustainable economic growth. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",cointegration; economic growth; innovation; real exchange rate; undervaluation,China; cointegration analysis; econometrics; economic growth; financial market; financial system; innovation; policy approach; real exchange rate; sustainable development; technological development; temporal variation; time series
"Financial development, institutions, and economic growth nexus: A spatial econometrics analysis using geographical and institutional proximities",2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148659833&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2791&partnerID=40&md5=cdf2f5e9bce1270833a49bf602cce457,"This paper investigates the nexus between financial development (FD), institutions, and economic growth using a spatial autoregressive model on a panel dataset of 82 countries from 1990 to 2019. We measure the dependence between countries through geographical and institutional proximity. The latter has not been widely explored in the finance-growth literature. The concept of institutional proximity proposes that countries with similar institutions will have similar levels of economic growth and larger spillovers once spatial effects of FD and institutional quality are controlled. Overall, our findings support this proposition, as FD and political institutions are shown to have significant positive effects on growth. However, the growth-effect of FD becomes negative beyond a certain threshold. We also find significant positive spatial lag growth in the model, indicating the presence of indirect spillover effects of FD and institutions on the growth of neighbouring countries in both geographical and institutional spheres. Furthermore, the spatial growth model with the institutional proximity matrix exhibits a higher rate of convergence and larger size of spillover than the model with geographical proximity. These findings are robust to various model specifications, and the paper concludes with some policy recommendations. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",economic growth; financial development; institutional proximity; spatial fixed effects; spatial lag model,econometrics; economic growth; finance; financial market; spillover effect
Deposit-borrowing substitutability: Evidence from microfinance institutions around the world,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160319191&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2817&partnerID=40&md5=dabfb7e8f88e84a4e57d1f34da4f1506,"Drawing from 645 microfinance institutions across 56 countries, this paper examines the deposit-borrowing dynamic of microfinance institutions' source of capital. We find that deposits and borrowings are substitutes rather than complements. We further find that the degree of substitutability is more pronounced among microfinance institutions operating in a developed financial sector where the level of information asymmetry is lower. Our findings represent novel contribution in understanding microfinance institutions' funding behaviour that supports its quest for further growth and long-term sustainability. © 2023 The Authors.

"Income distribution, financial liberalisations and banking stability: Theory and international evidence",2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151482816&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2809&partnerID=40&md5=74df988bb726692f31a1521e7392e541,"Motivated by Rajan's study and existing economic reform theories (especially the lobby theory), we highlight income inequality as a driver of financial liberalisations. However, no evidence yet supports this idea. To verify this liberalisation-induced-by-inequality hypothesis, the nexus of income inequality and financial liberalisations is formalised and empirically investigated in this paper. We utilise an ordered logit model with two-way fixed effects and panel data from 91 countries to conduct the analyses. The baseline empirical results indicate that income inequality is a positive and significant determinant of financial liberalisations in aggregate and three component indicators. The results for three component indicators remain stable after a series of robustness checks, including mitigating the potential endogeneity via IV-2SLS, Lewbel instrumental variable technique and difference within group, assessing the bias from the unobservable variables, considering the persistent and learning effects of liberalisations and the interaction effects, alternating the measures of income inequality, reducing business cycle, and using financial reforms rather financial liberalisation as independent variable. The results for aggregate liberalisations are slightly unstable in models with persistent and learning effects. Thus, liberalisation-induced-by-inequality hypothesis is generally confirmed. In addition, the impacts of income inequality on financial liberalisations are widely heterogeneous across countries, the rate of change in income inequality and wealth inequality could also predict the occurrence of financial liberalisations, and the evidence that income inequality makes the poor easier access credits (i.e., Rajan's hypothesis) is found. Finally, the role is investigated of financial liberalisations in shaping banking stability, and we find that financial liberalisations can enhance growth and lower financial risks. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",economic growth; financial liberalisations; income inequality; lobbying theory; Rajan's hypothesis; systemic banking crises,banking; economic growth; economic reform; financial market; income distribution; liberalization; theoretical study
People are people: A comparative analysis of risk attitudes across Europe,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162014734&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2837&partnerID=40&md5=b9fc7457fea9d19e94da36279fc124d2,"In this paper, we conduct a detailed examination of the determinants of attitudes to financial risk among retail investors in six European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). We find that respondents from the United Kingdom and Belgium are the most risk tolerant while those from Spain are the least. We observe remarkable similarities in the distributions of risk tolerance across countries despite cultural differences and considerable variations in the extent to which risky investing is undertaken as a routine part of financial planning. We further show that country effects in the cross-sectional variation of attitude to risk scores are swamped by the impacts of gender, salary and wealth, while financial knowledge and prior investment experience are much more important still. Our results have implications for regulators and those who wish to encourage European investors to consider going beyond bank savings and guaranteed products to more prevalent stock market investing in an era of negative real interest rates. © 2023 The Authors.

Capital flow deflection under the magnifying glass,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164342052&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2847&partnerID=40&md5=d394b5323678544b28024d8c12f12b38,"Leveraging on a new quarterly dataset of capital control adjustments, we find renewed evidence that the introduction or tightening of capital controls in one economy increases capital inflows to other similar borrowing economies, an effect often called capital flow deflection. However, not all flows are deflected alike. Capital flow deflection is primarily driven by portfolio investment and bank credit, and only controls targeting these types of flows generate this externality. Moreover, analysing bilateral capital flows in order to capture investing countries' characteristics, we find that capital controls tend to deflect flows from advanced economies' portfolio equity investors, while controls on bank-related flows primarily deflects lending from emerging market banks. © 2023 The Authors.

Gendered language and board diversity: Evidence from European banks,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153616373&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2823&partnerID=40&md5=a6435278273657684bf81a5f665af8fd,"Based on a sample of EU banks covering the period 2007 to 2021, I explore the impact of gendered language on bank board diversity policies. I find that gendered language negatively affects banks' gender diversity practices, especially after the passage of board reforms. Further, I find that rule of law and government efficiency explain the relationship, suggesting that these are useful mechanisms to reduce the negative effect of language gender-marking orientation on banks' gender diversity practices. However, results do not show a statistically significant effect of board gender diversity on riskiness of banks operating in countries with higher language gender orientation. My study provides a timely contribution to the literature by filling the gap regarding the importance of language gender-marking orientation in explaining banks' diversity practices and suggesting that regulators and institutions should take stronger actions aimed at reducing such cross-country heterogeneity. It also provides useful insights for EU regulators following the passage of the mandatory “Women on Boards” Directive in 2022. © 2023 The Authors.

The predictive power of commodity prices for future economic growth: Evaluating the role of economic development,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153507135&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2821&partnerID=40&md5=6a202eabcd4a5ec7d8e6b2a69d1cc15f,"This paper investigates the extent to which commodity prices can predict economic growth, the growth exposure of the countries to specific commodity group, and whether the country stage of development matters for growth dependency on commodities. We use a novel time-varying mixed-frequency vector autoregressive model to jointly estimate causality between monthly commodity prices and quarterly economic growth for the period from January 1980 to March 2020. Our findings suggest that growth dependency on commodities varies over time and across different synthetic measures, but in general solid evidence of predictability is determined. The overall commodity index shows better performance in predicting economic growth than the segregated proxies of either fuel or non-fuel commodities in developed economies. However, the overall commodity index is as effective as the fuel index in predicting economic growth for their developing counterparts. We develop a new index of global commodity growth connectivity (GCGCI) to determine the economic growth dependency on commodities over time. Our results show that economic growth dependency on commodities has increased at least three times with financialization of commodity markets. The GCGCI for all commodities reveals a higher growth dependency on commodities in developing countries than developed ones in the post-financialization period. Interestingly, we find that growth decreases its reliance on fuel commodities in both developed and developing countries after financialization of commodity markets. Our findings bear implications for policymakers to design stabilization policies in an attempt to protect economies vulnerable to commodity price shocks and lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth. © 2023 The Authors.

Most studies have explored whether board structure predicts firm outcomes rather than the other way around even though firm strategy plays a significant role in structuring the board. The sample covered the period between 2013 and 2018 and included 20,677 firm-year observations, on which we executed country-industry-year fixed-effects regression analysis. We found that, first, cost leadership strategy was positively associated with board size, board independence, board gender diversity, and board tenure, whereas it was negatively associated with board skills. Second, differentiation strategy was positively associated with board size and board gender diversity. Third, the moderating effects revealed that while board size and board tenure negatively moderated between cost leadership and firm value, board skills positively moderated between cost leadership and firm value. On the other hand, while board size, board gender diversity, and board tenure positively moderated between differentiation and firm value, board skills negatively moderated between differentiation and firm value. The results were robust to an alternative firm value proxy and endogeneity concerns. These findings provide firms with the opportunity to better shape their board structure in line with their corporate strategies and shareholder expectations. © 2023 The Authors.

Stock price informativeness and credit default swap trading,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152293982&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2813&partnerID=40&md5=04a87cd681ee06766f85507fc5d5d903,"This study develops a difference-in-differences analysis to assess whether trading onset of credit default swaps (CDS) on a firm's debt improves price informativeness in the stock market. Price informativeness is measured by the future earnings response coefficient, which captures the amount of information about future earnings conveyed in stock returns. Our sample comprises U.S. firms (firms experiencing CDS trading on their debt and a group of control firms) and covers the period 1997–2015. The results indicate that CDS hinder stock price informativeness, and thus the ability of prices to track long-term fundamentals, especially before the arrival of negative information about the obligor. The identified impact is stronger when CDS are first traded, becoming less pervasive with the passage of time. Finally, the results indicate that effects were residual during the early stages of CDS market development and peaked during the period 2004–2008. The impact of CDS introduction weakened after new regulation and ISDA protocols entry into force in 2009. This empirical analysis contributes to the literature by improving knowledge on the consequences of CDS trading on economic and financial outcomes. It points out a negative effect on price informativeness in the stock market and indicates that it was smoothed by regulatory measures designed to improve market infrastructure and transparency. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",credit default swaps; earnings; price informativeness,United States; credit provision; debt; price determination; stock market

Using a cross-sectional panel data of 23 African countries, spanning 1996–2020, this study applied a novel panel structural autoregressive model and a modification of the recently introduced dynamic threshold model to analyse the foreign direct investment (FDI)-growth-poverty relationship at sectoral level. The study accounted for heterogeneity, simultaneity bias and cross-sectional dependence in the modelling exercise. Findings suggest that shocks in FDI produced significant positive impact on manufacturing and services output performances in Africa in the short-term. However, shocks in FDI did not stimulate appreciable effect on agricultural output performance over time. Moreover, the results show that the effect of FDI shocks on human development index (HDI) was greater in the short- to medium-term than in the long-term. The threshold regression results suggest that higher levels of FDI inflow and HDI are needed for macroeconomic factors to produce significant positive effects on sectoral output performance. This study therefore provided some valuable recommendations to guide evidence-based policy making in Africa to improve sectoral output and welfare. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",FDI; panel structural vector autoregressive (PSVAR) model; poverty in Africa; sectoral output performance; threshold regression model,Africa; foreign direct investment; numerical model; performance assessment; policy making; poverty; regression analysis; vector
Star power as quality signal or marketing effect?

Artistic excellence was measured based on industry recognition; more specifically, the winners of seven major movie awards in the greater China region, which reflect the critical and popular evaluations of reviewers and consumers. The commercial success was measured by box office performance and the level of buzz among the audience. While the paths of artistic excellence and commercial movie success are essentially separable, as well as conceptually and empirically distinct, movie star power may influence both. Our findings indicate that star power had negative signal effects on critical and popular evaluation as well as industry recognition, but positive marketing effects on critical and popular buzz as well as box office performance. Indeed, star power has indirect positive effects that can outweigh its negative effects. Thus, star power is the key to success in these two seemingly unrelated paths in China. Moreover, these findings have several implications for international investors, producers, actors, and directors who are participating in the Chinese motion picture industry. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",critical and popular evaluation; industry recognition; market performance; star power; structural equation model,China; film industry; market conditions; marketing; numerical model; path analysis; regression analysis

We use daily observations for several bond maturities and CDS premium with reference to the core (France and Germany) versus periphery EMU countries (Portugal, Italy, Ireland Spain, and Greece) for the period 2009 to 2014. To measure global geopolitical risk, we employ the Caldara and Iacoviello (2022) global geopolitics index (GPR). Using alternative econometric approaches, we find adequate evidence of volatility spillovers between the geopolitical risk index and sovereign risk markets mainly during the crisis period (2009–2012) and weaker during the easing of the eurozone debt crisis period (2012–2014). Moreover, based on Granger causality the estimation of the short- term dynamics reveals a significant linkage during the post-crisis period rather than during crisis.

Oil prices and geopolitical risk: Fresh insights based on Granger-causality in quantiles analysis,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152047296&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2806&partnerID=40&md5=7df8560bc28a599c2edd1cf1c75a8e1a,"This study examines the causality relationship between oil price movements and geopolitical risks for a group of 18 geopolitically sensitive countries, using monthly data by implementing all quantiles distributions. Contrary to earlier studies, which have applied the Granger-causality through the conditional mean regression, this research estimates the association between the variables through Granger causality within quantiles. Evidence of a two-way causality is found linking the changes in geopolitical risk and fluctuations in oil prices in the case of Thailand, Argentina, Israel, China, Mexico India, Korea, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey, Philippines, Venezuela, Ukraine, and others. In addition, it is confirmed that oil prices Granger cause geopolitical risks for the countries like Brazil, Malaysia, and Colombia. Furthermore, a one-way causality direction is found from changes in geopolitical risk to shifts in oil prices in Russia and Saudi Arabia, which are observed as super oil rich states. This study findings highlight the importance of government policies and business strategies that aim at containing the effects of geopolitical risk and the resulting oil price movements. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",geopolitical risk; Granger causality in quantiles; oil prices,energy market; geopolitics; Granger causality test; oil supply; probability
Cash holdings and corruption prevention commitment: Evidence from the UK,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164136775&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2851&partnerID=40&md5=c1c84c8a0bf42e0b2fccaf1878126b64,"This study advances the literature in cash holdings in that it empirically examines the impact of corruption prevention commitment (CPC) on the cash holding strategic decisions and how such CPC might interact with cash holdings to affect firm value. We employ a sample of UK non-financial publicly listed firms and our results are of twofold. First, we detect a significant negative relationship between CPC and cash holdings, which is consistent with the expected governance effect of CPC. Second, we find a negative interaction of CPC with cash holdings when investigating cash holdings effect on firm value, suggesting that shareholders consider CPC as an overinvestment in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activity within a strong customer protection framework, such as the UK. Our findings are robust to different econometric estimations and controlling for different explanatory variables. This study offers beneficial perceptions into the notion of sustainability and sustainability standards and their implications on firms financing decisions. Finally, we argue that while this paper investigates the UK context, our results might be applicable to other countries with similar anti-corruption structure as in the UK. © 2023 The Authors.

Using the context of emerging markets and a large surveydataset drawn from the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS), we find robust evidence suggesting that gender-diverse manager-owner(s) teams are associated with higher odds of undertaking innovation. Specifically, women (men) owned firms managed by a male (female) top manager are associated with a higher likelihood of undertaking innovation relative to women (men) owned firms managed by women (men). Additionally, we find that female-owned firms run by male (female) top managers are the most (least) innovative and male-owned firms run by female (male) top managers are the second (third) innovative. Our findings indicate that heterophilic manager-owner(s) teams have the potential to foster innovation in emerging markets.

Investor attention and environmental information disclosure quality: Evidence from heavy pollution industries in China,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152658176&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2811&partnerID=40&md5=27e47a2de2772454f4d086965e2834ee,"Using listed firms from 16 heavy pollution industries in China, we show that investor attention can significantly improve the quality of corporate environmental information disclosure. By examining the heterogeneity effects of investor attention under different firm characteristics, locations, and external supervision, we reveal that this improvement effect is more pronounced for smaller firms, state-owned enterprises, firms with weaker corporate governance, and firms located in China's western regions (regions with poor economic development). We further find that public's attention to environmental issues promotes the investor attention level on firms in heavy pollution industries, thus improving firms' environmental information disclosure quality. Overall, our results emphasize the role of external investor attention on corporate environmental issues. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",China; environmental information disclosure; heavy pollution industries; investor attention,China; environmental economics; environmental issue; industrial emission; investment; small and medium-sized enterprise; state owned enterprise
Relating economic openness and export diversification to eco-efficiency: Is green innovation critical?,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85158126738&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2825&partnerID=40&md5=773d204c6caed5d6badb77a02f94f02e,"A critical debate on whether macro economies would achieve sustainability targets via green innovations could reach some informed consensus, given it is explicit how those innovations, directly and indirectly, interact with both economic and ecological systems through international economic activities. To unriddle this puzzle, this work is the initial attempt to examine how green innovation moderates the influence of economic openness and export diversification on eco-efficiency in selected 13 European Union (EU) economies from 1995 to 2014. We employ advanced second-generation econometric approaches robust to cross-section dependence, slope heterogeneity, and the omitted variable bias concerns in panel data. The main results are firstly, economic openness and export diversification tend to deteriorate eco-efficiency in the absence of a green innovation moderator. Secondly, in green innovation moderation models, both economic openness and export diversification are likely to improve eco-efficiency. Thirdly, green innovation not only directly promotes eco-efficiency but also positively moderates the influence of economic openness and export diversification on eco-efficiency. Fourthly, a one-way causality exists from green innovation moderators to eco-efficiency, while economic openness, export diversification, green innovation, and other control variables establish a two-way causal relationship with eco-efficiency. Finally, for green innovation in place, the policy shocks of economic openness and export diversification are predicted to achieve the eco-efficiency effects in more than 1 year in the EU members, while green innovation catalyses this convergence speed. Besides, economic openness and export diversification policies should be integrated with the green innovation framework to achieve eco-efficiency for sustainable development. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",eco-efficiency; economic openness; European Union; export diversification; green innovation; moderating role,Europe; economic diversification; export; innovation; sustainable development
Could the simultaneous persistence of greater cash holdings and interest-bearing debts affect stock price crash risk?,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85158926769&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2826&partnerID=40&md5=84ac2a2592f22e5c03eb52d250dbb740,"We study the impact of a unique financial anomaly—the simultaneous persistence of greater cash holdings and interest-bearing debts (SP-GCHID) on stock price. Due to institutional diversity and the nature of transition economies, high cash holdings do not always stem from precautionary motive as usually claimed but can be the result of cash misappropriation and debt manipulation by major shareholders. Analysing data from Chinese listed firms from 2010 to 2018, we find that SP-GCHID is associated with a higher stock price crash risk (SPCR). It is more evident among firms with major shareholders pledging their shares and firms exposed to more external information monitoring. SP-GCHID also affects SPCR through increasing real earnings management, further suggesting that major shareholders' misappropriation is the main reason for SP-GCHID's adverse effect. These findings are also robust in a range of endogenous tests. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the economic consequences of SP-GCHID. © 2023 The Authors.

Our analysis of five crisis-hit Asian countries shows that overinvestment via credit expansion and foreign financing has an adverse effect on banking sectors while income inequality contributes significantly to financial distress. With five no-crisis emerging markets included in our Asia analysis, we find that export-oriented growth backed up by domestic savings is financially less risky than investment-led growth facilitated by capital inflows. Since such different strategies of output growth to deal with falling demand are related ultimately to the same factor–rising inequality, this distributional problem must be overcome effectively to enhance financial stability and ensure growth sustainability. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Asia; bank credit; financial crisis; growth strategy; income inequality; investment and saving,Asia; banking; credit provision; economic growth; financial crisis; financial system; investment

Combining Random Regression Forests, a machine-learning process, with an agent-based model, we perform simulations on artificial economies with various degrees of adoption of peer-to-peer lending. We find that as peer-to-peer lenders proliferate, there is increased financial instability, lower GDP and higher unemployment. On the other hand, peer-to-peer lending increases the total volume of loans given out but demonstrates a preference towards consumer loans (over corporate loans), which has a negative effect in the long run. Finally, introducing peer-to-peer lenders increases the access of the unbanked to services which conventional banking is not able to offer within the extant regulatory framework.

(2022) are taken into account. Our findings uncover a negative connectedness between Bitcoin prices and the key selected uncertainty indices, suggesting that higher uncertainties result in lower Bitcoin fluctuation across time and frequency domains.

Contrary to expectations, we find that the relationship between corruption and trade with Africa is the same for both countries. Africa's trade with China and the USA increases as corruption increases. Our results imply that both countries have a similar trend of trading with African countries, and they might not care about corruption in Africa. Ultimately, both countries engage with Africa for their parochial economic and political interest.

Though the Efficient Market Theory suggests that stock prices fully reflect all available information, few existing studies indicate that Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) portfolios deliver superior risk-adjusted performance. ESG investing is at a nascent stage in India but is growing rapidly, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Asset managers always face the dilemma of choosing between different screening methods, screening intensities and stock weighting schemes to deliver outperformance. Our study attempts to investigate the impact of these portfolio construction criteria on the risk-adjusted performance of ESG portfolios in India. Our results show that there exists a trade-off between superior investment performance and unsystematic risk of ESG portfolios. Investors can benefit from investing in equally-weighted best-in-class portfolios constructed using ESG scores.

First, an ARDL dynamic panel model is estimated using the PMG method to analyse monthly data covering the most recent period (2019M1–2021M12); then, the GMM and PCSE approaches are applied to a much longer span of quarterly data (2000Q1–2021Q4), which also includes the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007–2009, in order to compare the trade impact of two different crises. The findings based on the monthly data provide clear evidence of the significant negative effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on both exports and imports in both the short and the long run, and also suggest that digitalisation was instrumental in mitigating the impact of the crisis and speeding up the recovery. The quarterly analysis over a longer time period indicates that both the GFC and the Covid-19 pandemic had negative effects on trade but of a different magnitude. The use of digital technology enabling remote work and e-commerce are again some of the factors likely explaining why international trade fell by less and also rebounded much more quickly during the Covid-19 pandemic compared to the GFC. © 2023 The Authors.

The determination to curtail the unwavering ravaging impacts of global warming motivates the 26th edition of the Conference of the Parties (COP26). Hence, this study examines explicitly how prominent factors discussed at COP26, such as technological innovation and green energy, will enhance the deliverance of the targets for Africa. While capturing environmental sustainability with CO2 emissions and ecological footprint, the empirical model endogenizes structural change, government expenditures and financial development from 1990 to 2018. The verification of stated hypotheses relies on the cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) model, augmented mean group (AMG), common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG) and method of moment quantile regression (MMQR) model. Our empirical results reveal that technological innovation, green energy and service-led growth promote environmental sustainability by mitigating the surge in CO2 emissions and ecological footprint. Besides, government expenditures, financial development, agriculture and manufacturing hinder environmental sustainability.

Further analyses suggest that the positive association is more salient for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Moreover, the path analysis provides evidence for the mediating effect of non-financial information disclosure and corporate governance quality on the relationship between D&O insurance and ESG performance.

Our findings suggest that digital financial inclusion can reduce the risk of Chinese families returning to poverty, and that it has heterogeneous effects on families and regions with different characteristics. The main function is to improve household income level by promoting entrepreneurship and employment, and to improve risk resistance by enhancing household financial market participation and household asset allocation. Further analysis shows that digital financial inclusion has structural effects, nonlinear effects, and substitution effects with private lending in poverty governance.

Our dataset consists of daily prices spanning from January 2017 through to October 2022, encapsulating pre- and post-epidemic eras. Generally, our findings suggest that Tether presents the least overall volatility throughout the time-frequency spectrum. USD Coin demonstrates ephemeral turbulence, contrary to Tether's maturity in influencing market equilibrium through token issuance and trade responses. In the post-epidemic sample, both stablecoins indicate mean reversion, with USD Coin showing marginally better efficiency. Conversely, investment tokens display persistent clusters due to retail traders and long-term fundamental institutions. Although both tokens illustrate multifractal volatility, Ethereum unveils more essence of self-similarity than Bitcoin. Hence, there is no evidence that Ethereum truly duplicates Bitcoin since policy-related events differ between them, as both return series move incongruously. Conditional dynamics signify that all cryptocurrencies, except Tether, were affected by the pandemic transition of COVID-19 and subsequent macroeconomic news. The unconditional volatility of stablecoins evinces zero-mean errors, antithetical to investment tokens exhibiting annual cycles. The fractal geometry suggests that investment tokens simulate one-dimensional lines, whereas stablecoins mimic two-dimensional planes. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",bitcoin; cryptocurrency; efficiency; Ethereum; Stablecoin; token; volatility; wavelet,currency market; financial market; financial system; investment; macroeconomics; wavelet analysis

Furthermore, the estimated regimes coincide with financial crises and economic downturns, thus confirming the procyclical behaviour of mutual funds' returns.

Recent finance literature confirms the integration of cryptocurrencies and financial assets, which may bring more investments with the possibility of surplus liquidity in the cryptocurrency segment, leading to financial instability. The novelty of this paper is examining the integration of cryptocurrencies and the indices of equity, sustainability, renewable energy, and crude oil for the daily observations from 2015 to 2021 by using the wavelet coherency method. The empirical results signify no integration in the short-term scales and grow stronger in the medium-term scales, especially during the COVID-19 period, and further exhibit weaker heterogeneous associations in the long-term scales. However, the sustainability, clean energy indices follow similar dynamics of the equity market and crypto pairs. In contrast, the global crude oil index showcases the minor integration with cryptocurrencies compared with other traditional asset classes. Hence, the cryptocurrency market fails to confirm the safe haven features, especially during the COVID-19 periods (Medium-term), which facilitate the domestic and international investors expecting to hedge their price risk in equity markets using cryptocurrencies may have to look for short-term.

Can market information outperform hard and soft information in predicting corporate defaults?,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161999256&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2840&partnerID=40&md5=2289de4f2cebe2aba7ed0480ad674c56,"Recent evidence has shown that hybrid models for credit ratings are important when assessing the risk of firms. Within this stream of literature, we aim to provide novel evidence on how hard (quantitative), soft (qualitative), and market information predict corporate defaults for unlisted firms by implementing the Cox proportional hazard model. We address this research question by exploiting a unique proprietary dataset comprising of detailed information on internal credit ratings of European unlisted mid-sized firms and compute their Merton's distance-to-default (DD) measure of credit risk with market data collected on comparable publicly listed companies. Our results show that the bank's use of hard, soft, and market information when assessing the credit ratings of borrowers has a significant influence on the prediction of their defaults. Further, we investigate the significant influence of soft information in predicting corporate defaults by drawing on two separate processes through which loan officers can inject soft information in credit scoring, that is, ‘codified’ and ‘uncodified’ discretion. Finally, when we distinguish between the loan officer's discretion to upgrade or downgrade an applicant's credit score, we find that it is the upgrade that is likely to predict a lower probability of a firm defaulting. This study contributes to the policy debate on safeguarding the banking sector's continuity by positing that integrating market information into banks' hybrid methods of credit rating helps to improve the accuracy in predicting unlisted firms' credit risk that is useful to policy makers for the design of future forward-looking financial risk management frameworks. © 2023 The Authors.

The finance–inequality nexus in the era of financialisation: Evidence for Portugal,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163069000&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2848&partnerID=40&md5=2a73a3274578f9fd6608999a4a58ce47,"Since the 1980s, Portuguese policy makers have engaged in a strong process of liberalization, deregulation and privatization of the financial system to adhere to the rules imposed by the European Economic Community and to promote financial growth, boost economic growth and reduce inequality. However, the Portuguese economic growth has exhibited a weaker performance and inequality has continued to widen in the last decades, a situation that seems to contradict the mainstream beliefs regarding the supportive role played by financial growth in the era of financialisation. This article undertakes an empirical assessment of the finance–inequality nexus by performing a time series econometric analysis for Portugal from 1980 to 2020 through the estimation of both linear and non-linear models. It finds strong evidence for a positive (linear) relationship between finance and inequality and some evidence for a convex quadratic (non-linear) relationship between finance and inequality in Portugal, corroborating the hypothesis that the financial growth has been prejudicial, enhancing inequality in Portugal. These findings highlight the urgent need to abandon the so-called ‘trickle-down theory’ or the ‘horse and sparrow theory’ and to implement the so-called ‘trickle-up theory’ with the support of pro-poor public policies to decrease inequality in Portugal. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",financial growth; financialisation; generalized method of moments estimator; inequality; Portugal; time series,Portugal; capitalism; econometrics; economic growth; financial market
Returns and volatility connectedness among the Eurozone equity markets,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85156139495&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2816&partnerID=40&md5=48d8c26916da85a0844aa4bb67f6db83,"The rising degree of integration among different countries around the world calls for the examination of cross-country connectedness across equity markets. Moreover, the interconnection among some countries – bound by their common economic policies, treaties and agreements, such as Eurozone countries – is stronger than among others. Strong inter-country ties may cause an intense connectedness among their financial systems. This study examines the returns and volatility connectedness among the equity markets of the Eurozone countries. Using the TVP-VAR model, we document strong connectedness among their stock markets. The net transmitters of shocks are the most developed Eurozone stock markets, while Lithuania, Slovenia and Slovakia are among the most vulnerable to risks from the more developed Eurozone economies. Thus, for any event that triggers risk transmission across the Eurozone equity markets, equity investors in less developed countries will be more vulnerable to risks from the nine more developed economies. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",cross-country connectedness; Eurozone stock markets; return and volatility spillover; risk transmission; shocks transmitters and receivers; TVP-VAR model,Lithuania; Slovakia; Slovenia; financial system; spillover effect; stock market; vector autoregression

In this article, we draw upon the literature on volatility forecasting and hybrid models to construct the Hybrid-long short-term memory (LSTM) models to forecast the intraday realized volatility in three major US stock indexes. We construct the hybrid models by combining one or multiple traditional time series models with the LSTM model, and incorporating either the estimated parameters, or the predicted volatility, or both from the statistical models as additional input values into the LSTM model. We perform the out-of-sample test of our Hybrid-LSTM models in volatility forecasting during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) period. Empirical results show that the Hybrid-LSTM models can still significantly improve the volatility forecasting performance of the LSTM model during the COVID-19 period. By analysing how the construction methods may influence the forecasting performance of the Hybrid-LSTM models, we provide some suggestions on their design. Finally, we identify the optimal Hybrid-LSTM model for each stock index and compare its performance with the LSTM model on each day during our sample period. We find that the Hybrid-LSTM models' great capability of capturing market dynamics explains their good performance in forecasting. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",COVID-19; Hybrid-long short-term memory model; stock market volatility; volatility forecasting,United States; COVID-19; financial market; forecasting method; numerical model; stock market; time series analysis

Then, we quantify the contribution of each of the variables included in the model to explain the evolution of these flows in each month of the sample through a historical decomposition analysis. The main results indicate that the contribution of global risk aversion to explain the evolution of debt flows increased during March 2020 compared to the past, although its relative importance has decreased since, particularly as central banks in systemically important economies restored liquidity and the performance of financial markets improved. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",capital flows; COVID-19; emerging economies; global risk aversion; historical decomposition; vector autoregression,capital flow; central bank; COVID-19; debt crisis; financial market; financial services
An unrestricted MIDAS ordered logit model with applications to credit ratings,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149248509&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2801&partnerID=40&md5=640d7877c196c75f1d0b4e75574c7478,"The ordered logit (OLogit) model is a regression model for an ordinal dependent variable. For a conventional time series OLogit model, both the dependent variable and the independent variables are required to be observed at the same frequency. However, this requirement is violated under the circumstance of mixed frequency data. To this end, we introduce the unrestricted MIDAS (U-MIDAS) method into the OLogit model and develop a novel U-MIDAS-OLogit model, in which high-frequency covariates are used to predict a low-frequency outcome with ordinal categories. The U-MIDAS-OLogit model enlarges the application of OLogit and enables to produce timely forecast. To verify its effectiveness, we conduct extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The numerical results show that the U-MIDAS-OLogit model is superior to several typical OLogit models in terms of prediction performance. We then apply the U-MIDAS-OLogit model to predict credit ratings of listed companies in China and the US, respectively. The empirical results also confirm its promising in practical applications. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",credit rating; mixed frequency; multiclass classification; ordered logit model; U-MIDAS; U-MIDAS-OLogit,credit provision; empirical analysis; financial system; forecasting method; logit analysis
SMEs' diversification of financing sources: Strategy or desperation?,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85158057673&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2822&partnerID=40&md5=aba05d7feb565bfea517c3e93a399001,"The paper's objective is to provide a large sample evidence on small and medium enterprises' (SMEs) financing source diversification patterns. We use the large World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) sample of SMEs from 135 developing and emerging economies. We find that the extent of financing source diversification is significantly affected by firm-specific and country-specific characteristics. Commonly, (unconstrained) SMEs specialise their financing in retained earnings. However, SMEs experiencing financial constraints often rely on diversified financing sources. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence of a quadratic relationship between financial constraints and financing source diversification: SMEs experiencing a moderate degree of financial constraints use the most diversified sources of financing. This finding, combined with the evidence that financially unconstrained SMEs use fewer financing sources, suggests that diversification of financing sources by SMEs is a strategic choice based on the optimal complementarity of financing sources achieved through the credit multiplier channel. © 2023 The Authors.

Based on the daily trading and price data for individual companies from 2006 to 2021, we construct a novel ISI, which has robust predicting ability for the aggregate stock market return, in comparison to other popular measures of sentiment in the contemporary finance literature. Furthermore, the sentiment-based factor in this paper captures the small firm effect that the asset pricing modelling, containing the more topical Fama–French five factor modelling (5F-FF), has struggled to illuminate completely. Given that our results have shown Korean stock market as fairly well-organised in terms of the availability of the market intelligence, we speculate our results to have important managerial implications for financial regulators in Korea and countries holding similar economic features. © 2023 The Authors.

The positive effect on M&A announcement returns is the result of increased investor sentiment after market liberalisation. It is the investor sentiment mechanism through which stock market liberalisation has effects on M&A short-term returns. Further analysis indicates that stock market liberalisation does not impose positive effects on long-term M&A outcomes.

Literature also confirms the instrumentality of the board structure (measured as size, diversity, independence and CEO duality) in overcoming the agency problem. In this context, the present study examines the impact of board structure on a firm's cash holding (CH) levels. Likewise, the study tests the role of cash-holding (CH) in the association between board structure and a firm's performance. Secondary data from 262 PSX-listed manufacturing and servicing sector firms have been taken for analysis. Panel regression and Generalized Methods of Movement (GMM) were employed to test the modelled relationships. Results show that most of the CG variables, that is, CEO duality, board size, executive compensation, and diversity, do not affect a firm's CH levels in the service and manufacturing sectors. However, the results display a negative and significant impact of block holders (BH), measured as the ratio of the top five shareholders, on cash holding in manufacturing. Likewise, the sector-wise analysis shows that cash holding significantly mediates between board size and ROA. In contrast, its role between other dimensions of CG and RoA was insignificant. The findings also revealed that firms with frailer CG structures tend to have less CH and can be prone to external environmental risk. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",cash holding; corporate governance; firm performance; manufacturing firms; servicing firms,corporate strategy; firm size; governance approach; manufacturing; performance assessment; service sector

Effects of monetary policy credibility and the open economy trilemma on monetary policy efficiency,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143212424&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2737&partnerID=40&md5=09b5b6efc21ef8a9150914cc97fe9f5c,"This study investigates the effects of monetary policy credibility and the open economy trilemma on monetary policy efficiency in developing countries. Based on a sample of 28 developing countries, the findings reveal that monetary policy credibility increases monetary policy efficiency. The results also show that central banks in developing countries have more efficient monetary policies when they choose a policy arrangement contrary to the ‘middle-ground convergence’; but, to the extent they accumulate international reserves, it allows them to move to a middle-ground strategy. Regarding the trilemma, the estimates suggest when monetary policy is independent, monetary policy is more efficient. Furthermore, when financial openness and exchange rate stability are deepened, central banks become less efficient in conducting monetary policy. However, when countries hold higher levels of international reserves, the positive effect of monetary autonomy on monetary policy efficiency decreases and the negative effect of financial liberalisation on monetary policy efficiency decreases. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",credibility; exchange rate regime; financial liberalisation; impossible trinity; international reserves; monetary policy efficiency,autonomy; central bank; developing world; economic system; exchange rate; liberalization; monetary policy
Why do corporate social responsibility-oriented companies opt for bond debt?

The information asymmetry channel supports that CSR helps firms exhibit more transparency and thereby opt for bond debt. On the other side, the monitoring channel stipulates that CSR makes managers less inclined to engage in value-diverting activity which makes worthless the scrutiny of banks' monitoring. Results hold after conducting a series of robustness tests and a cross-sectional heterogeneity analysis at the country level. In addition, the positive relationship between CSR and bond debt is tested in the pre- during- and post- global financial crisis. The relation is more pronounced (i) during periods of uncertainty, (ii) for countries with better informational environment and (iii) for countries with higher levels of agency costs. Overall, our findings are of interest to managers, investors, and policymakers as they show the benefits of CSR commitment during crisis periods marked by a strong need for trust and for more responsible finance. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",bank loans; bond debt; corporate social responsibility; crisis periods; information asymmetry; monitoring; uncertainty,asymmetric information; banking; corporate social responsibility; debt; financial crisis; monitoring

To estimate the long-run coefficients, the Driscoll-Kraay standard errors, panel corrected standard errors and feasible generalised least squares estimators are applied. The Dumitrescu-Hurlin bootstrap causality test is used to examine the causal linkages among the variables. It is found that there exists cointegration between the variables. It is also found that technological innovation, economic growth and financial globalisation positively affect financial development while natural resources decrease it in the long run. The findings reveal that technological innovation and financial development cause each other.

Our empirical evidence based on several regression models shows association between firms' CSR performance and disclosure, which supports the signalling story, and hence, casts doubt on the greenwashing behaviour among UK firms on social media. Our findings suggest several implications for researchers, shareholders, and practitioners as the relation between CSR disclosure on influential, widely reached platforms such as social media and CSR performance carries important indications about the credibility of the content of such disclosure, the extent to which it reflects actual CSR performance, and hence its usefulness for all stakeholders interested in CSR. The true motive behind CSR disclosures can greatly influence how stakeholders perceive such information and the extent to which they can rely on it for decision making purposes. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",corporate social responsibility; greenwashing; machine learning; signalling theory; Twitter,United Kingdom; corporate social responsibility; environmentalism; green economy; industrial performance; machine learning; performance assessment; social media; unsupervised classification

We find that the group of large banks has higher levels of efficiency and that there are still opportunities for improvement in the group of medium and small banks. We also estimate that 80% of Ecuadorian banks need to make potential improvements either by increasing their output or reducing their inputs, such as salary costs, to increase the efficiency. In addition, the growth of the banking sector is crucial to achieve the financial development in Ecuador, being significant the efficiency indices, which show that a 1% increase in banking efficiency could increase its size by USD 605 million. By using the random effects panel data econometric model, we demonstrate that the growth of the banking industry is mostly influenced by the concentration of deposits and taxes. © 2023 The Authors.

Which implied volatilities contain more information? Evidence from China,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145501187&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2764&partnerID=40&md5=5683859d617abae6e1a5b6cae9e010bb,"This paper aims to examine the information capacity of implied volatility (IV) estimated with model-based and model-free methods. Among the model-free approaches, we further divide them into direct estimation (DE) and indirect estimation (INDE) approaches according to the computational process. We study the predictability of different implied volatilities on realized volatility over various forecasting horizons based on the Chinese option data. The out-of-sample results indicate that all the IVs contain the information transmitted by option market, and have predictive ability on the realized volatility. Using three different loss functions, we find that the implied volatilities estimated with DE approach contain more information. When considering different market scenarios, we find model-based implied volatility performs best during the stable period and the DE approach always works well no matter the investor sentiment is normal or abnormal. Moreover, we also discuss the predictability of implied volatility on crash risk. Our results remain robust by using alternative realized volatility and alternative rolling windows. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",crash risk; implied volatility; information capacity; SSE 50ETF option; volatility prediction,China; estimation method; information; investment; market conditions; prediction
Inventory information arrival and the crude oil futures market,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144227064&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2747&partnerID=40&md5=ab7c56b39fdffd1fbd0f92de7e0e946b,"The objective of this paper is to provide a deeper insight into the impact of weekly inventory announcements and especially their associated surprises on crude oil returns and volatility during the period from 27 March 2012 to 2 October 2018. The results can be summarized as follows. First, we find that all inventory surprises exert an inverse impact on the oil price returns. Such impact appears more pronounced during the collapse and post-collapse periods, than during the pre-collapse period. Second, we show that the reducing volatility effects of inventory shocks that we establish for the whole period are entirely attributed to those observed in the pre-collapse period. Third, the different effects obtained for positive and negative shocks support evidence that our split of inventory news by nature matters. Fourth, compared to macroeconomic and unconventional monetary news, the inventory statements appear as the most pertinent news during the event window. Fifth, we find evidence also that the effect of the uncertainty about economic stance, when it is significant, changes the way the oil prices and volatility react to inventory surprises, and hence weakens the effectiveness of the inventory policy. Lastly, we make an original use of the information content of the implied volatility to assess the persistence of the link between the conditional variance and the inventory news. The central finding is that the implied volatility enters with a significant effect on the conditional variance for WTI oil returns and namely with a reduced volatility persistence. Also, a significant effect from inventory surprises namely when we split the announcements into negative and positive news is detected even the implied volatility is introduced exogenously in the GARCH-type variance specification highlighting the predominance of our main variable. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",API; conditional volatility; inventory surprises; oil futures prices,crude oil; future prospect; macroeconomics; monetary policy; uncertainty analysis
Board gender diversity and the cost of equity: What difference does gender quota legislation make?,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146925817&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2774&partnerID=40&md5=d2c5c3d3e064de69731b250cb66700bb,"This study examines the relationship between women directors and the cost of equity (COE). Investigating the French firm's sample, we find a significant negative effect of women directors on the COE. Our results also document that the effect of women directors on reducing the COE is significant for firms that have a critical mass of at least four women directors. Using the difference-in-difference (DID) and propensity score matching (PSM) approach, we find that the relationship between female directors and lower equity costs is significant for the period following the Copé–Zimmermann gender quota law. The results show that women directors' presence on corporate boards is also supported by economic reasons.

"Volatility spillovers, hedging and safe-havens under pandemics: All that glitters is not gold!",2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143297588&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2738&partnerID=40&md5=e6b499f01055dfefbca6abec52cdc2f5,"In the context of the COVID-19's outbreak and its implications for the financial sector, this study analyses the aspect of hedging and safe-haven under the pandemic. Drawing on the daily data from 02 August 2019 to 17 April 2020, our key findings suggest that the contagious effects in financial assets' returns significantly increased under COVID-19, indicating exacerbated market risk. The connectedness spiked in the middle of March, consistent with lockdown timings in major economies. The effect became severe with the WHO's declaration of a pandemic, confirming negative news effects. The return connectedness suggests that COVID-19 has been a catalyst of contagious effects on the financial markets. The crude oil and the government bonds are however not as much affected by the spillovers as their endogenous innovation. In terms of spillovers, we do find the safe-haven function of Gold and Bitcoin. Comparatively, the safe-haven effectiveness of Bitcoin is unstable over the pandemic. Whereas, GOLD is the most promising hedge and safe-haven asset, as it remains robust during the current crisis of COVID-19 and thus exhibits superiority over Bitcoin and Tether. Our findings are useful for investors, portfolio managers and policymakers interested in spillovers and safe havens during the current pandemic. © 2022 The Authors.

How bank-specific factors affect access to financing for small and medium enterprises: Evidence from an emerging economy,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146191125&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2771&partnerID=40&md5=0465772e7d149b25f3b071a365087a52,"In this study, hypotheses were tested regarding the impact of bank size, ownership structure, branch location, and distress condition on access to financing for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The empirical analysis was conducted using data obtained from scheduled banks of Bangladesh (banks listed under the Bangladesh Bank Order, 1972) and SMEs operating in Bangladesh. The results suggest that SMEs in Bangladesh have greater access to financing when their application for financing is made to a small bank, a domestic private bank, or a rural branch. Bank distress appears to have a negative impact on the provision of financing to SMEs. SME access to financing is also lower if the application is made to a state-owned bank or a foreign bank. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",access to financing; Bangladesh; bank financing; distress bank; foreign bank; private bank; rural branch; SME; state-owned bank,Bangladesh; banking; empirical analysis; finance; rural area; small and medium-sized enterprise; state owned enterprise
Forecasting the Asian stock market volatility: Evidence from WTI and INE oil futures,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144163774&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2745&partnerID=40&md5=55a0039ab701dfba804a9c6d04602894,"This study investigates whether China's crude oil futures (INE) and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) markets hold valuable information for estimating the realized volatility of seven Asian stock markets. This study has several notable findings. First, China's oil futures can trigger forecast accuracy for three equity indices (Nikkei 225, NSEI, and FT Straits Times), whereas WTI helps forecast the volatility of the two indices (KSE 100 and KOSPI). Second, comparing China's crude oil futures with WTI's crude oil futures, we find that the former could be an effective indicator for all seven Asian stock markets during a high-volatility period, while WTI information is helpful in forecasting the volatility of the KSE 100, NSEI, and FT Strait Times during the low-volatility period. Further, information of both oil futures is ineffective for the Hang Seng and SSEC equity indices. Our results are robust in several robustness checks, including alternative evaluation methods, recursive window approach, and alternative realized measures, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Asian stock markets; crude oil futures; ENI; high-frequency data; realized volatility forecasting; WFI,China; crude oil; forecasting method; market conditions; pandemic; stock market

The results show that markets are more closely linked at extreme risk, and the spillover is time-varying and cyclical. The impact of extreme events will strengthen the links between markets. Further research shows different clean energy have heterogeneous spillovers on the carbon market, especially when impacted by extreme events. Finally, the hedging and portfolio effectiveness of clean energy to carbon market also show the existence of heterogeneity, and clean energy can diversify the portfolio of carbon market. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",carbon market; clean energy; extreme risk; portfolio; spillover effect,carbon emission; energy market; fossil; heterogeneity; risk assessment; spillover effect; vector autoregression

We find that AHVR positively predicts the expected stock returns and significantly relates to firms' quality-related fundamental information, especially profitability. Foreign investors learn the firm fundamentals before they invest in the Chinese market, which is different from the trading behaviour of domestic individual investors. The AHVR premium is larger among firms with higher attention of analysts who focus on effective information and with lower attention of individual investors who have behavioural bias. In all, the northbound inflows are smart money, which will increase the efficiency of the Chinese market instead of simply chasing stars that only grab investors' attention. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",abnormal holding value ratio; Chinese stock market; firm quality; stock connect mechanism,China; financial market; industrial enterprise; stock market

In order to explore whether the recent debt crisis in EU has affected the harmonisation path, the paper, for the first time, considers both the whole period 2002–2019 and two equally-sized sub-periods, that is, 2002–2009 and 2012–2019, which correspond to pre-and post-debt-crisis years. The issue is important for the debate on fiscal harmonisation in Europe, given that the EU's debt crisis has generated many asymmetries across the member states, whilst the design of effective public policies remains a key tool for achieving higher economic growth. Overall, our results provide evidence of divergence, especially for public expenditures since the European debt crisis, which suggests that in the future further efforts towards a stronger harmonisation path will be required by policymakers in EU member states. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",club convergence method; European Union; fiscal harmonisation; panel convergence; public expenditures; public revenues,Europe; cluster analysis; convergence; debt crisis; economic growth; European Union; public spending
Ranking of countries based on multi-dimensional financial inclusion index: A global perspective,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143430097&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2735&partnerID=40&md5=3d1a0bdbe3c2a930cc9a56c23c3eddd6,"This article has proposed a new five-dimensional financial inclusion index (FII) incorporating important indicators of digital financial services and insurance services to evaluate the scenario of financial inclusion across 136 countries for the year 2017. Here, dimensions have been created depending upon the characteristics of variables. To carry out the analysis, we have used the two-stage principal component method. First, all five dimension indices (geographic outreach, demographic outreach, access, usage population, and usage volume) have been constructed, and then finally, the composite FII has been computed. One important addition in building this index is the inclusion of insurance-related and digital finance-related variables, which have not been included in previous cross-country studies. Another contribution of this study is the identification of the dimension(s) that ultimately have the greatest influence on the financial inclusion score. We discovered that dimensions (access and usage population) constructed based on demand-side factors dominate the level of financial inclusion. Therefore, top-ranking countries in the access and usage population index are more likely to score higher than others in the FII. This underlines the relevance of demand-side factors as indicators of financial inclusion over supply-side factors. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",digital finance; financial inclusion; insurance; multi-dimensional financial inclusion index; principle component analysis,demand-side management; financial system; insurance system; principal component analysis; ranking

In a short period of time, researchers have begun to analyse the effect of the pandemic on global stock markets. Although the most known measurements of COVID-19 are the number of new cases and deaths, there are more robust indicators. In particular, the effective reproductive number is one of the most important indicators to analyse the pandemic which indicates the degree to which the spread is under control. In this paper, we assess the impact that the Effective Reproductive Number (Rt) has on 26 countries around the world (32 stock market indexes) comparing the performance of various forms of Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models. The results demonstrate that of the 32 stock markets analysed, 37.5% had a negative effect with respect to Rt and only in 12.5% of the cases was the effect of the variation of Rt positive. This implies that in more than a third of the stock markets analysed as the pandemic progressed uncontrolled the result was a decrease in the value of the market index. The 11 of the 26 countries analysed had a negative and significant effect (Brazil, Germany, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Russia, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, and United States). Findings suggest that the Effective Reproductive Number volatility had a significant impact on 10 of the 26 countries analysed (38.5%) (Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Italy, Mexico, Russia, Singapore and United Kingdom). © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",COVID19; effective reproductive number; Garch models; stock markets; volatility,COVID-19; economic impact; global economy; stock market; time series analysis

However, these goals cannot be achieved unless money is mobilised to finance climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts across the world. In response, various manifestations of green bonds have appeared in the market and these are considered as a bridge to the achievement of the SDGs – this is because climate mitigation and adaptation are integral to successful implementation of the SDGs. Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model, Fama–French Three Factor, Carhart Four Factor and Fama–French Five Factor pricing models, our study provides empirical evidence that the announcement of green bonds issuance lead to positively abnormal return on stocks. We divided our dataset into two parts. The first part of the dataset is from 01/01/2013 to 30/06/2018 and later part analyses the period from 01/07/2018 to 30/06/2022.

When we split the data on the basis of listing status, we observe that cash flow is positively (negatively) and significantly related to intangible assets (tangible assets) investments for private firms but not so for public firms. In addition, we further observe that both public and private firms' investments follow a similar pattern when we split our data based on the availability of internal funds. Moreover, we also find that the sensitivity of investment (identifiable intangible assets) to cash flow is higher for young and large private firms but lower for small and old ones.

Our empirical results have been estimated with a panel-corrected standard error method (PSCE) and they have been confirmed by several alternative techniques. First, the increase of internet usage and mobile usage has a significant negative effect on total and inter-continental trade balances while these factors improve the intra-African trade balances. Second, better institutions appear to have a negative impact on the total-, inter-, and intra-African trade balances – in other words, better institutions appear to stimulate imports rather than exports. This observation explains the decreasing trends in the current account balances of African countries. Third, the combined effect of the three factors (institutions, internet, and mobile use together) has a significant positive impact on all trade balances: total-, inter-, and intra-continental. Our study shows that an improvement in institutional quality acts as a mitigating factor for any negative impact internet\mobile development might cause on the trade balances of African countries. Further, our analysis examines the influence of institutions, internet usage, and mobile usage on the two parts of the trade: exports and imports. We observe that internet and mobile can influence negatively and differently impact the two wings of the balance trade. However, all improvements in institutions and their associations with internet usage and mobile usage have a significant positive impact on the trade balance especially on exporting activities of African countries. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Africa; export; import; institutional quality; internet usage; mobile usage; trade balance,Africa; developing world; export; import; institutional framework; Internet; mobile phone; trade flow; trend analysis
Investment under uncertainty and irreversibility: Evidence from the shipping markets,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146393023&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2779&partnerID=40&md5=65fddc53ab24abd673592c3724fb5124,"This paper investigates whether uncertainty and irreversibility affect new investments for high-value real assets. We examine ocean-going vessels and show that heightened uncertainty reduces both the likelihood of investment triggering and the magnitude of investment spending, conditional on triggering. These effects are more pronounced under an illiquid secondary ship market and a high price discount when reselling the vessel. We also show that uncertainty regarding the global economy and vessel-specific earnings affect the investment decision, but the amplifying effect of investment reversibility operates only through global economic uncertainty. Our work is novel as it models periods of investment inactivity and examines investors' behaviour across vessel segments. © 2023 The Authors.

Corporate social responsibility disclosure and corporate creditworthiness: Evidence from the UK,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143240521&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2733&partnerID=40&md5=ab1845b345f1831fbb96ac1edb372d9d,"This study investigates the way in which corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices are perceived by the U.K. bond market. In this respect, we distinguish between the two ambiguous subdimensions – that is, CSR disclosure and CSR performance. We analysed the association between CSR disclosure and the cost of corporate bonds by means of a multi-theoretical framework combining economics with social theories. We also examine the moderating effect of the CSR performance on this relationship. We estimate a random-effects GLS regression and random-effects ordered probit regression using a sample of companies belonging to the FTSE 100 index during the 2013–2017 period. We find that bondholders and credit rating agencies incorporate CSR disclosure into their assessment and evaluation of the firms' creditworthiness. Mainly, our results show that bondholders encourage and value CSR reporting primarily for companies with weak CSR performance, but stop doing so once the company reach a certain level of CSR performance. We further examined each CSR disclosure subdimension and aspects of corporate creditworthiness through a disaggregated analysis. Both environmental and community relations disclosures are significant in corporate creditworthiness, whereas only responsibility disclosure is related to credit ratings. Finally, results highlight that disclosure of CSR information is especially relevant to financially healthy firms. Our findings have several implications for academics, practitioners, and policymakers in understanding the consequences of CSR disclosure and CSR performance on bond markets and credit rating. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",bond market; corporate social responsibility disclosure; corporate social responsibility performance; credit ratings; credit spread,United Kingdom; corporate social responsibility; credit provision; financial market
Bank-lending channel of monetary policy transmission in WAEMU: An estimated DSGE model approach,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143312513&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2729&partnerID=40&md5=f257a2cc78ccc82c70dbc43c84aec080,"This article examines the effectiveness of the banking-lending channel in the transmission of monetary policy mechanisms in the West African Economic and Monetary Union. We estimated a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model with an incomplete credit market, where the financial system is based on an active banking sector and the central bank follows a fixed exchange rate regime, using quarterly data from 1985Q1 to 2020Q4. Findings reveal that, first, monetary policy induces an expansionary effect in the real economy when the banking sector loosens borrowing constraints. Second, we found that the banking sector is sensitive to the contraction of monetary policy via its effects on lending rates and deposit rates. Third, findings show that the bank-lending channel amplifies and propagates monetary policy transmission mechanisms into the real economy. The counterfactual analysis demonstrates that the level of financial depth within the currency union enhances the efficiency of the bank-lending channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The macroeconomic outcomes and the financial implications of monetary policy via bank-lending channels are more accentuated for the economies of the currency union with more financial depth than for those with shallow financial sector depth. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Bank-Lending channel; DSGE model; financial implications; macroeconomic outcomes; monetary policy transmission; WAEMU,West Africa; banking; general equilibrium analysis; macroeconomics; monetary policy; monetary union
Do stock market fluctuations lead to currency deflation in the South Asian region?

The symmetrical Panel based autoregressive distributed lag model (PARDL) model and panel-based non-linear autoregressive distributed lag model (NARDL) model with the Pooled Mean Group Approach (PMG) approach were employed to estimate the impact of stock market bullish and bearish behaviour on local currency variabilities of the South Asian region. The results show that during the pre-economic recession regime, negative fluctuations in stock indexes had a direct association with exchange rate fluctuations for a longer period. However, after the crisis, both negative and positive stock index shocks have formulated an indirect or inverse association with exchange rate fluctuations. These findings pose important practical implications for the short-term and long-term shareholders and financial analysts. Hence, it is recommended that shareholders and financial analysts should base their investment in South Asian stock indices on negative and positive shocks since the non-linear connectivity between both variables also exhibits regime dependence characteristics. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",asymmetric Granger causation; exchange rate and stock indexes; global financial crisis; panel ARDL; panel NARDL with PMG and MG; portfolio balanced approach,South Asia; currency; exchange rate; financial crisis; Granger causality test; numerical model; stock market

We used the Indian stock market as the testing grounds and applied panel regression and difference-in-differences to analyse 960 firm-year observations between 2010 and 2021. The first findings show that independent board directors and total board size are insignificant in CSR assurance engagement in a mandatory CSR policy period. However, CEO duality is less than likely causing CSR assurance engagement. The second findings show that CSR assurance engagement more than likely causes an increase in social performance disclosure before mandatory CSR policy implementation and increases social performance after policy implementation. The third findings show that the interactive effect of board characteristics (independent directors, total board size and CEO duality) and CSR assurance engagement causes an increase in social performance disclosure. The study sought clarity on the impact of CSR assurance and mandatory CSR reporting on information asymmetry problems to stakeholders.

Furthermore, it is unclear how developing economies such as Brazil can considerably improve environmental quality (EQ). This paper contributes to the ongoing literature by evaluating the effect of green finance, economic growth, political risk, social globalization and green innovation on environmental quality in Brazil. The study used data spanning between 2000Q1 and 2018Q4. Unlike other investigations, the current study used load capacity factor as a proxy for environmental quality, which considers both demand and supply sides of environmental issues. The current study applied the novel dynamic ARDL to capture the short and long-run nexus. The bootstrap causality test was also applied to capture causal connection instabilities over time. The results of this study are as follows: (1) a significant and positive association was found between political risk, green finance, green innovation and social globalization environmental quality; (2) a significant and negative interplay was detected between economic growth and environmental quality; (3) The time-varying causality shows a feedback causality at various periods between political risk, green finance, green innovation, economic growth, social globalization and environmental quality.

We embed the threshold variables of structural breaks and oil financialization into the VAR model of the dollar–oil relationship. Using daily data from 1983 to 2022, we find that a marked structural change in the dollar–oil relation exists in 2001 and that deepening oil financialization drives the structural change, making the portfolio effect the dominant effect of the dollar on oil prices. After 2001, the dollar negatively affects oil prices in both the long and short run. Furthermore, our threshold regression based on the investor self-adaptive expectation model shows that investor expectations significantly affect the dollar–oil relationship under oil financialization. A sharp increase in USD exchange rate volatility would strengthen investors' unilateral expectation of the trend of the USD exchange rate, which further enhances the portfolio effect, resulting in an even stronger negative effect of the dollar on oil prices. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",investor expectations; oil financialization; oil prices; structural change; US dollar exchange rate,commodity price; exchange rate; investment; oil trade; structural change

When exogenous uncertainty is mitigated, CVC-backed companies experience higher investment amounts than independent venture capital funds (IVC)-backed ones. The results evidence that follow-on investments motivate IVC-backed companies to exit via IPOs. At the same time, a prolonged duration for the organisational learning option leads CVC-backed companies to exit via acquisition.

This paper examines how the group composition, in terms of the mixture of kinship (Family) ties and social (Friends and Neighbours) ties among the borrowers, affects the default rates. Using binary logistics regression and three machine learning models, responses from 507 group micro-loan borrowers from four major Moroccan cities were analysed. The results show that the stronger the family and kinship ties are within a loan group, the higher is the default rate. On the contrary, the stronger the social ties are among the group, the lower is the default rate. Other key findings include that the diversion of fund usage from investment to consumption is not found to significantly cause default. Also, loan default can be a consequence of borrowers' strategic choice rather than financial distress. As compared to the female members, male borrowers are found to be causing higher default rates. Interestingly, the gender-related default rates are lower when more of the male borrowers are only socially related. Finally, group size is found to be positively associated with default. Our findings can help micro-finance institutions refine their lending policies and guidance on groups' composition and size to reduce default rates. © 2023 The Authors.

This implies that other than compensation and career concerns, insiders hoard bad news to fulfil their trading incentives. Our positive coefficients of insider sales also suggest that insider sellers can assess inside information promptly and anticipate shortly before the crashes.

In the euro area, the accumulation of economic imbalances caused by the loss of the automatic adjustment functions of the exchange rate have served as a structural background to limit its self-sustaining resilience during financial shocks. To enhance the stability of Optimal Currency Area (OCA) through the revitalization of those functions, this article argues that if the euro area had adopted some form of fiscal risk-sharing mechanisms, which could have generated a similar economic effect as if they had maintained a flexible F/X system as that which had existed in pre-euro days, the fiscal crisis hypothetically could have been more easily overcome within a shorter period with less financial support. The result suggests that if ‘Adjustment Fund for Foreign Exchange rate Loss (AFFEL)’, originally devised within these pages, had operated, the interest rates in crisis-hit members could have been significantly lower than actual levels during the crisis, while safely maintaining the euro system. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",adjustment fund for foreign exchange rate loss (AFFEL); euro; fiscal crisis; OCA; risk-sharing,Europe; exchange rate; financial crisis; fiscal policy; interest rate

A panel sample consisting of 4125 Spanish firms observed during years 2009–2014 has been analysed, using a treatment model. Robustness tests have also been used. The findings show the effects of output additionality of innovation funding support for small, medium and large firms, with a greater effect on large firms and a lower effect on medium firms. However, there has a weak effect for very large firms, which do not benefit in terms of output additionality. Since it is relatively easy for large firms to benefit from public support for innovation, some of the resources allocated to them should be passed on to small and medium firms. Medium firms seem to be less inclined to benefit from economies of scales than large firms and may be less affected by public innovation policy given the priority for small firms' development. Small and medium enterprises can benefit further from well-designed targeting programmes, with a prevalence of demand-side support measures compared to the supply-side measures. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",economic returns of innovation; firm size; output additionality; public funding support; Spain,Spain; economy of scale; finance; firm size; innovation
Model-based estimation in monetary policy inertia and it's another possibility,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146163947&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2770&partnerID=40&md5=d7c2d70db2c67e37170351158787f2d2,"In this paper, different monetary policy rules are re-estimated employing real-time data, known as Greenbook data, through MLE and Bayesian Estimation. The results favour the rule with persistent shocks and show that the inertial movement of the Federal funds rate is an illusion, as mentioned by Rudebusch (2002). Since it would be possible to have an omitted variable bias due to impure serial correlation, however, the rule with persistent shock could imply that the other serially correlated variable is required to explain the inertial movement of Federal funds rates. Based on this idea, serial correlation tests are implemented, showing the possibility of an omitted serial correlated variable. Therefore, it is reasonable to search for other persistent variables. As an illusion implies unpredictability in the movement of the Federal funds rate, this hypothesis could be against the credibility of the central bank. In order to have a reasonable explanation for the inertial movement other than persistent shocks, therefore, modifying the rule with a 3-month t-bill rate is re-estimated. The result shows that the rule with the t-bill rate outperformed in all aspects and is compatible with one theoretical explanation of minimizing the financial volatility for inertial movement. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Bayesian estimation; impure serial correlation; inertial movement; maximum likelihood estimation,Bayesian analysis; estimation method; financial market; financial system; maximum likelihood analysis; monetary policy; numerical model; policy implementation
Economic policy uncertainty nexus with the value relevance of advertising: Evidence from an emerging market,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147362443&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2789&partnerID=40&md5=1e5d47e45fa8a22a834e377b5125887b,"This paper aims to document the effect of economic policy uncertainty on the value of advertising expenditures within the context of an emerging market. The paper shows that the value of advertising expenditures is an increasing function of economic policy uncertainty. The impact of advertising on firm performance is more pronounced during the periods characterized by higher economic policy uncertainty. We argue that, during uncertain times, the financial information loses its relevance. Therefore, during these periods, non-financial traits, such as brand image, customer equity, relationship capital, and familiarity that characterizes firms with high advertising become more important. The findings hold in various sub-samples and across various proxies of advertising activity. The findings also hold under alternate estimation procedures (pooled OLS regression, panel data with fixed effects and instrument variable regression). More importantly, this paper also shows that, relative to other agency reducing mechanisms (such as analyst coverage, asset utilization ratio, expense ratio and dividend payments), advertising is more valuable during periods with high economic policy uncertainty. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",advertising; emerging markets; firm performance; information asymmetry; marketing; World Uncertainty Index,economic policy; financial market; financial system; marketing; numerical model; policy approach; uncertainty analysis
Macro-financial linkages in the high-frequency domain: Economic fundamentals and the Covid-induced uncertainty channel in US and UK financial markets,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145090821&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2748&partnerID=40&md5=e84b187d3b9c62c47b7798fbace8444f,"This article contributes to our understanding of the macro-financial linkages in the high-frequency domain during the recent health crisis. Building on the extant literature that mainly uses monthly or quarterly macro proxies, we examine the daily economic impact on intra-daily financial volatility by applying the macro-augmented HEAVY model with asymmetries and power transformations. Our study associates US and UK financial with macroeconomic uncertainties in addition to further macro drivers that exacerbate equity market volatility. Daily local economic policy uncertainty is one of the main drivers of financial volatility, alongside global credit and commodity factors. Higher macro uncertainty is found to increase the leverage and macro effects from credit and commodity markets on US and UK stock market realized volatility. Most interestingly, the Covid-19 outbreak is found to exert a considerable impact on financial volatilities through the uncertainty channel, given the prevalent worry about controversial policy interventions to support societies and markets, particularly in the case of the severely censured US and UK governments' reluctant and limited response in the very beginning of the pandemic. © 2022 The Authors.

Demographic efficiency drivers in the Chinese energy production chain: A hybrid neural multi-activity network data envelopment analysis,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145299890&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2765&partnerID=40&md5=6ab487bae3c8c5ba7d8d6c0d2272845d,"For meeting the external requirements of the Paris Agreement and reducing energy consumption per gross domestic product, China needs to improve its energy efficiency. Although the existing studies have attempted to investigate energy efficiency from different perspectives, little effort has yet been made to consider the collaboration among different stages in the production chain to produce energy outputs. In addition, various studies have also examined the determinants of energy efficiency, however, they mainly focused on technology and economic factors, no study has yet proposed and considered the influence of geographical factors on energy efficiency. In this article, we fill in the gap and make theoretical and empirical contributions to the literature. In this study, a two-stage analysis method is used to analyse energy efficiency and the influencing factors in China between 2009 and 2021. More specifically, from the theoretical/methodological perspective, a multi-activity network data envelopment analysis model is used to measure energy efficiency of different processes in the energy production chain. From the empirical perspective, we attempt to investigate the influence of geographical factors on energy efficiency through a neural network analysis. Meanwhile, the comparisons among different provinces are made. The result shows that the overall energy efficiency is low in China, and China relies more on the traditional energy industry than the clean energy industry. The efficiency level experiences a level of volatility over the examined period. Finally, we find that raw fuel pre-process and industry have a significant and positive impact on energy efficiency in China. © 2022 The Authors.

What type of central banker dampens the political business cycle?

Like previous studies, we find evidence of political cycles in our sample of 34 African countries for the period 1980–2018, but our findings show that politicians' ability to manipulate both fiscal and monetary policy depends on the degree of alliance between the fiscal authority and the monetary authority. Indeed, our analysis reveals that the political business cycle worsens when the central banker is an ally whereas a non-ally central banker is associated with a decrease in the ability of the incumbent government to induce opportunistic political cycles, and this result holds, regardless of whether an African country is classified as a democracy or a dictatorship. In addition to that, despite the theoretical argument that political business cycles are unlikely to exist in dictatorships, we find evidence that both political budget and monetary cycles are prevalent in African dictatorships. © 2023 The Authors.

The impact of justified corporate governance changes against exchange rate exposure in North Cyprus,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146083541&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2749&partnerID=40&md5=4ea56f40550f4293a21cc84feaff1f57,"This study seeks to use the legally required governance reforms of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Financial Reporting Council 2012–2018 and the EU COM 2012–2014 to investigate the relationship between corporate governance performance, exchange rate exposure and hedging by using two governance indexes based on a more comprehensive model previously constructed. The paper is one of the first to adopt the measures that state the importance of internal (corporate culture) and external (corporate legality) governance qualities that help prevent exchange rate exposure and improve trade and hedging. The examination is conducted by using the ARCH and ARMA models as well as a two-factor and a multiple-factor model to capture the variations that significantly account for variations in the exchange rate exposure, net trade, and stock market returns. Empirical results revealed that an improvement in corporate governance indexes is associated with a greater reduction in exchange rate exposure, an increase in net trade, and more hedging at the firm level. In addition, adoption of the corporate legality measures has a greater impact on exchange rate exposure and hedging than corporate culture measures. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",ARMA; corporate culture; corporate governance; corporate legality; foreign exchange exposure,Cyprus; corporate strategy; empirical analysis; exchange rate

By focusing on critical dimensions of the national logistics performance, we find that financial crises have a negative impact on logistics-supported infrastructure, market size, education and training, technological readiness, and innovation. This impact is more pronounced in low-income countries and in election years, whilst it weakens in the presence of majority governments and when right-wing governments stay in office. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",emerging and developing countries; financial crisis; national logistics performance; political environment; system GMM; types of financial crises,banking; currency; debt crisis; developing world; financial crisis; logistics
Oil price uncertainty and the relation to tanker shipping,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147558389&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2792&partnerID=40&md5=4022522b07efed8bac3ac9a9b0c65979,"This article investigates whether time variation in the returns' co-movement of oil and Baltic Dirty Tanker Index can be linked to oil market uncertainty. We measure uncertainty using a battery of different proxies considering both parametric and non-parametric methods and study its role from both statistical and economic perspectives. Using a regression framework combined with regime switching analysis, we show that oil price uncertainty and the future correlation of oil and dirty-tanker returns are negatively associated. This negative association is more pronounced in highly volatile periods. The identified regimes are directly linked to high-low crude oil volatility periods with implications on the level of correlation they exhibit to oil returns. Results are robust across crudes and volatility measures. Additional robustness checks corroborate that results hold for individual dirty-tanker routes and clean-tanker cargoes. © 2023 The Authors.

The impact of CEOs' early-life experience on the financialization of non-financial firms: Evidence from the great Chinese famine,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145073248&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2755&partnerID=40&md5=75fad40d59bfff0bf4f7d995947a0670,"This study investigates whether CEOs' early adverse experience could explain cross-sectional heterogeneity in the financialization of non-financial firms. We utilize whether the CEO lived through the Great Chinese Famine as a proxy for the adverse experience. We find that non-financial firms led by CEOs with such experience are significantly less likely to be involved in financialized activities than those led by CEOs without such experience. Experienced CEOs are prone to develop conservative preference for the short-term financial assets over long-term ones. The famine effect is more pronounced in enterprises with less competitive industries, less ownership of controlling shareholders, and non-Big 4 audit firms. Furthermore, channel tests demonstrate that the famine experience reduces CEO overconfidence and lowers the agency cost of their firms, resulting in a lower financialization level. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",agency cost; CEO overconfidence; early-life experience; financialization; great Chinese famine,cost analysis; finance; heterogeneity; industrial enterprise

It also examines the role of fiscal policy in conjunction with the performance of financial development during both normal and stress times. The data consists of a panel of 26 European Union countries over the period 1990–2020. The results show that during normal times, the finance-led growth relationship and the stock market are greatly important, while during stress times the relationship becomes insignificant. Interestingly, financial institutions are found to be more effective at promoting growth and there is clear evidence that a potentially dynamic positive effect of institutions to growth is absorbed by macroeconomic shocks. In addition, there is evidence for a threshold at a lower level compared to those previously identified in the literature. This latter finding can be attributed to different measures of financial institutions used and the impact of macroeconomic shocks. The inability of both financial sectors to enhance economic activity seems to exhibit persistence from the occurrence of the global financial crisis until the onset of the recent Covid-19 pandemic. © 2023 The Authors.

Using a structural VAR model, I identify supply and demand shocks in global crude oil markets and estimate changes in their effects on the US industrial production. The key finding is that the US industry output has become more responsive to oil price shocks since the shale oil boom. Oil supply shocks have been more important and heterogeneous effects on the industrial production depending on the US or non-US oil supply component. There has also emerged the positive effect of oil demand shocks, stimulating aggregate economic activity. In particular, I find that there have been strong positive spillover effects from an oil price increase to other industries not only through direct purchases of inputs for oil production and investment, but also through indirect knowledge and technology transfers created during the shale revolution. These findings have profound policy implications for the fiscal and monetary authority who copes with exogenous oil shocks. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",oil shocks; shale oil boom; spillovers; structural change; structural VAR; US industrial production,United States; demand analysis; industrial production; oil production; shale gas; spillover effect; structural change; supply chain management
Cascading bankruptcies under simultaneous sectorial shocks: Theory and application to the Tunisian banking sector,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145317367&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2750&partnerID=40&md5=fd10011472e14c56cfba5e3fe6b75b6a,"This paper proposes a theoretical framework modelling the effect of simultaneous sectorial shocks on the banking system resilience, in presence of overlapping portfolio risk. A sectorial shock decreases the value of banks' assets and solvency. We show that beyond a determined threshold, the regulator (central bank) shall intervene in order to avoid that simultaneous sectorial shocks lead to bankruptcies in a cascading process. The model is simulated in the context of the Tunisian banking system for a variety of extreme macroeconomic conditions (economic recession and inflation). The simulations show that the simultaneous shocks to industry, commerce and real estate sectors might lead to the bankruptcies of one to 10 banks among the 23 Tunisian banks via the cascading contagion channel, in the absence of a prompt and adequate intervention by the regulator. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",banking network; bankruptcy; portfolio risk; sectorial shocks; systemic banking risk; Tunisia,Tunisia; banking; bankruptcy; financial crisis; financial market; macroeconomics; regulatory approach
Market efficiency of the cryptocurrencies: Some new evidence based on price–volume relationship,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144265557&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2744&partnerID=40&md5=b383f245a4de41ccb02fa8b6d7affc36,"Cryptocurrencies have emerged as an important investment avenue in the past few years. Investors are increasingly interested in these currencies amid surging financial returns. In this context, understanding market efficiency of cryptocurrency has become very crucial for investors and academicians. The price–volume framework is a popular approach in financial economics to understand the market efficiency of stocks in the stock markets. Therefore, this article examines the market efficiency of cryptocurrencies through price–volume framework to understand whether crypto market is predictable. Towards this objective, data on both return and trading volume (TV) of the top eight cryptocurrencies are used for the period 8 August 2015–20 October 2022. As an empirical method, both linear and non-linear causality models are used to validate the hypothesis. Our results confirm that TV cannot predict the cryptocurrencies' return, thereby validating the market efficiency hypothesis. Furthermore, we divide the sample according to the structural break period. The result from the post-break period analysis also confirms the presence of market efficiency in the recent period for all currencies, barring XRP, XMR and DASH. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",cryptocurrencies; efficient market hypothesis; non-linear causality; structural break,currency; investment; market system; nonlinearity; price dynamics; stock market

The results suggest several equifinal paths to corporate educational (mis)match. The findings reveal the need for a more hybridised coexistence between tertiary education and training activities, which can emerge from the cooperation of local actors (education/training institutions and businesses together). Tertiary education, training programmes focused on advanced IT skills, and collaborating with local knowledge providers can reinforce the effect; indeed, their presence (singly or in combination) intensifying the achievement of high levels of educational match. In the absence of these conditions (singly or in combination), a broad training programme can act as a counterbalance and vice versa. Policymakers should put in place tools to enable more inclusive access to collaborations between local businesses and knowledge providers, promoting an upgrade of educational programmes to develop shop-floor workers who are more digitally aware, and better prepared to successfully undertake non-routine cognitive tasks. This would foster the self-sustainability and flourishing of advanced manufacturing in high-income countries. © 2023 The Authors.

This result suggests that the professional knowledge and monitoring experience gained by institutional cross-owners lead them to increase firm productivity. This positive effect is less pronounced in highly competitive product markets. The results also showed that corporate social responsibility is a channel that allows institutional cross-owners, particularly pressure insensitive cross-owners, to influence firm productivity. This result suggests that institutional cross-owners drive corporate social responsibility investments leading to enhanced firm productivity. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",corporate social responsibility; cross-owners; firm productivity; institutional investors; pressure insensitive; pressure sensitive,France; corporate social responsibility; firm ownership; investment; productivity

Can digital M&A reduce the stock price crash risk?,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193519003&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2997&partnerID=40&md5=b4134b31ed15f99b58b7ecbccb46fd1e,"With the rapid development of the digital economy, digital mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have become essential means for enterprises to acquire digital technologies and accelerate their digital transformation. This paper examines the impact of digital M&A on stock price crash risk using a sample of M&A transactions of China A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2021. The results show that digital M&A can reduce stock price crash risk after M&A. Further discussions reveal that compared to non-digital M&A, digital M&A has a better market effect, and the target firms of digital M&A generally are in different industries from the acquirers, have relatively low registered capital, have a shorter registration time, and have better financial performance. Mechanism tests indicate that during the transaction, digital M&A increases the probability of signing earnout contracts and reduces the cash payment ratio. After the transaction, digital M&A increases research and development (R&D) investment and improves R&D investment efficiency, ultimately reducing stock price crash risk. Cross-sectional tests suggest that in situations with intense market competition, lower digitalization level of the acquirers, and higher business similarity between the acquirer and the target firm, digital M&A is more effective in reducing stock price crash risk. The findings enrich the research on the operational mechanisms and economic consequences of digital M&A, providing theoretical references for regulatory authorities to optimise M&A regulatory policies and for enterprises to assess the benefits and risks of digital M&A. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",digitalization; economic consequences; influence mechanism; mergers and acquisitions; research and development investment; stock price crash risk,

The analysis spans from 1 January 2002, to 30 June 2023. Our findings reveal that the total connectedness index (TCI) changed over time, indicating sensitivity to time-specific developments and major events during different periods. The TCI is influenced more by extreme positive or negative shocks, as the lower and upper quantile TCIs are higher compared to the medium quantile TCI. Furthermore, the short-term TCIs exhibit higher values than the medium- and long-term TCIs. These variations imply that the TCI is influenced by different types of shocks or mechanisms across different quantiles. Specifically, the short-term TCIs are driven by global economic policy uncertainty, real global economic activity, and the geopolitical risk index (GPR).

Using data from non-financial companies in the United States from 1971 to 2021, we argue that the short-term debt may reduce the information asymmetries and discipline the management decisions, thus improving the investment efficiency. We argue, however, that the relationship varies throughout different life cycle stages. We find that short-term debt positively influences investment efficiency and over-investment. Furthermore, the firm's life cycle significantly impacts investment efficiency, with the introduction and growth stages negatively associated with it. The life cycle also affects the relationship between short-term debt and investment efficiency, particularly during the growth stage. These results emphasis the role of short-term debt and the firm's life cycle in mitigating information asymmetries and shaping management behaviour. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",financing decision; firm's life cycle; information asymmetries; investment decision; investment efficiency; short-term debt,

Do ESG funds engage in portfolio pumping to gain higher flows? An application of Benford's Law,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190541844&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2976&partnerID=40&md5=9e9086cacd20ac6b0d9d5a6926c904af,"Portfolio pumping is identified as an ‘illegal’ trading practice that involves inflating quarter- and year-end portfolio returns. Utilizing U.S. domestic equity mutual fund daily return data, we examine whether environmental, social, and governance (ESG) funds engage in portfolio pumping to generate higher flows. Our findings reveal that, on average, ESG funds attract 0.4% higher flows than other funds. However, they engage in portfolio pumping and achieve returns that are 5.3 basis points (bps) higher at quarter ends compared to their returns during the rest of the year. This practice does not result in additional fund flows. Notably, compared to other funds, ESG funds exhibit a significant 4 bps reduction through portfolio pumping. This implies that, on the last day of the quarter, ESG funds earn approximately 4 bps lower returns compared to other funds. Portfolio pumping is costly for both investors and financial markets since it leads to trading activities that cause stock prices to deviate from their fundamental values. ESG funds engage less in portfolio pumping than other funds, which indicates that their primary focus is to maximize fund flows rather than enhance or create a positive social impact on the underlying firm portfolio. Investors seem to understand this goal, particularly when ESG funds engage in portfolio pumping and avoid investing in ESG funds. © 2024 The Authors.

Using the system generalised method of moments and based on a sample of 322 banks across 18 countries during the period 2006–2020, we find that a higher level of subordinated debt leads banks to avoid moral-hazard behaviours and engage in risk shifting when adapting to a tighter macroprudential framework, which in turn leads to a greater effectiveness of these policies. Furthermore, as robustness tests, we show that this effect is stronger in advanced economies and in the United States of America.

The model considers a firm's IPO, secondary-market trading and subsequent investment decision. We analyse the conditions under which underinvestment can paradoxically be advantageous despite reducing the fundamental value of the firm. The benefit of committing to underinvest post-IPO is expressed in reduced underpricing and thus a higher valuation during the IPO. We furthermore show that the firm may commit to an inefficient investment policy by appointing a manager with biased expectations or risk aversion. Our findings imply that, under certain conditions, firms are better off relying on biased managers when their initial outlook is poor, but risk-averse managers when their initial outlook is good. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",biased expectations; inefficient investment; IPO; risk aversion; underinvestment; underpricing,

To ensure the robustness of our findings, we employ multiple analytical approaches to address potential endogeneity and selection biases. Our evidence demonstrates that the link between ESG and TFP link becomes more pronounced during economic slowdowns, particularly in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Furthermore, our investigation reveals that firms' environmental performance plays a pivotal role in driving this relationship. To validate this outcome, we employ a quasi-natural experiment, focused on the adoption of the international climate change treaty, the 2015 ‘Paris Agreement’.

Climate risks and the REITs market,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191711136&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2983&partnerID=40&md5=6216cad1e35ddecf86fbbc40d54232a6,"This study presents results supporting the need to price climate risks in real estate investment trusts. We approach this objective by conducting some empirical analyses for global, regional, and [US] sectoral REITs for want of wider coverage while we also consider variants of climate risks involving physical and transition risks. We first establish that climate concerns amplify the volatility of REIT returns. While our results are split for sectoral REITs, we find that both physical and transition risks magnify the volatility in the regional and global REITs market. However, when we consider the US sectoral REITs, we find contrasting evidence between the two variants of climate risks. While the transition risks seem to raise the REITs market volatility, perhaps owing to improved trading in the market as signalled by some level commitments towards addressing climate change, the physical risks associated with damages due to climate change tend to lower the REITs market volatility due to lower trading. Consequently, we formulate a framework that enables a profit-maximizing investor to observe climate risks when making investment decisions in the REITs market, and we further show that doing so provides higher economic gains than ignoring it. This outcome has implications for investors looking for the best hedging strategy against climate-related risks, especially as the world intensifies efforts towards de-carbonization. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",climate risks; forecast evaluation; hedging; predictability analysis; REITs; volatility,

This means that our model has a higher default risk identification ability than the traditional one. And the META-SAMPLER method of processing imbalanced data is also promising. Moreover, we found the machine learning designed in this paper has a higher ability to identify farmers' loan default than the traditional econometric methods.

The main finding highlights that inflation has an asymmetrical impact on inequality in the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) region, diminishing income disparities among the wealthy while exacerbating them among the impoverished. The results are sensitive to the economic characteristics of the country as well as the level of income brackets. Education, health expenditures, size of agriculture, economic development and control of corruption play pivotal roles in modelling the relationship between inflation and income inequality in the SSA region.

Multi-class financial distress prediction based on stacking ensemble method,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198722259&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.3020&partnerID=40&md5=d63b4cc5deff704e81496ac22f289596,"The motivation of this article is to help financial soundness companies understand their specific financial status so that they can take timely measures to avoid financial distress. Existing multi-class financial distress prediction (FDP) studies have mainly segmented financial crisis status, with less attention paid to financial soundness companies. To fill this gap, we propose a new multi-class definition of FDP from the perspective of financial soundness enterprises. The financial states are defined as financial soundness, moderate financial soundness, mild financial soundness and financial distress. We propose a stacking ensemble model for multi-class FDP. First, deep neural network, multinomial logit regression (MNLogit) and multivariate discriminant analysis models are used as basic classifiers to obtain preliminary prediction results. Second, MNLogit is used to integrate the results from the previous step. To increase the effective information, stock information is then added into the model. The proposed model was trained using data from 2007 to 2019 for Chinese listed companies and tested using data from 2020. The results show that the MacroR-Pre, MacroR-Rec, MacroR-F1 and MacroR-AUC of the proposed model are better compared with the benchmark model, including individuals and ensembles, with 87.05%, 90.68%, 88.70% and 88.20%.The addition of stock information and non-financial indicators can improve the accuracy of the multi-class FDP model by about 8%. The innovativeness of this paper is twofold. First, it proposes a new multi-class definition of enterprise financial status. Second, a multi-class FDP based on stacking is constructed, which provides a new method for solving the multi-class FDP problem. The study shows that the proposed multi-class definition and stacking model are suitable for analysing financial soundness enterprises, which can help managers effectively grasp the specific financial status and have strong practical significance. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",deep neural network; financial distress prediction; financial network indicators; financial status; multi-class prediction; stacking ensemble,

Data from 31 countries (a mix of developed and emerging) collected between May 2020 and May 2021 are analyzed using a multilevel Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) model. The results reveal that firms that were operational, larger in size, received financial incentives, and arranged remote work for their workforce laid off a smaller proportion of workers. Conversely, firms that experienced significant sales reductions, input supply disruptions, and introduced delivery or carry-out services laid off a larger proportion of workers. Moreover, among financial incentive-recipient firms, smaller ones and those that introduced remote work and delivery or carry-out services had smaller layoffs. At the country level, the human capital index (HCI) significantly influenced job-cut decisions, with higher HCI scores associated with smaller layoffs. Classifying countries into “developed” and “emerging” yielded similar results, except for temporary closure having no significant impact on job cuts in developed countries and remote work showing no impact on job cuts in emerging countries. The robustness of the results was confirmed by a multilevel zero-inflated Tobit model, which consistently reproduced the outcomes. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",closure; country-level factors; COVID-19; demand and supply; firm-level factors; job cut,

Our findings reveal that: (1) The NEDC initiative significantly enhances firm-level TFP. This result remains robust after addressing endogeneity issues through IV-2SLS and propensity score matching and difference in differences methods and undergoing a series of robustness tests. (2) Channels tests indicate that the NEDC policy indirectly boosts firm TFP primarily by fostering technological innovation and augmenting human capital. (3) Heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that the NEDC policy effectively stimulates TFP growth in state-owned enterprises, firms with high equity concentration, manufacturing and low-tech industry firms. The policy's impact is more pronounced in cities with high administrative levels, in the eastern and central cities, and in cities with superior traditional infrastructure. The empirical evidence provided by this study not only supports the role of e-commerce infrastructure in driving economic growth but also offers valuable insights for bridging the income disparity between developing and developed nations, and mitigating income inequality. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",e-commerce infrastructure; human capital; technological innovation; total factor productivity,

Built upon a multivariate DCC-GJRGARCH model and the spillover index method, the results highlight a high dynamic conditional correlation between margin buying activity and stock market trading which shows apparent time-varying features. Furthermore, there is a two-way risk-spillover relationship, with stock market trading playing a dominant role in risk transmission. More importantly, the level of risk contagion actually varies over time due to certain large external shocks. Margin buying activity tends to be a mean risk-spillover receiver most time, whereas it acts as both a volatility risk-spillover transmitter and a receiver over the entire sample period. The analysis thus implies that margin buying activity does have a close interrelationship with stock market trading in China, which has important implications for both regulators and investors. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",China; dynamic conditional correlation; margin buying; risk transmission; spillover effect; stock market trading,

The same effect emerges when we consider the communication's tone. Furthermore, we construct a macroprudential decision communication index and show that the negative impact of the BoE's tone is significant only when the decision communication index value is above average. Moreover, we find evidence that negative abnormal returns tend to appear after the Brexit referendum, while we find positive abnormal returns before that date.

To achieve this, the study utilizes monthly data from July 2003 to December 2020 on oil prices and macroeconomic uncertainty, examining their impact on Pakistan's exports to its major trading partners. To ensure detailed and robust findings, the study employs various advanced econometric tools, including quantile unit root, cointegration, Granger causality tests, and quantile-on-quantile regression (QQR) and wavelet quantile correlation (WQC) techniques. The QQR and WQC estimates reveal diverse and nonlinear effects of oil price shocks and macroeconomic uncertainty on exports, reflecting the complexity of the relationship. While oil price shocks (OP) predominantly hinder exports in most cases, a significant and positive association between OP and exports is also observed. Similarly, macroeconomic uncertainty generally exhibits a significantly adverse influence on exports, but positive impacts are also evident. Furthermore, the quantile Granger causality test confirms the presence of a bidirectional causal relationship between the selected series. Based on the results mentioned above, the study argues that the effects of oil price shocks and economic uncertainty are nonlinear, diverse, and complex. As a result, the study suggests implementing phase-wise policy recommendations to address these complexities. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",advanced methods; exports; macroeconomic uncertainty; oil price shocks; Pakistan; wavelet quantile correlation,

Political power differential and forced CEO turnover: Evidence from Chinese non-state-owned enterprises,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190479757&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2978&partnerID=40&md5=9a4de60cf7a2332679e81d790561e265,"In China, the prevalence of strong political connections among a significant number of boards of directors and CEOs highlights the importance of cultivating such relationships. This is particularly relevant when considering the Chinese political system where officers holding higher political ranks wield dominant, or even absolute, power in decision-making. Our findings reveal that the political power differential (PPD) between a board of directors and its CEO plays a pivotal role in mitigating CEO entrenchment associated with political power. Specifically, when directors possess more political power than their CEOs, they can effectively fulfil their disciplinary role, leading to the dismissal of underperforming CEOs. Our study substantiates a significantly positive relationship between PPD and the probability of a forced CEO turnover, as well as the sensitivity of CEO turnover to performance. Notably, as PPD increases by one standard deviation from its mean level, we observe an approximate 30% increase in CEO turnover-performance sensitivity. These findings confirm a higher likelihood of replacing underperforming CEOs in firms with a politically powerful board. Our results also highlight that a higher proportion of either independent or female directors alone does not guarantee effective monitoring. The key lies in ensuring that these directors possess stronger political power than the CEO. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",China; forced CEO turnover; political power differential; turnover performance sensitivity,
Bilateral investment treaties and sovereign default risk: Evidence for emerging markets,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192388529&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2984&partnerID=40&md5=a0652fcab420e82c1afc3bfb5e38a190,"This paper analyses the impact of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) on sovereign default risk using monthly data for 29 emerging markets from 1996 to 2016. Under a BIT, foreign investors can use an international arbitration scheme to enforce compensation claims against the host country's government. We focus on the so far unexplored legal risk associated with BITs since a higher likelihood of government expropriations implicitly increases public debt. We do not find a significant unconditional effect of BITs on sovereign default risk (measured by the month-over-month percentage change in a country's Emerging Market Bond Index). Considering the heterogeneity of BITs and political risk, we find robust and strong negative effects of BITs on sovereign bond returns. In countries with high political risk of expropriation (measured by low executive constraints), we find that the implementation of BITs with strong investor protection is associated with a significantly negative impact on sovereign bond returns (−0.45 percentage points), which compares to roughly 11.7% of bond returns' monthly standard deviation. © 2024 The Authors.

Market supervisor monetary penalties for non-compliance with informational requirements: Do investors care?,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193053035&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2988&partnerID=40&md5=1edd01d6e964d1b8628673061b3dd0db,"This study measures and differentiates investors' responses to market supervisors' monetary penalties for non-compliance with informational requirements for the capital market in Poland, broken down by the type of distorted information and the form of a breach. An event study was conducted to measure the information content of monetary penalties. We used a market model and tested the significance of abnormal daily returns using both parametric and non-parametric tests. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted to measure the determinants of market reactions. We employed two novel classifications of non-compliance: by the type of distorted information (financial reporting information and other information) and by the form of a breach (failing to provide information and providing erroneous information). We contribute to the literature by finding that investors react negatively to monetary penalties imposed on companies for non-compliance with financial reporting information requirements, whereas they do not react to such penalties for non-compliance with other information requirements. We incorporate original variables that explain the magnitude of the market reaction and find that (i) the longer the distance between the breach and penalty imposition, the weaker the market reaction, and (ii) the greater the monetary penalty, the stronger the market reaction. We also find that both forms of breach lead to similar negative market reactions. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",breach of informational requirements; capital market supervision; enforcement actions; financial information; governance; monetary penalties; non-financial information,
"Commodity price volatility, institutions and economic growth: An empirical investigation",2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193547003&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2996&partnerID=40&md5=89596081e1c34983e4f6bb7a42a0bdff,"This article investigates the role of institutional quality in transmitting effects of commodity price volatility to economic growth. To do so, we collect data on 107 primary commodity exporting countries in both developing and developed ones over the period 1976–2015. Our empirical approach is based on Solow growth model framework (Solow, R. M. (1956). The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 70(1), 65) and consists of estimating a dynamic panel model using the two-step system GMM estimator. Our results show evidence that commodity price booms are associated with good economic performances that are unfortunately wiped out by the negative effects of price volatility in developing commodity-dependent countries (CDCs). The main channel through which this volatility affects economic growth turns out to be through factor productivity. Finally, we have formally established that the negative effect of price volatility in CDCs is mainly due to the poor quality of institutions in these countries. These results suggest that it is important for commodity-exporting economies, especially developing CDCs, to work on building strong economic and political institutions to guard against the risk of commodity price volatility. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",commodity price; developing countries; economic growth; institutions; resource abundance; two-step GMM; volatility,
Do creditors care about greening in corporations?

Based on a sample of 38,127 firm-year observations of non-financial firms operating worldwide between 2004 and 2019, our evidence indicates that eco-friendly practices have no significant direct effect on the cost of debt. Thus, we consider other theoretically expected channels that moderate this link. Notably, profitability and board gender diversity significantly moderate the relationship between eco-friendly practices and the cost of debt. Further investigation reveals interesting associations between low and high governance systems, low and high financial development environments, code law versus common law systems, and polluting versus non-polluting sectors. We suggest theoretical and practical implications by which firms can reap greater benefits from environmental engagement. © 2024 The Authors.

In contrast, cross-border acquirers and their rivals experience negative but insignificant returns, while targets and their rivals record gains, regardless whether it is a domestic or cross-border transaction. Further analyses reveal that domestic acquirers obtaining larger relative increases in their market share benefit the most, indicating that market power considerations are the primary driver behind acquirers' positive returns.

Forecasting reserve risk for temporal dependent losses in insurance,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197274017&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.3014&partnerID=40&md5=560ce0bd167093aade7590f0cd1af328,"In non-life insurance, insurance companies aim to accurately assess their reserves in order to fulfil their future obligations. They are based on methods provided by the literature review to evaluate their reserve risk. However, these methods do not take all claim characteristics and ignore the temporal dependence structure of claims, which can affect reserve amounts and lead to delayed payments for policyholders. Therefore, the aim is to investigate the temporal dependence structure among claim amounts (losses) in order to evaluate the accurate amounts of reserves. To achieve this goal, a model called the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Sinistrality Model is proposed, which considers the temporal dependence characteristics of claims. This model is used to estimate model parameters, so the consistency of such an estimate is proven. Additionally, a bootstrap method adjusted to the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Sinistrality model is proposed for predicting reserves and errors. The results reveal that considering temporal dependence between losses improves reserve distribution estimation and enhances solvency capital requirement. This means that insurance companies will be able to ensure they have sufficient funds available to meet their obligations to policyholders, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and trust. Additionally, this can assist insurance companies in maintaining better regulatory compliance. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",bootstrap; claims reserving; generalized autoregressive conditional sinistrality model; prediction errors; solvency capital requirement; temporal dependence,

Our focus is on acquiring firms listed in six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Employing a panel data approach to explore these interrelationships, our findings suggest that acquiring companies involved in cross-border deals tend to resort to accruals earnings management before the acquisition rather than real earnings management. Conversely, acquiring firms engaged in unrelated industrial deals are inclined to employ real earnings management over accruals earnings management. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the extent of acquired ownership acts as an effective tool in mitigating both forms of earnings management. Similarly, cash payment acquisitions emerge as an efficient means of curtailing both accruals and real earnings management. These results underscore that the engagement of GCC acquiring firms in earnings management is influenced by the specific characteristics inherent in the acquisition deals. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",accrual earnings management; acquisition deal characteristics; GCC; real earnings management,

In the paper at hand, effects on sovereign bond risk premia stemming from macroeconomic, fiscal, and volatility factors, are examined by considering the classification of sovereign riskiness. Panel data estimation techniques are used, for 30 countries, with data in quarterly frequency for the period 2001Q1 to 2019Q4. Sovereign spreads are found to be subject to heterogeneous effects associated with their credit ratings; spreads on sovereign bonds considered low-risk increase with higher growth rates and inflation, while spreads on highly risky bonds decrease with higher growth rates and are more sensitive to idiosyncratic and global volatility. Primary fiscal surpluses indeed lower spreads but cannot counterbalance the effects of volatility episodes and the prospects for low growth. Our results provide support for countercyclical fiscal policies, suggesting that spreads can be expected to be reduced by primary surpluses, under the condition that the economy expands and market volatility is low. Our main findings are robust to various alternative setups, samples, and control variables such as central banks' asset purchases. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",credit ratings; economic growth; fiscal policy; heterogeneity; sovereign risk; volatility,

The empirical results show that EPU significantly increases the credit risk of MFIs. Our findings are valid in a series of robustness checks. The moderating effects reveal that group lending can mitigate the impact of EPU on the credit risk of MFIs and that EPU has a weaker impact on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and cooperatives and credit unions (Coop/CUs). We explore potential channels through which credit risk is influenced by EPU from the perspectives of earnings volatility and cost. We find that EPU increases the credit risk of MFIs not only by reducing profitability and leverage levels and increasing earnings volatility but also by raising financing costs. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",credit risk; earnings volatility; economic policy uncertainty; financing costs; group lending; microfinance institutions,

Using causality tests and a rolling window detrended cross-correlation coefficient, the study reveals several key findings. First, the causal effect of investor sentiment on sectoral returns varies over time, with each sector responding differently. Second, while no evidence of dependence exists for time scales less than 2 months, a positive relationship emerges for time scales greater than 6 months, except for the utilities sector, which is found to be negative. Third, the study shows that the relationships between all pairs of variables are time-dependent. Finally, economic news sentiment might have a varying impact on market inefficiency over different periods, making it challenging to predict market behaviour based on sentiment data. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Covid-19; efficiency; investor sentiment; rolling window; S&P 500 sectoral indices; time-varying causality,

In the literature on sustainable investing, most studies have focused on developed markets, and there are relatively few studies that have concentrated on emerging markets. To fill this research gap, we study sustainable investing in emerging markets, by examining the comparative performance of the sustainability indices in the partner exchanges of the Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) initiative from emerging markets. In particular, we investigate three key issues that are of concern to most investors: (i) can the investment strategy of investing together in the themes of sustainability and emerging markets outperform the global sustainability benchmark? (ii) can this strategy outperform the global benchmark for emerging markets? (iii) can it improve portfolio diversification? Overall, our time series analysis and Monte Carlo simulation reveal the heterogeneity in sustainable investment performance across the world, and suggest the potential of obtaining superior risk-adjusted returns in certain regions while benefiting from portfolio diversification. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",emerging markets; portfolio management; sustainable investing,

Bayesian regression results show that financial stability positively affects sustainable development in both groups of countries with a low probability of impact. This probability is above 79.3% in developed countries and above 81.5% in developing ones. When considering the role of monetary policy, the direction of impact and probability is different. Specifically, financial stability in the environment of high inflation and increased money supply (ZscoreInf and ZscoreM2) negatively affects sustainable development in both country groups with high probabilities. In contrast, when considering the monetary policy with the foreign exchange reserves tool (ZscoreER), financial stability positively impacts sustainable development with the probability of 89.6% in developed countries and 92.5% in developing one. When considering the role of fiscal policy, financial stability with government spending (ZscoreGE) positively affects sustainable development with a probability of over 99.7% in the two groups of countries. Meanwhile, tax income in a financially stable environment increases the probability of a positive effect at 100% in developed countries, and a negative effect with a probability of 60.9% in developing countries. From the above results, we propose that central banks in both developed and developing countries should aim to stabilize prices and aim to maintain a low inflation rate to help limit shocks to sudden interest rate changes that cause market volatility. This is a premise to help stabilize finance and promote sustainable development. Furthermore, these countries should maintain an adequate foreign exchange reserve to withstand external shocks and ensure they have enough foreign currency to meet macroeconomic needs, which can boost confidence. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Bayesian regression; developed and developing countries; financial stability; fiscal policy; monetary policy; sustainable development,

China's Treasury bond futures contract embeds a quality option, rolling timing option, and month end timing option, and these options restrict each other, making the pricing of Treasury bond futures extremely difficult. Quality option plays a dominant role in these three options. This article creatively divides quality options into theoretical quality option caused by the definition deviation of conversion factor and disturbance quality option caused by the market factors except for interest rate. Using the bond valuation method based on the yield to maturity curve, this article puts forward the embedded theoretical quality option and China's Treasury bond futures pricing models. For the empirical test, the dataset covers a 10-year Treasury bond futures contract in 151 working days. The results show that the relative error between our model and the actual closing price of the Treasury bond futures is small compared with the cost of carry model, which excludes any embedded options.

Export activities of G20 economies are scrutinized empirically, with which sizeable differences are observed between figures in the proposed residence-based domestic value-added trade measure and the conventional domestic value-added trade measure. This calls for new measures, to which the present study responds. It has been demonstrated that the developed G20 gains persistently in residence-based domestic value-added exports, increasing from the conventional domestic value-added exports measure. Whereas trade performance of the developing G20 deteriorates with considerably reduced surpluses in the new measure. Considerable additional value flows out from developing to developed economies in GVCs. Developed economies continue to gain from international trade as a matter of fact. © 2024 The Authors.

Using a panel data from 48 countries from 2000 to 2019, this paper aims to examine the impact of financial sanctions on the volatility of cross-border capital flows. We employ difference-in-differences (DID) and spatial DID (SDID) models, showing the result that financial sanctions lead to an exacerbation of the volatility of cross-border capital inflows and outflows in the targeted country, with the channel of negative impact on the financial sector in the targeted country. The subsample regressions indicate heterogeneous impacts of financial sanctions depending on economic structure and capital account openness. Additionally, the result of the SDID model shows that financial sanctions cause cross-border transmission of financial risks, and that the spatial spillover effect of financial sanctions will also have negative economic impacts on other countries in addition to the target country. The significance of this study lies in emphasizing that international financial sanctions affect the economy of target countries through cross-border capital flows. Meanwhile, we confirm that financial sanctions pose a certain threat to global financial stability. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",cross-border capital flows; difference-in-difference model; economic channel; financial sanctions; risk contagion; spillover effect,

ESG subcategory analysis shows that the governance peer effect has the most obvious alleviating effect on financial distress. The negative impact of ESG peer effects on corporate financial distress is stronger when firms have high network power, network cohesion and network control in executive social networks.

Specifically, the study seeks to evaluate the influence of IT on macroeconomic performance during the global financial crisis (GFC) and the COVID-19 pandemic periods separately. The empirical analysis comprises three approaches: propensity score matching, difference-in-differences, and panel-corrected standard error methods. The empirical investigation reveals that IT significantly impacts inflation and its volatility during the GFC. In contrast, the effect on the unemployment rate is not statistically significant. Further, IT statistically influences the inflation and unemployment rates throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, its impact on inflation volatility during the COVID-19 pandemic is not evident. Our results have significant policy implications for the Asian economies. It may be suggested that low-income countries could benefit from implementing IT policy as a tool to ensure stable inflation. However, there is a need for continuous policy adaptation and targeted interventions to address evolving economic challenges, especially in situations like crises. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Asian economies; COVID-19 pandemic; difference-in-differences; global financial crisis; inflation targeting; panel-corrected standard error; propensity score matching,

We use a target adjustment model and two-step system generalised method of moments to analyse panel data on a sample of 1435 listed non-financial firms spanning from 2013 to 2022. We find that compared to NFFs, FFs are inherently more indebted and adjust faster towards achieving optimal capital structure. Next, we find that firm's profitability, liquidity and tangibility are the major factors that significantly impact the quantity of debt across different stages of the FLC in both FFs and NFFs. Our results are robust to a battery of sensitivity tests.

The focus of the study is on 52 African countries for the period 2002–2021. The generalised method of moments is employed as estimation strategy and the following findings are established. Debt service has a negative unconditional effect on access to electricity and telecommunication infrastructure. Governance dynamics moderate the negative effect of debt service on infrastructure dynamics. Effective moderation is from regulatory quality and corruption-control for access to electricity and from government effectiveness, regulatory quality, corruption-control and rule of law, for telecommunication infrastructure.

Through a comprehensive analysis of ICO characteristics, we explore the intricate relationship between these attributes and the ultimate success of ICO projects. Our empirical findings show that projects that have secured presale funding, coupled with comprehensive token sale information, exhibit a markedly increased likelihood of achieving ICO success. We also employ the automated machine learning method to offer valuable insights into the potential determinants of ICO success. Furthermore, we delve into the underlying rationale behind ICO success by employing SHAP values to discern the relative importance of various ICO characteristics and examine the correlations among these attributes. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of ICO dynamics and offers empirical evidence regarding the critical factors that shape the success of ICO projects. Such insights hold significant implications for both industry practitioners and policymakers seeking to navigate the evolving landscape of blockchain-based fundraising initiatives. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",automated machine learning; blockchain; cryptocurrency; fundamental analysis; initial coin offering; SHAP value,
Too costly to make a difference: An examination on the relationship between online financing and economic growth,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185132734&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2953&partnerID=40&md5=bc3130583c732495c4d40c90daa99417,"While facilitating people's access to finance and promoting financial coverage, online financing activities involve high capital costs that suppress economic growth. Using 282 Chinese cities during 2011–2020 as the sample, we examine the relationship between online financing and economic growth. Exploiting a variety of models, we find that online financing activities do not have significant effects on economic growth. Further evidence shows that the insignificant relationship between online financing and economic growth also exists in cities with less developed formal financial systems. Our analysis based on the context where borrowers and lenders do not know each other offline implies that the technology intended to promote financial coverage, if not reducing information asymmetry and hence the cost incurred in financial transactions, does not necessarily lead to desirable economic and social outcomes. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",economic growth; Fintech; information asymmetry; online financing,
Partial index tracking enhanced mean–variance portfolio,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188248511&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2967&partnerID=40&md5=897f6df167c296784ad01721985dedd0,"Estimation constitutes a major challenge in the implementation of mean–variance portfolios. To overcome this, we propose a partial index-tracking strategy that aims to mitigate estimation error ex-ante. Theoretically, we minimize the mean-squared error of the proposed strategy by shrinking the portfolio variance to its tracking error. Using an empirical design with over 50 years of data, our paper makes two important observations. First, we show that our proposed approach is consistent with both linear and non-linear shrinkage strategies in terms of robustness. Second, the proposed decision rule leads to a lower out-of-sample tracking error. Our findings, overall, stress the appeal of partial index tracking not only in terms of shrinkage (robustness) but also in terms of relative performance. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",index tracking; out-of-sample robustness; parameter estimation risk; portfolio optimization,
Does a co-opted director affect a firm's financial distress risk?,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188728719&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2959&partnerID=40&md5=47805acca0c445aaa4810d6cd1b85dad,"This study examines the relationship between co-opted directors (CODIR), measured as the fraction of directors appointed after the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) assumes office to board size, and firms' financial distress risk (FFDR). Understanding the relationship between CODIR and FFDR is imperative due to the significant impact of high risk-taking on financial crises and the heightened expectations placed on board members for risk oversight. Despite growing research on corporate governance and FFDR, little attention has been paid to the role of CODIRs, presenting a significant gap in the literature. Using a US sample from 1996 to 2019, covering 13,486 firm-year observations, we document that CODIR reduces FFDR, supporting the hypothesis that co-opted directors have a lower financial distress risk-taking propensity than their non-co-opted counterparts. We also find that a critical mass of at least three CODIRs and independent CODIRs reduces FFDR. Our results also document that CEO power in the form of CEO duality and CEO tenure, external monitoring in the form of the number of analysts following the firm, competition, and takeover susceptibility do not drive our main conclusions for co-option and FFDR. Finally, the results show that CODIR reduces FFDR through liquidity channels. The findings remain robust to various definitions of co-option and distress risk, and are consistent in both difference-in-differences analysis and propensity score matching. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",board composition; Co-opted directors; corporate governance; critical mass; financial distress risk; O-score; Z-score; ZM-score,

For 22 OECD developed countries we use annual data between 1950 and 2019. Other determinants of fiscal responses are also studied in the context of quantile regressions. We find that the output gap contributes to increasing fiscal sustainability by positively influencing the responsiveness of the primary and global government balances; and the responses of the primary and global government balances to the debt ratio and the response of government revenues to government expenditures depend on the level of the debt ratio. In addition, from the quantile analysis, the influence of the response of government revenues to government expenditures is negative and increasing over the deciles, confirming the existence of a negative cross-relationship between the fiscal sustainability coefficients. © 2024 The Authors.

This article utilizes three reductions in the corporate pension insurance contribution ratio in China as a quasi-natural experiment to construct a treatment intensity DID (Difference-in-Differences) model. By utilizing data from listed companies between 2013 and 2020, this study empirically examines the impact of reducing the pension insurance contribution ratio on firms’ TFP while identifying the underlying mechanisms. The findings of the study are as follows: First, the policy exhibits a significant positive effect on corporate TFP in China. Second, this policy's contribution primarily stems from stimulating firms to increase their employment of highly skilled labour, elevating wages for ordinary employees, and enhancing firm investment efficiency. Lastly, the analysis of heterogeneity demonstrates that the policy's positive effect is more pronounced among non-state-owned enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises, and labour-intensive enterprises. This study provides empirical evidence for evaluating the contribution reduction policy and serves as a policy reference for endeavours to deepen the reform of the pension insurance system and enhance pension insurance fund budget management. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",corporate pension insurance; social security; total factor productivity,

We find frequent batch auctions benefit market liquidity but harm market volatility compared to continuous-time auctions. Order cancellation ban harms market quality while the taker fee is beneficial. We also find that market design and policy changes are only effective in low-latency markets. Finally, we address that the total effect of high-frequency trading is positive, so it is vital to reap high-frequency traders' benefits while minimising their harms in high-frequency markets. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",frequent batch auction; high-frequency traders; market design; market policy; market quality; optimal strategy,

We constructed an extensive and up-to-date Global Financial Inclusion database (2011, 2014, 2017, and 2021) to generate 26,185 observations for seven ASEAN countries over a decade, and conducted a separate case study for Singapore, the region's most financially developed member. The results reveal that financial inclusion and financial technology have experienced robust growth in ASEAN but to varying degrees amongst the member countries. Fintech has a significant impact on financial inclusion over the specified period. The relationship between age and financial inclusion follows an inverted U-shaped pattern, with the turning point occurring between the ages of 29 and 45. Surprisingly, gender does not appear to be a determining factor. These results align with the aspirations of ASEAN policymakers to promote financial inclusion in line with the sustainable development goals. © 2024 The Authors.

Thus, the current study investigates the mediating effect of financial inclusion on FinTech innovations and economic development in the Benin Republic. The study is survey research that used a questionnaire from bank customers and residents of suburb areas with a sample size of 357 respondents. The study employed a regression-based data analysis technique using SPSS and SEM-PLS 3 software. The results indicate a positive and significant relationship between FinTech and economic development. In addition, there is a positive and significant association between financial inclusion and economic development. The study also reports a positive and significant mediating role of financial inclusion in the relationship between financial technology and economic development. Consequently, the research confirms that financial inclusion serves as a crucial mechanism through which financial technology influences economic development. In light of these findings, it is recommended that efforts to enhance financial inclusion in the Benin Republic should specifically focus on fostering FinTech innovations to support sustainable economic development. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Benin Republic; credit; economic development; financial inclusion; FinTech; FinTech innovations,

The empirical results are mixed: news events originating in the United States have a greater impact on market contagion compared with those originating in China, especially at lower quantiles. Stock markets respond asymmetrically to good news versus bad news, and the latter lead to a sharper common fall among the markets than the boost to the market caused by good news. We also find evidence that conditional variance and investor sentiment play some role in the spread of financial market crises, despite differences in extent and direction. © 2024 The Authors.

Defence spending and real growth in an asymmetric environment: Accessing evidence from a developing economy,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189504119&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2966&partnerID=40&md5=1aa8e9b594497470db2216f51964ab89,"The connection between the defence spending and real growth remains a forefront subject of theoretical and empirical research. Nigeria, like many other developing nations, continues to devote numerous fiscal resources to military spending in ensuring peaceful coexistence and to attain sustainable economic growth after her independence in 1960. Because the interdependence between them has policy implications, this paper studies whether there exists asymmetric causality between them. The dataset, from World Bank database, includes long-range historical series for military expenditure/GDP ratio and growth rate of GDP, covering 1960–2021. In exploring the empirical relations, the paper shows evidence for the symmetric Granger causality, from Toda–Yamamoto (1995) and asymmetric causality, from Hatemi-J (2012). The standard (symmetric) identifies unidirectional causality evidence, from defence spending to the GDP per capital growth, with no retained potential feedback from real growth to defence spending. The Hatemi-J (asymmetric) causality maintains evidence that positive shocks in the defence spending may cause a positive shock in the GDP per capital, supposing that increase perturbations to defence spending would be productive and growth-enhancing. This causal impact is not evident for positive growth shocks. The findings support the need for policymakers to consider sustained growth targets when redesigning the military budget. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Benoit hypothesis; economic growth; military expenditure; symmetric causality; time-varying asymmetrical causality; Toda–Yamamoto's Granger causality,
The impact of the regulatory business environment on SMEs' funding choices in developing countries: Evidence from Africa,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186249895&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2951&partnerID=40&md5=c2000e10ce21ba939ec01a6a820a6660,"While it is known that some elements of the business environment (BE), such as macroeconomic conditions, impact access to finance and the funding choices of SMEs, very little is known whether other elements of the BE—such as the institutional setting and the regulatory business environment (RBE)—influence access to (or supply of) finance and the funding choices of SMEs. Using a World Bank Enterprise Surveys panel sample (2003–2020) from 30 African countries and employing Propensity Score Matching (PSM) methods, it is noted that while an enabling institutional setting and RBE in Africa increases access to external finance for SMEs, SMEs still opt for retained earnings over funding from banking and non-banking financial institutions for their working capital. This funding behaviour can be explained by that SMEs located in enabling RBEs have increased productivity and financial performance and so can employ larger amounts of retained earnings for their operations. Furthermore, even though more accessible in enabling RBEs, external finance remains unaffordable for most SMEs in Africa. These findings indicate the need to tailor interventions to make varied finance more accessible and affordable for SMEs in developing countries. © 2024 The Authors.

Examination of the intermediate mechanism reveals that ESG can improve TFP by raising R&D investment, enhancing the attention of stakeholders, and increasing internal control capabilities. The heterogeneity study shows that, for state-owned firms, non-polluting industries, and small-scale and low-market degree enterprises, ESG enhances TFP more. Further analysis indicates that ESG uncertainty and ESG catering behaviour will weaken the fostering impact, but environmental regulation has a beneficial regulatory role. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",enterprise total factor productivity; ESG; internal control; R&D investment; stakeholder concern,

We find that domestic factors including economic policy uncertainty, productivity, economic growth, unemployment, inflation expectations and unionization play a stronger role in affecting real wages. Our findings suggest that the direct effects of war-associated geopolitical risks and uncertainty on real wages are temporary. From a policy perspective, the course of real wages will depend more on inflation expectations, productivity and most importantly unionization. We conclude that if real wages in the UK are to rise on a consistent basis then workers and particularly unions will have to gain more bargaining leverage. © 2024 The Authors.

Accordingly, we use data on 98 countries over 9 years to examine whether the use of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) drives bank internationalisation. The results show that the use of IFRS is positively and significantly associated with an increase in foreign investment in the banking sector by easing regulatory compliance. However, in developing countries, the benefit of IFRS increasing foreign investment banks is associated with both easing regulatory compliance and reducing information asymmetry between banks and their clients. Our results are consistent across different sub-samplings, including EU versus non-EU, high versus low absence, and divergence between domestic standard and IFRS. These results provide reassurance and clear evidence of how IFRS facilitates the global flow of capital, even in a highly regulated industry such as banks.

The empirical findings reveal that cyclical or aggressive stocks predominantly act as net transmitters of shocks across sectors. Moreover, short-term spillovers are more significant compared to intermediate-term spillovers, indicating that Japanese sectors are more pronounced to market shocks in the short run. The spillover effects are also asymmetric and vary over time. Additionally, the real estate sector exhibits diversification benefits across different time horizons, while the energy sector provides protection primarily in the short run.

Evidence from China,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187422496&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2964&partnerID=40&md5=358eda0af0b5f22cfae2ac331b816b35,"This paper examines whether gender diversity influences foreign merger and acquisition (M&A) premiums and outcomes in China. Consistent with agency and resource dependence theories, we find that female directors significantly reduce the acquisition premium paid for foreign targets. We show that the market responds positively in the short-term (measured by cumulative abnormal returns) to the announcement of foreign acquisitions by firms with greater female representation in the boardroom. We further find significant evidence that acquirers' boards comprising more female directors experience value creation and better operating synergies (measured by buy-and-hold abnormal returns and changes in return on assets) in the long-term following engagement in foreign M&A deals. Interestingly, after distinguishing between female independent and executive directors, we find that our previous finding on board gender diversity can be attributable to both the monitoring (independent directors) and supervisory (executive directors) roles played by female directors. We also find evidence accords with the argument of the critical mass of female directors' representation in the boardroom. Our results are robust after controlling for endogeneity issues using instrumental variables (IV), propensity score matching (PSM), Heckman, and firm fixed-effects methods. Overall, our findings offer additional empirical support for the global concern by regulators for improving corporate governance practices by increasing female quotas in the boardroom. © 2024 The Authors.

Efficiency and financial risk management practices of microfinance institutions,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186579605&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2956&partnerID=40&md5=d3d67d669e4a65be323d476a2faa76ec,"Microfinance institutions (MFIs) have evolved in different and complex ways to solve various market frictions, with some of them providing a wide range of financial products and using different lending technologies to reach poor and underserved populations. As a result, some MFIs are more efficient than others, but are efficiency gains aligned with risk management practices? The specific characteristics of the microfinance industry make the answer to this question less obvious than that of commercial banks. This paper tries to shed light on these issues by analysing the efficiency and risk management of MFIs and describing the potential implications of these relationships for the microfinance industry. After considering several measures of financial risk management ratios commonly used in the microfinance literature, our results show that cost efficiency improves asset quality and solvency of MFIs, but also reduces the need for holding idle cash or liquid assets. The results of this paper can help academics, policymakers, and regulators to better understand the impact of cost efficiency on financial risks management practices in the microfinance industry. © 2024 The Authors.

Banking uncertainty and corporate financial constraints,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183604236&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2938&partnerID=40&md5=f6ed2c9113f7a85eebf1e556d8f1c35f,"This article investigates an essential channel through which uncertainty may harm the economy—firms' financing constraints. Unlike prior literature focusing on the aspect of aggregate economic policy uncertainty, we look into the dimension of disaggregate uncertainty in the banking system. Examining financial data of commercial banks and listed companies in Vietnam during 2008–2022, we document that banking uncertainty positively impacts corporate financial constraints. Moreover, we explore how firm-specific and macroeconomic factors interact with the relationship between uncertainty and financing constraints. Our analysis indicates that this link is more pronounced for non-state-owned firms, firms with more intangible assets, and firms listed on the Hanoi stock exchange. Meanwhile, macro shocks, such as the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic can strengthen the effect of banking uncertainty on financing constraints. Finally, we examine the mechanisms through which banking uncertainty causes an increase in firms' financial constraints. We document that banking uncertainty exacerbates financial constraints by raising the cost of external financing, not by lowering firm performance. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",banking uncertainty; COVID-19 pandemic; financial constraints; financial crisis; financing costs; firm performance,
The asymmetric role of temperature deviations in economic growth: Fresh evidence from global countries and panel quantile estimates,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185446047&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2952&partnerID=40&md5=414a5ea43e527ab82976b05ebca0c5c8,"This work explores the role of weather shocks, measured as temperature deviations from their normal, in affecting GDP growth through a panel of 148 countries, spanning the period 1960–2019 and a panel quantile approach. The findings show that GDP growth is negatively affected by such deviations at higher quantiles, with the results receiving robust support from three alternative methodologies. The analysis also identifies two channels through which the findings receive further support, such as, the ‘heat-exposed’ sectors effect on labour productivity, and the impact of temperature deviations on the capital accumulation capacity. The results also survive the role of the country development status. Finally, the analysis identifies the role of the countries' geographical location. The results can have substantial merit for policymakers in terms of the role of climate conditions in the growth process, especially in poor countries. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",climate change; economic growth; quantile regression; temperature deviations,
Bank leverage and systemic risk: Impact of bank risk-taking and inter-bank business,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189949279&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2973&partnerID=40&md5=f92d8de9150f3b6566511146b3f41641,"In order to prevent and resolve systemic risk more effectively through deleveraging policy, this research takes China A-share listed commercial banks from 2011 to 2021 as samples, calculates the systemic risk spillover through the conditional value at risk model, re-estimates the leverage ratio with reference to the “Administration Measures for the Leverage Ratio of Commercial Banks (revised)”, and evaluates the influence of the leverage ratio on systemic risk. The results show that a high leverage ratio increases systemic risk spillover, and under this increase state-owned commercial banks have the greatest contribution. Further research presents that a better leverage ratio enhances the systemic risk spillover by improving bank risk-taking and encouraging inter-bank business expansion. In addition, over different periods of economic development the influence of the leverage ratio on systemic risk exudes different characteristics. During an economic upswing, the leverage ratio's impact on systemic risk significantly drops. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Bank leverage ratio; China; systemic risk spillover; ΔCoVaR,
Effects of QE on sovereign bond spreads through the safe asset channel,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187886788&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2958&partnerID=40&md5=3f1845ff664f9a79d801c7b5420a6f2c,"We show that through the safe asset channel the excess liquidity created by large scale asset purchases (QE) can lead to higher sovereign bond spreads in the euro area. This unintended effect is most likely in volatile market conditions when excess liquidity spurs demand for tradeable safe assets, pushing down the interest rate of these assets, which widens risk spreads. Outcomes of a panel regression model estimated for individual euro area countries confirm that the excess liquidity created by QE had an upward effect on sovereign bond spreads. It indicates that the safe asset channel dominates the usual portfolio rebalancing channel. For monetary policy the results imply that large scale asset purchases by QE are not an appropriate instrument to address country specific shocks. © 2024 The Authors.

How do the reserve currency and uncertainties in major markets affect the uncertainty of oil prices over time?,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187479029&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2962&partnerID=40&md5=55a2e24fcbcedc1836b4c09e730aba18,"This research aims to understand how certain events, like the global financial crisis, the post-global financial crisis period, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine war, along with changes in the value of the US dollar and uncertainty in gold, currency, and stock markets, affect the uncertainty in oil prices. We are particularly interested in looking at positive and negative changes in these factors when oil price uncertainty is either high or low. To achieve this, we use a quantile regression method, which allows us to analyse different levels of oil price uncertainty effectively. Throughout the whole timeframe we looked at, the initial findings suggest that when there is much uncertainty in the oil market, the US dollar and uncertainty in major markets have a bigger influence on making the oil market more uncertain, compared to times when there is not much uncertainty about oil prices. We also noticed that the impacts of negative and positive changes in the reserve currency, and uncertainties are quite different when crises happen. To cite an example, when there is much uncertainty about oil prices, positive expectations about economic activity (because the reserve currency is weaker) and confidence in the stock market (less worry about a shock in the stock market) have a stronger impact, reducing uncertainty in oil prices during the global financial crisis. On the other hand, more negative effects from pessimistic expectations (due to a stronger US dollar and increased fear of a shock in the stock market) lead to higher oil price uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to what we have discovered in our analysis, policymakers and investors should evaluate how both negative and positive shifts in the reserve currency (US dollar) and uncertainties in gold, currency, and stock markets separately affect the uncertainty in oil prices. It is important to understand that these effects vary depending on the level of uncertainty in oil prices and the direction (positive or negative) and timing of the changes. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",asymmetric impact; economic crisis; oil price; quantile regression; reserve currency; uncertainty,
How culture and legal environment affect classification shifting?

Given that both culture and the legal environment tend to exhibit low variability over time, our international cross-country analysis with diverse cultural dimensions and legal frameworks enhances the robustness of our empirical findings. Our identification strategy employs several models and shows the significant impact of culture on classification shifting and the interactions between national culture and the legal environment on classification shifting behaviour, though there is variability across countries. We also find that certain traits of culture induce classification shifting. We highlight that strengthening the legal environment becomes crucial in creating an institutional framework that effectively curbs unethical practices induced by certain national culture traits and enhances transparency and accountability in financial reporting. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",classification shifting; earnings management; financial reporting; international sample; legal environment; national culture,

Using these estimated correlations, we investigate the impact of dividend payouts on the diversification potential of REITs for stock market investors. Our choice of the Turkish REIT market is based on its unique REIT dividend policy, while US data provide a benchmark for comparison. This study has a number of motivations and contributions that make it a worthwhile undertaking. First, we document that REIT dividend policy is related to the correlation between REIT and stock markets. Dividend paying REITs have lower correlations with stock markets, which makes the REIT market a viable portfolio diversifier. Second, we confirm that REITs and stock prices cointegrated more closely due to the 2008 global financial crisis. We additionally document that a similar effect was also present in the correlation during the global Covid-19 pandemic crisis. It appears that REIT and stock markets become more correlated during times of financial turmoil and diversification opportunities are diminished. Finally, we document that there is a long-term trend in the time-varying correlations between REIT and stock markets. Türkiye has been experiencing a negative trend in this regard, while the US has been experiencing a positive trend. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",correlations; DCC-GARCH; diversification; dividend policy; structural break; trend; Turkish REITs,

This study examines the tail connectivity among three distinct markets—conventional, religious, and sustainable—and uses a new neural network quantile regression technique to quantify their risk exposure. The findings suggest that traditional and religious investments have the greatest tail risk exposure during crises, emphasising the importance of diversification using sustainable investments. The Systematic Network Risk Index identifies intense events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the European debt crisis, and the global financial crisis, as having the greatest tail risk. The Systematic Fragility Index finds the Islamic stocks during the COVID-19 crisis and the conventional stock market before the pandemic to the highly vulnerable markets. On the other hand, the Systemic Hazard Index identifies Islamic stocks as the primary source of systemic risk. The study concludes by providing implications for decision-makers, regulatory authorities, investors, players in the financial system, and investment managers to diversify their risk by utilising green/sustainable investments. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",CoVaR; COVID-19; neural networks; religious investments; sustainable investments,

We find that CEOs with a high–power distance heritage are more likely to increase R&D. We confirm that this effect of CEO power distance is robust to other cultural effects, the model specification, and endogeneity issues. We conjecture that CEOs with a high–power distance heritage are more likely to increase R&D expenditures because they use their power to pursue personal objectives. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that R&D increases made by CEOs with a high–power distance culture generate significantly lower benefits in the future, reflecting the inefficiency of these R&D investment decisions. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",CEO; corporate innovation; cultural heritage; culture; investment; power distance; R&D expenditures,

In developing the ICAS framework, we address methodological issues such as the predictive performance of statistical versus machine learning approaches and the imbalanced dataset problem, indicating ways to evaluate such models with strong predictive power. Our findings suggest that the effect of the financial support measures dominates the pandemic shocks, thus substantially reducing the probability of firms' default, while the size- and industry-based models show that firms in the micro and services sectors benefited the most. Furthermore, using a random forest model, our findings highlight the trade-off between the transparency of traditional statistical models and the predictive value of machine learning models. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",COVID-19; credit risk; default; government financial support measures; in-house credit assessment system; machine learning,

The results of the econometric investigation using a large sample of American commercial banks show that profit efficiency indicators including leverage are better predictors of future profits than current indicators, including other measures of bank risk. This is particularly evident for the period during the 2007–2009 financial crisis.

Directors' and officers' liability insurance and minority shareholders' participation in corporate governance,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187169058&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2961&partnerID=40&md5=0e82e8fe3c6d08df4cef1590b4304807,"This study empirically investigates the influence of directors' and officers' liability insurance (D&O insurance) on minority shareholders' participation in corporate governance. Using a sample from Chinese A-share listed companies between 2011 and 2018, we find that D&O insurance can significantly decrease the participation of minority shareholders, and this conclusion remains valid after robustness checks. The mechanism analysis demonstrates that D&O insurance plays a positive role in diminishing minority shareholders' participation through the enhancement of firm performance. Further analyses suggest that the negative association between D&O insurance and minority shareholders' participation is more pronounced in firms with weaker corporate governance practices. These findings provide evidence for the supervisory governance role of D&O insurance, suggesting China should consider encouraging listed companies to purchase D&O insurance for the protection of minority shareholders. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",corporate governance; directors' and officers' liability insurance; minority shareholder protection; minority shareholders' activism,
Financialisation of the European Union Emissions Trading System European Union Emissions Trading System and its influencing factors in quantiles,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186189979&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2950&partnerID=40&md5=ccc80f232acf41daeb74cb736a60fd56,"This study analyses the financialisation of the carbon market and its possible external shocks, with a focus on the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), by investigating its quantile dependence and influence paths from stage three onwards. To achieve this, we construct a theoretical model of five factors related to the financialisation of the carbon market and empirically investigate the significant influencing factors and their influence paths under different quantiles using quantile group Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and quantile regression models. We find that the price of WTI crude oil and the market risk-aversion index have a significant effect on the financialisation of the EU ETS at extremely high quantiles. Factors such as the WTI crude oil price, precipitation, average share price of thermal power companies, and the federal funds rate have a statistically significant impact on the medium quantiles. However, we find no significant influence at extremely low quantiles, indicating that policy instruments are necessary to effectively regulate the operation of the carbon market. Therefore, it is crucial for carbon market stakeholders to pay close attention to these factors and adapt to changing market conditions. © 2024 The Authors.

Digitalization and firms' systematic risk in China,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182440372&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2931&partnerID=40&md5=0a0690bd3f60d6ed148db1c116c9285c,"Previous literature indicates that digitalization offers enterprises competitive advantages. However, However, its potential impact on risk management remains uncertain. Thus, this study explores the causality between digital transformation and systematic risk of Chinese public companies during 2007–2020. We developed a digital-related keywords dictionary using textual analysis to identify investments in digital assets which serve as a measure of corporate digitalization. Our findings suggest a negative correlation between digital transformation and enterprise systematic risk. This relationship is further supported by robustness tests, adjustments for endogeneity, and random forest predictions. The risk-reducing effect of digitalization is more pronounced in non-state-owned, small, high-asset-density, and low-investor-attention enterprises. Additionally, we explore potential mechanisms: the financial leverage channel, operating leverage channel, and investor loyalty channel. Empirical observations indicate that enterprise digitalization: (1) lowers financing costs, curbing an inclination towards excessive debt; (2) enhances operational cost management and stimulates sales growth; and (3) boosts long-term investor holdings, decreases stock price synchronization, and mitigates crash risks. This study offers new insights into assessing the sustainability of digitalization and mitigating systematic risks of enterprises. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",China; enterprise digitalization; mechanisms; systematic risk; textual analysis,
Does environmental credit affect bank loans? Evidence from Chinese A-share listed firms,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188253089&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2968&partnerID=40&md5=1b8d13e12ef7c0a1456268ad2cbae0bc,"We investigate the effect of government-initiated enterprise environmental credit ratings on firms' bank loans. While prior research indicates that companies with superior environmental performance tend to secure more bank loans, it is crucial to acknowledge that these performance metrics predominantly rely on voluntary corporate social responsibility or environmental, social, and governance disclosures made by the firms themselves or evaluated by third-party agencies. Consequently, the evaluation results could be biased due to incomplete information disclosure, methodologies, or systems, raising concerns among scholars about potential “greenwashing” or symbolic environmental actions. In contrast, we employ a dataset comprising 27,388 observations from 2009 to 2021, applying propensity score matching and a time-varying difference-in-difference model to better discern the relationship between firms' environmental credit ratings and their ability to obtain bank loans. Our findings highlight that firms participating in environmental credit evaluation can secure more bank loans compared to non-participating firms. This effect is especially pronounced in regions with advanced green finance development. Further analysis shows that non-state-owned enterprises with excellent or good environmental credit ratings receive more loans, thus mitigating ownership bias in loan distribution. Overall, our results demonstrate that mandatory government environmental credit ratings mitigate information asymmetry by enabling lenders to better understand firms' environmental information. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",bank loans; environmental credit; green finance; ownership; sustainability,

The empirical results show that the increase in post-inclusion implied betas is significantly smaller than the corresponding increase in historical or hybrid betas. In most cases, changes in implied betas show no evidence of excess comovement after S&P 500 index inclusion. Our findings suggest that added stocks experience changes prior to the index addition announcement and this leads to the ‘index inclusion effect’ reported to the literature. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",historical beta; implied beta; index inclusion effect,empirical analysis; historical perspective; market conditions; stock market

First, in the short term, there is market inefficiency allowing for investment and diversification opportunities and a need for greater market transparency. Second, the spread between wine markets and financial markets can disappear in the long term, that is, there is a long-run relationship that is relatively compatible with efficiency, except for the Bordeaux Legends 50 index. This implies greater efficiency and therefore better information and fewer investment and diversification opportunities. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",efficiency tests; fine wines; inefficiency market; time-series analysis,efficiency measurement; investment; time series analysis; wine industry

The empirical results highlight three interesting and noteworthy aspects for investors and regulators: first, the spillover behaviours of China's sectoral stock markets reveal significant heterogeneity. The Energy, Materials, Industries, Optional, Consumption, Information, and PublicUtilities markets are net transmitters, while the Pharmaceutical, Finance, and Telecom ones are net receivers. Second, the spillover effects between China's commodity and sectoral stock markets are enhanced under extreme conditions and are approximately 18.49% higher than those under normal conditions, and there is asymmetry between left-tail and right-tail spillovers, which was observed during China's stock market crash.

Better understanding of the spillover of news sentiment to stock markets could aid the decision-making of institutional investors when strong uncertainty is present across major economies. We found that limited spillover from news sentiment to equity markets existed for both the European and international indices examined in the analysis, with spillover being stronger among smaller subsets of news articles more relevant for financial market participants. Additionally, the results indicated that, in the full sample, directional spillover was especially strong in times of larger uncertainty concerning BREXIT developments, whereas the smaller subsets, although also displaying stronger spillover during BREXIT uncertainty, revealed additional spillover peaks at times less related to major BREXIT developments. Differentiation between news about UK-based and EU-based companies also showed less spillover from news sentiment regarding EU-based companies, possibly implying that investors saw BREXIT developments as less relevant for the latter. © 2022 The Authors.

This article hypothesises a nonlinear relationship between trade credit and corporate growth due to the existing theoretical arguments on the benefit and cost of using suppliers' credit by corporations to enhance growth. Based on a panel of 23,023 non-financial companies from the United Kingdom over a 10-year period, evidence from this study reveals a nonlinear (concave) relation between trade credit and corporate growth: positive for low trade credit received and negative for high credit received. We also find trade credit to be sensitive to financial crisis, financial constraints and growth strategy. The predictability is stronger during a financial crisis, among financially constrained corporations and corporations pursuing an aggressive growth strategy. We also find growth to be higher in firms that move closer to achieving an optimal credit level. This relationship holds for both the above- and below-optimal deviations. These findings have implications for a more balanced and nuanced view of trade credit management. © 2022 The Authors.

From fears to recession?

Our empirical results mainly show that cross-market risk spillovers between these two types of markets are rare over the whole crisis period. Adding CDS assets to the stock portfolio would significantly decrease the overall risk spillovers in the mixed portfolio. Then, the time-frequency spillover and rolling window analyses confirm this finding and provide further evidence of frequency heterogeneity of risk spillovers during the pandemic. The outbreak of the COVID pandemic only sharply increases short-term risk spillovers between the stock and sovereign CDS market but exerts insignificant impacts on the medium and long-term cross-market risk spillovers. Moreover, our results show that developed countries are net transmitters in the stock markets. In contrast, the emerging markets account for the most risk spillovers in sovereign CDS markets over the sample period, emphasizing the heterogenous adverse impacts of the pandemic across various countries and markets. Finally, we find that bailouts implemented by the US and EU central banks, though with heterogeneous impacts across frequencies, gradually enhance the confidence and resilience of investors in these markets. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",CDS markets; connectedness; COVID-19; risk spillover,Europe; United States; central bank; COVID-19; credit provision; disease spread; epidemic; spillover effect; stock market
Does economic complexity influence environmental performance?

Our view is that a country's productive structure, reflected through its knowledge content and technical capabilities (economic complexity), is strongly correlated with its environmental performance. To empirically confirm this view, the link between economic complexity and environmental performance in member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) was examined within a modified version of the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model incorporating two alternative measures of economic complexity. The model was estimated using the fixed effects extension proposed by Driscoll and Kraay (DK-FE) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation techniques. Granger causality testing in frequency domain was also employed to examine country-specific relationships. The sample period extended from 2007 to 2016. The study findings provided reliable empirical justification for our position. The coefficients for economic complexity in the long-run estimations revealed that economic complexity positively impacted on environmental performance in the OECD countries. Granger causality outcomes also indicated economic complexity as a meaningful predictor of environmental performance in most of the OECD countries. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",economic complexity; environmental performance; OECD countries; panel data modelling; STIRPAT,complexity; economic conditions; environmental degradation; environmental economics; Granger causality test; measurement method; OECD; panel data; performance assessment; sustainability

To explore the potential heterogeneity in the impacts that can arise from the different types and directions of capital flows, we classify them according to whether they involve foreign direct investment (FDI) or foreign portfolio investment (FPI) and examine these inflows and outflows separately. The characteristics of these different types of capital flows and their effects on the real exchange rate in both advanced and emerging markets during 2002–2017 are investigated using a set of estimation approaches. To capture the relationship between real exchange rates and capital flows while controlling for other variables, a dynamic panel data model is utilized for the dataset covering emerging countries. Key findings suggest that the composition of capital flows determines the impact of those flows on real exchange rates, whereby FPI brings a faster appreciation of the real exchange rate than FDI and capital outflows bring a sharper degree of exchange rate adjustment than capital inflows.

This indicates that official TV news leads inflation expectations. Furthermore, positive causalities from CCTV reports to the expectation heterogeneity also exist, thus meaning that more official reports may exacerbate the disagreement among households' expectations, thereby contributing to the macroeconomic instability.

We also find that the impacts of leverage deviation on the likelihood of bidders engaging in a minority or majority acquisition is asymmetric for underleveraged and overleveraged firms. In addition, international bidders are less likely to take a minority acquisition if the target is operating in (i) countries with a higher degree of Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, (ii) countries with higher degree to which individuals are able to participate in selecting their government, as well as having more freedom of expression, freedom of association, and a free media. Lastly, minority acquisitions are more common in a country with a more developed market. As such, in a fluid social order it looks like acquirers really need majority control. © 2022 The Authors.

Through the role of institutional investors, the external monitoring mechanism is expected to reduce the cost associated with the agency problem amongst Malaysian companies, as shown by the lack of ethical practises. Using data from 429 publicly listed companies on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia from 2012 to 2021, the results show that companies with higher ETHICS have better financial performance than companies with lower ETHICS. However, the findings on the moderating effect of institutional investors cannot be proven. By separating the sample based on pre-MCCG 2017, institutional investors were found to have an association between ETHICS and performance, but no evidence was found during the period post-MCCG 2017. This study adds to the perspective of agency theory in the academic literature, of which companies can create values by being committed to higher ethical practises. Results on the moderating effect of institutional investors provide perspective on external monitoring mechanisms in the Malaysian market because they are found to have a monitoring role in enhancing corporate performance. However, such a role decreases after the introduction of MCCG 2017. This study provides insights for Malaysian regulators on the necessity to keep promoting ethical practises and transparency amongst companies to achieve the goals of the National Anti-Corruption Plan 2019–2023. The ethical practises, however, are not limited to listed companies, and regulators should also consider monitoring the institutions within the capital market. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",agency theory; ethics; financial performance; institutional shareholder,Malaysia; economic activity; ethics; financial market; financial system; institutional framework; stock market

Additionally, we visualise dynamic idiosyncratic networks and confirm that their evolutionary pattern is similar to that of systemic risk. Moreover, we further explore systemic risk and idiosyncratic networks at an individual level and determine that in-degree and in-strength measures negatively influence systemic risk. This indicates that a well-connected idiosyncratic network in the banking system is prone to risk spillover and cause idiosyncratic contagion. The results of the network analysis indicate that global banking idiosyncratic networks are a complex system and can serve as a valuable reference for investors and policymakers. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",conditional granger causality; idiosyncratic contagion; network analysis; risk spillover; systemic risk,banking; Granger causality test; investment; network analysis; risk assessment
Does Renminbi internationalization matter for petroleum security in China?

For China, petroleum security means supply security. The paper disaggregates petroleum security into three dimensions (domestic petroleum price—DOP, petroleum supply—PS and petroleum reserve—PR) and examines the impact of Renminbi internationalization (RMBI) on these dimensions based on linear auto regressive distributed lag (ARDL) procedure, and monthly data spanning from 2011M01 to 2022M03. The empirical results reveal evidence of long run equilibrium relationship between PR, PS and RMBI. On the long run and short run dynamics, RMBI is inversely related to DOP both in the short run and long run, but the impact is less than proportionately. However, RMBI and PS co-move in the short run with 0.24% margin. In the same vein, RMBI and PR co-move both in the short run and long run significantly. The impact of international oil price is positive on DOP but negative on PS and PR at least in the short run. Our finding signalled to the fact that increasing acceptance of the RMB in trade settlements and crude oil invoicing serve as a comparative advantage for China to engage in oil trade and complement the oil demand growth threatening the country's energy security drive. Therefore, we suggest diversification of crude oil import sources especially to regions/countries where RMB has been widely accepted. Prominence should be given to government controlled Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPRs) and large oil companies should be compelled to raise the level of mandatory oil reserve for sustainable supply that keep pace with the growing demand for oil. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",ARDL; petroleum security; renminbi internationalization; strategic reserve,China; energy resource; globalization; national security; oil supply; petroleum; time series analysis

We then explore three possible causes of the trade imbalances, which are the fiscal channel, the investment channel and the competitiveness channel. We find that all three channels are important in explaining the emergence and correction of trade imbalances. In particular, we find that an increase in fiscal deficits in the North are twice as effective in reducing trade imbalances than fiscal consolidation in the South. By contrast, increased investment in the North has a similar impact to reduced investment in the South in correcting the trade imbalances.

"Competition, stability, and institutional environment: The case of dual banking economies",2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138536666&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2700&partnerID=40&md5=a71258d1a4290513dda36938a5556f82,"We measure the impact of competition and institutional quality on stability for dual banking economies. Our sample comprises 492 banks (109 Islamic and 383 conventional banks) from 17 countries with dual-banking systems. The sample period is from 2005 to 2020. The estimations are performed using Two Step System Generalized Method of Moments approach. Our findings reveal heterogeneous effect of competition on stability. We found the evidence of competition-stability paradigm in case of full sample as well as for Islamic banks. There is no effect of competition on the stability of conventional banks. Furthermore, there is no evidence of size effect in the competition-stability results. The impact of legal institution is insignificant. We also observe that better quality of political and the economic institutions increases the bank stability. We attribute these findings to the conjecture that better political and/or legal institutions improve bank stability by reducing information asymmetry and adverse selection. Finally, we find the evidence that political, legal and economic dimensions of institutions have differential effect on competition-stability relationship. The findings are robust to alternative definitions of competition, stability and different methodological approaches. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",competition; dual banking; economic institutions; Islamic finance; legal institutions; political institutions; stability,asymmetry; banking; competition (economics); institutional framework; Islamism; political economy
Emerging influence of the RMB on currency markets in a transpiring tri-polar international monetary system,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139649661&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2693&partnerID=40&md5=3f263606f73dbd375f4770b079777ad3,"The up-and-coming influence of the RMB on currency co-movements is examined in this paper, in the context of a transpiring tri-polar international monetary system advocated in prior studies. The study is empirically conducted against the backdrop of a more variable RMB exchange rate regime, which enables the integration of the RMB into the international monetary system. The influence of the RMB is found most evident in Asia, being modest in Latin America while reaching Africa. The RMB co-moves most with the currencies of countries that have large shares in trade with China considerably. Meanwhile, a residual-based instrumental variables model is proposed in this study purposely for dealing with issues of common factor dominance, which prevails in currency co-movements. The emerging influence of the RMB on currency co-movements arises at the time when a multiple-reserve currency system is coming, and the RMB is included as the third largest currency in the SDR basket. It is shored up by the improved infrastructure, strengthened central bank cooperation and expanded networks for cross-border RMB payments and settlements. It is concluded that the RMB has increasingly integrated into the international monetary system as one of the major players, effecting currency market movements actively alongside the US dollar and euro. © 2022 The Authors.

The effects of financial constraints on the market value of cash in a mandatory dividend context,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148369553&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2719&partnerID=40&md5=ff5e0f687412a9feaf816f3ec34be1f9,"This article aims to shed light on the effects of financial constraints on the value shareholders attribute to cash holdings in firms listed on the Brazilian stock exchange, where corporate law determines that publicly listed companies set aside part of their annual profits for dividend payments. While prior empirical literature provides evidence that cash holdings are more valuable for financially constrained companies than for their unconstrained counterparts, we cannot support the hypothesis that the market value of cash increases as obtaining access to external funds becomes more difficult. Our analysis also reveals that constrained companies do not hold significantly higher cash savings than their unconstrained peers. This last result, in turn, is not in line with the precautionary motive for having cash. Moreover, although the principal argument for adopting mandatory dividend rules in Brazil was to increase the protection of minority shareholders, we observe that the contribution of cash holdings to firm value is still small in Brazil, especially in dual-class companies, because investors expect cash holdings to be partly consumed as private benefits due to the presence of significant agency problems. This research is relevant because it serves as an additional step in understanding how a legal mechanism established by a government to protect investors affects the contribution of cash holdings to firm value. Governments that intend to adopt mandatory dividend rules to safeguard the cash-flow rights of minority shareholders can use our findings to make better decisions regarding whether to enforce compulsory dividend payments. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",cash holdings; mandatory dividend rules; precautionary motive; value of cash,Brazil; corporate strategy; investment; legal rights; precautionary principle; stock market; valuation

After the implementation of this policy, what changes have taken place in the behaviour of auditors after the implementation of this policy? What impact has it had on the audit report? A series of problems deserve systematic analysis and empirical testing. This paper examines the relationship between the communication of KAMs and earnings management. We examined quasi-natural experimental data shaped by new auditing standards issued by the Ministry of Finance of China on 23 December 2016. The new auditing standards have been implemented in phases for the listed companies. We find that (1) communicating KAMs in audit reports restrains the auditor's motivational reasoning behaviour by triggering rationality constraints and improves the auditor's professional scepticism, thus improving audit quality and significantly reducing the company's accrued earnings management level. (2) The influence of communicating KAMs on earnings management is more significant for sampled firms with high external financing dependence and low marketization, revealing its supplementary role in the existing corporate governance mechanism. The findings of this paper enrich existing research on KAMs and supplement important empirical evidence from the Chinese market for assessing the effects of audit reporting reforms worldwide. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",audit report; earnings management; key audit matters; motivated reasoning; PSM-DID,China; governance approach; management; market system
Joint calibration of S&P 500 and VIX options under local stochastic volatility models,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136477952&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2686&partnerID=40&md5=fa041ac1d5ffb1fdc27e299a95e308b2,"It is extremely challenging to design a model calibrating both SPX and VIX option prices. A long-standing conjecture due to Julien Guyon is that it may not be possible to calibrate these two quantities with a continuous model. So far, most studied continuous time models are affine, so we investigate the conjecture among 14 well-known non-affine local stochastic volatility models in this article. First, we propose a unified efficient willow tree method for S&P500 and VIX option pricing under non-affine models. Second, we compare the joint calibration performance on these 14 models on the S&P500 and VIX option prices data from 2006 to 2019. We find that the VIX option price data can provide extra information of the variance dynamics of the models, and the non-affine structure and the volatility with linear, rather than square-root, diffusion process provide a better fit for the both data sets than the affine counterparts. Among the 14 stochastic models, the SABR model provides the best in- and out-of-sample performance (in terms of mean square error) regardless of the state of the economy. Nevertheless, even for the best-fitted SABR model, the relative error on the VIX option is still around 18%, still quite significant. Therefore, we found the non-affine and local volatility structure improve the joint calibration but are still far from satisfactory. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",local stochastic volatility models; nonaffine models; option pricing; S&P 500 index; VIX; willow tree,data set; diffusion; performance assessment; price dynamics; stochasticity

Yet, its efficiency and productivity has rarely being investigated. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of insurers' performance in the U.K. insurance market from 1996 to 2017, using stochastic frontier analysis to measure efficiency scores and productivity at the firm level. Results show the U.K. insurance industry could improve by about 40% in terms of cost efficiency and by 70% in terms of profit efficiency. In addition, our model reveals a higher cost efficiency score compared to profit efficiency, implying that there are higher inefficiencies on the income side of the insurance industry as measured by our profit function. In terms of total factor productivity (TFP) growth, we report a steady decline over time while on average is negative. By decomposing TFP growth into its underlying components, we reveal that the reported negative trend in TFP growth over time has mainly been driven by the enhanced competition that resulted in a drop in markup, while the scale and cost efficiency has also driven TFP growth down. However, from a positive point of view, we report evidence of both β-convergence and σ-convergence in cost and profit efficiency. © 2023 The Authors.

Stock Market Efficiency in Asia: Evidence from the Narayan–Liu–Westerlund's GARCH-based unit root test,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135206004&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2676&partnerID=40&md5=b831f2cca7b9eb5f5f6c8860c5a3e786,"Stock market integration with efficiency is important in finance. This study therefore analyses the stock market efficiency in Vietnam and other Asian countries by using the recently developed Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH)-based unit root test of Narayan et al. to examine the stock market efficiency of Vietnam and other 18 Asian countries, using daily prices. Particularly, we examine weather stock market prices in these countries reflects all available information. The model flexibly accounts for heteroskedasticity and two structural breaks, the presence of which can lead to inaccurate results if neglected. Our results disclose the stock markets of 14 countries as inefficient following the rejection of the unit root null hypothesis. However, the stock markets of China, Hong Kong, Japan, and the Korea Republic are adjudged efficient. We further extend the model to accommodate a maximum of five breaks to check the robustness of our results to higher breaks. We observe that the results are largely consistent except for Lebanon and Singapore. For completeness, we compare the results with those of conventional GARCH models that do not account for structural breaks and discover differing results for some countries. Hence, the role of structural breaks is not negligible in assessing market efficiency. Future studies should also incorporate heteroskedasticity and structural breaks in their modelling framework to obtain accurate results. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Asia; GARCH; stock market efficiency; structural breaks; unit root,Asia; accuracy assessment; efficiency measurement; financial system; market conditions; regional economy; stock market; structural adjustment

We further find that the monitoring effect of leverage on investment is stronger on firms operating in low regulatory quality and corrupt environments. Finally, we show that the monitoring effect induced by ownership concentration complements the monitoring effect of leverage on investment. Overall, our results suggest that the increased debt levels reported in emerging markets in recent years, act as a disciplinary tool against overinvestment, especially in countries with weak institutional environments. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",capital structure; emerging markets; institutional quality; investment; leverage; ownership concentration,capital; economic growth; investment; ownership

Economic performance affects political results, and the political environment and its process produce financial results. Brazil was hit by economic and political crises from 2012 to 2016. Such crises made it possible to redesign the correlation network between the assets negotiated on the B3 (Brazil Stock Exchange and Over-the-Counter Market). This paper aimed to analyse the main aspects related to the topological structure of the assets negotiated on the B3 and its volatility between the pre-and post-2014 electoral periods. Results showed the hierarchical clusters and the evolution of the systemic risk, with the banks leading the concentration in the post-electoral period. The closeness centrality indices for the minimum variance portfolios were modified by approximately 80% between the pre-electoral and post-electoral periods. It was concluded that the political events significantly changed the structure, the risk and the possibility of selecting assets for portfolios in the Brazilian market. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",analysis theory; cluster analysis; crisis management; financial risk; network formation; portfolio choice; risk management,Brazil; banking; cluster analysis; data set; financial crisis; financial market; risk assessment

For this purpose, a simultaneous equations approach was considered to investigate the dynamics between efficiency and stability. Our framework follows the premise that stability is endogenously related to efficiency only for Moroccan banks' sample when models' estimation has been administered considering each country separately. The findings reveal also the persistence of a positive effect of foreign ownership on bank efficiency, highlighting that banking efficiency need be effectively sustained with a reasonable level of institutional development. Moreover, the institutional differences characterizing the home and host countries has a negative impact on the foreign banks' stability. Accordingly, policy makers in the Great Maghreb area could well aspire to enhance foreign ownership in their banking sector, on the ground that it helps remarkably in improving corporate governance and boosting efficiency, given mainly the acquired technical advantages often associated with their developed home countries. The generalized moments method estimator outlines the persistence of a noticeable banking inefficiency and stability, with a significant effect of the stability variable on banks' inefficiency and performance, suggesting that banking-efficiency boosting policies might well ultimately guide and veer management choices towards less risky investments. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",cost efficiency; foreign ownership; GMM model; institutional quality indicator; risk-efficiency relationship; simultaneous equations models,Morocco; Tunisia; banking; cost analysis; investment; policy making; risk assessment

Better ways to test for herding,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138990696&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2707&partnerID=40&md5=f4a718faadcfd5bf6f2dbf313628cac5,"In this article, we outline problems with the standard test for herding developed by Chang, Cheng and Kohrana (2000), subsequently called the CCK test, which is based on the proposition that the cross-sectional absolute deviation of stock returns (CSAD) should be linearly related to overall market returns. We show that the test is highly biased against finding herding. The bias arises because the test assumes that, in the absence of herding, stock prices follow the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) but does not account for the implications of the CAPM not being a perfect asset pricing model. We suggest several simple alternative tests for herding. Finally, we show that the new tests give radically different results to the CCK test finding herding in many of the world's major financial markets when the CCK test rejects herding. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",CAPM; CCK test; CSAD; herding; stock markets,capital; financial market; price determination; stock market; testing method
Systemic risk in the Scandinavian banking sector,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138535670&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2699&partnerID=40&md5=2f64f38582cd09a20601cf1cef95fff4,"The banking sectors in the Scandinavian countries are highly concentrated, typically undercapitalised and they have suffered through several crises since the 1990s. This article analyses the systemic risk in Denmark, Norway and Sweden focusing on the co-dependence in the tails of equity returns of an individual bank and the overall banking system. We use, partly in a new way, conditional cross-quantilograms (CQs) for this purpose. We find that the CQs are positive and statistically significant in the low and high quantiles indicating that the Scandinavian banks are systemically linked. The low-quantile dependence is relatively stronger compared with the magnitude of dependence in the other quantiles. These results hold even after controlling for equity market volatility and economic policy uncertainty. We further observe that the systemic risk was insignificant from the early—2000 to the outbreak of the global financial crisis (GFC). However, after the GFC and the euro zone crisis, the systemic risk has increased substantially. Finally, we find that bank size has a positive relationship with systemic risk (low-quantile dependence) while return on asset and loan to deposit ratio exhibit a negative influence. Furthermore, these relationships are asymmetric across quantiles. © 2022 The Authors.

We empirically examine the implications of institutional theory within the banking sector context and provide classification of our sampled banks. In addition, a tailored sustainability index has been developed and content analysis has been employed to examine the current sustainability disclosure in the EU and the US banking sector. Using a sample of 483 report-year observations, the results reveal that the EU banks have carried out more sustainability disclosure compared with US banks, and banks in both regions are mostly interested in how their operations influence the society that banks operate in (direct social impact), followed by the indirect environmental impact of their products and services. We find evidence of the applicability of institutional theory in sustainability communications within our sample. Therefore, our findings provide a clearer breakdown of sustainability disclosure in the banking sector using a cross-country context. Finally, we update our sample to include 67 EU banks matched by 67 US banks for the period from 2013 to 2021 and use ESG scores to reflect the sustainability dimension and we report that EU banks outperform the US banks in three dimensions (the direct social, the direct environmental and the indirect social scores), while the US banks have the lead in the indirect environmental sustainability scores. © 2022 The Authors.

Macroeconomic determinants of households' indebtedness in Portugal: What really matters in the era of financialisation?,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137580258&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2690&partnerID=40&md5=9f78ad9987d9b41fe1c7a546bb85dcd6,"The objective of this paper is to perform a time series econometric analysis in order to empirically assess the macroeconomic determinants and the corresponding drivers of Portuguese households' indebtedness in the period 1988 to 2016. During that period, the Portuguese economy experienced a process of financialisation that contributed to an increase in Portuguese households' indebtedness to unprecedented levels. The Portuguese households' indebtedness played a crucial role in the recent sovereign debt crisis. Based on the existing literature, we hypothesise that Portuguese households' indebtedness was due to seven macroeconomic determinants, notably housing prices, financial asset prices, the degree of personal income inequality, households' labour income, the importance of welfare state expenditures, the fraction of the working-age population and the level of interest rates. Our findings reveal that the housing prices busts, financial asset prices, the degree of personal income inequality, households' labour income and the fraction of the working-age population positively impact Portuguese households' indebtedness. Our findings also show that the increase in financial asset prices and the decline in housing prices were the main drivers of Portuguese households' indebtedness in the last few decades. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",financialisation; households' indebtedness; nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag estimator; Portugal; time series,Portugal; financial crisis; household expenditure; housing market; income distribution; interest rate; macroeconomics; time series analysis; welfare economics

Volatility spillovers during normal and high volatility states and their driving factors: A cross-country and cross-asset analysis,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148367510&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2717&partnerID=40&md5=4dd6cbb327a9b3764d09920d0c58b9a5,"Understanding the transmission of volatility across markets is essential for managing risk and financial stability, especially under crisis periods during which an extreme event occurring in one market is easily transmitted to another market. To gain such an understanding and enrich the related literature, we examine in this article the system of volatility spillovers across various equity markets and asset classes using a quantile-based approach, allowing us to capture spillovers under normal and high volatility states. The sample period is 16 March 2011–10 November 2020 and the employed dataset comprises 12 implied volatility indices representing a forward-looking measure of uncertainty of global equities, strategic commodities and the US Treasury bond market. The results show that the identity of transmitters and receivers of volatility shocks differ between normal and high volatility states. The US stock market is at the centre of volatility spillovers in the normal volatility state. European and Chinese stock markets and strategic commodities (e.g. crude oil and gold) become major volatility transmitters in the high volatility state, after acting as volatility receivers during normal periods. Furthermore, we study the drivers of implied volatility spillovers using regression models and find that US Default spread contributes to the total volatility spillover index in both volatility states, whereas TED spread plays a significant role in the normal volatility state. As for the role of short rate and risk aversion, it is significant in the high volatility state.

This paper draws on a panel of business enterprises operating in 33 industries in Japan to examine how research and development (R&D) activities affect employment. Our findings suggest that employment gains are associated with innovation, both at the aggregate level and within groups of major industries. The positive impact of technological advancement is more pronounced in the manufacturing sector. The results reveal heterogeneous patterns of the key determinants of employment growth based on the level of industries' routine intensity, but they accord well with the compensation theory concerning the connection between innovation and job creation. These results will be of interest for policymakers to design targeted economic strategies by supporting technological development in Japan and could also serve as a compass for other countries with similar workforce structures and macroeconomic characteristics. © 2022 The Authors.

We test this hypothesis for the UK housing sector using a long quarterly data (1973Q1-2015Q4) and employing Markov Switching Vector Auto Regression (MSVAR) models. Our results show that the magnitude of the bank lending channel is contingent upon the state of the economy, with a one standard deviation expansionary monetary policy shock producing a significant effect only in normal economic times. Further study on whether large cuts in policy rates could stimulate mortgage lending and whether there is impact asymmetry to dissimilar expansionary monetary policy shocks during financial crisis, we show that a sharp cut in policy rate indeed stimulates the BLC greater compared to smaller expansionary money policy shocks during recessions. © 2022 The Authors.

Does greater financial openness promote external competitiveness in emerging markets? The role of institutional quality,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137597767&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2695&partnerID=40&md5=18b3ddd2189301d539218835ba791812,"Studies have shown that external capital account liberalisation can boost capital inflows and augment economic development. Nevertheless, in the case of developing and emerging economies (DEE), adverse currency fluctuations could hamper external competitiveness due to relative price differences creating currency overvaluation, which might not be mitigated via financial openness alone. Therefore, this paper uses annual panel data for 35 DEEs over 40 years to explore whether financial openness of countries can help preserve their external price competitiveness, in the presence of greater trade openness and better institutional quality. Our findings suggest that financial openness alone does not aid export competitiveness, unless it is supported by greater trade openness. In addition, both cross country and regional analyses show that financial openness can benefit economies in maintaining their export competitiveness if they have stronger quality of institutions. Our results remain robust when we estimate the role of financial openness and institutional quality jointly on external competitiveness across regions, and during the pre- and post-crisis periods. We conclude that financial openness alone is not sufficient to improve external competitiveness of an emerging economy, but it does help in the presence of greater trade openness or better institutions, enabling reduction in trade costs and thereby making these countries more price-competitive. © 2022 The Authors.

Specifically, global policy risk has sharply increased due to policy uncertainty in major countries in the recent decade as are shown in the Brexit, the US-China trade friction and the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper empirically investigates effects of both global policy risk and global financial risk on macroeconomy and financial markets in eight major countries from January 1997 to June 2020. We employed a structural vector autoregressive framework to obtain interesting empirical results. First, global risks have recessionary effects on the macroeconomy, reducing production, deteriorating employment, lowering long-term interest rates, depressing prices and reducing global trade. Second, global risks also have recessionary effects on financial markets, plunging stock prices, appreciating the safe-haven currencies and depreciating the other currencies. Third, the macroeconomies and the financial markets respond to the global financial risk more significantly than the global policy risk. Fourth, the recessionary effects of global risks vary depending on countries. © 2022 The Authors.

We use the cross-sectional absolute deviation (CSAD) of returns and find that investors' mood during Islamic events of Eid-ul-Fitr, Eid-ul-Adha and Ashoura significantly affects herding behaviour in the market. Our results, however, contrast with existing evidence of herding in the month of Ramadan. Overall, results are robust after controlling for market conditions (i.e., domestic and US market returns, liquidity, sentiments, and oil price volatility) and crisis events (i.e., global financial crisis and Arab Spring).

"Stock returns, government response strategies, and daily new case bursts during COVID-19: A cross-country perspective",2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139054740&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2694&partnerID=40&md5=621cc94dc347a434d41464160ff5b76b,"The purpose of the current research is to examine the influence of COVID-19 pandemic related governmental policies and the bursts (e.g., drastic increases in cases during certain periods) of COVID-19 cases on the abnormal returns of 725 hospitality and entertainment companies from the United States (US), China, the United Kingdom (UK), India, Thailand, Turkey, Mexico, and France. The study uses daily data from January 1, 2020, to November 20, 2021 and event study methodology. Our results offer the following insights. First, the response in the early days of COVID-19 was negative for both the hospitality and entertainment sectors. Second, regarding government response strategies: (1) announcements of stimulus packages negatively affected China's entertainment and the UK's hospitality and entertainment sectors, but positively impacted the US's hospitality sector; (2) lockdown announcements adversely affected abnormal returns only in the US's hospitality and entertainment sectors; and (3) travel restrictions affected the US hospitality and Chinese and Indian entertainment sectors in the early stages of the pandemic. Third, regarding COVID-19 case bursts, the results showed more negative abnormal returns during the first burst in the developed countries compared to undeveloped countries, while in the second burst, investors reacted more rationally, resulting in less negative abnormal returns. Conversely, more negative abnormal returns were found in the second bursts in India and Turkey. We conclude that COVID-19's impact differed between developed and developing countries. Our findings suggest that investors should consider these differential effects when devising their portfolio strategies during COVID-19 or the similar situations. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",abnormal returns; bursts; COVID-19; event study; pandemic; stock returns,China; France; India; Mexico [North America]; Thailand; Turkey; United Kingdom; United States; COVID-19; economic activity; epidemic; financial crisis; financial market; stock market; strategic approach
The oil price plummeted in 2014–2015: Is there an effect on Chinese firms' labour investment?,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140234360&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2715&partnerID=40&md5=c4569a88ef6ec16092afe2b20560d95f,"Using the exogenous event of oil price sharp decline in 2014–2015, this paper employs the difference-in-difference method to establish a causal link between the oil price decline and the Chinese firms' labour investment. Data of listed companies in China from 2012 to 2016 are used to explore this relationship. We show that the employment for firms in industries with significant negative oil price risk exposure increases 16.4% after the oil price plummeted, that is, the oil price decline significantly promotes the firms' labour force. Additionally, the positive effect of oil price decline on the firms' labour force is more pronounced in firms with higher risk-taking, financing constraints, and industry competition. Lastly, we also document that the effect of oil price decline is through sales growth channels to increase labour demand. However, firms tend to overinvest in labour after the oil price plummeted. Based on these findings we suggest that oil price fluctuation should be an important factor for the Chinese government and enterprises when they make an economic decision related to the labour force. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",causal effect; DID method; labour investment; oil price decline; oil price risk exposure,China; competition (economics); investment; labor market; oil; price dynamics

Data for the analysis was drawn from two waves of the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. The results of median regression show that, with the exception of credit for consolidation of other debts, remaining credit purposes were associated with lower interest rates compared to the interest rates of credit for car purchases. Especially low interest rates were evidenced for educational debt. Quantile regression analysis has shown that households which, given their socioeconomic background, experienced the highest interest rate costs, paid additional premiums if their debt was related to consolidation of previous debts or consumption. In the case of households paying relatively low premiums, consolidation of other debts and consumption motives were associated with lower interest rates than loans devoted to car purchase. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",credit purpose; Household Finance and Consumption Survey; interest rates; non-mortgage loans,Europe; consumption behavior; credit provision; financial market; financial system; household expenditure; interest rate
Global growth on life support?

Using a model with a hierarchical structure, we capture the variability of GDP response to policy shocks both between and within the groups of advanced and emerging countries. Our results show that the effects of fiscal stimulus are higher in advanced economies compared to emerging markets, while monetary policy is found to have more homogeneous effects on GDP. We quantify the policy contribution on GDP growth in the decade that followed the global financial crisis by means of a structural counterfactual analysis based on conditional forecasts. We find that global GDP growth benefited from substantial policy support during the global financial crisis but policy tightening thereafter, particularly fiscal consolidation, acted as a significant drag on the subsequent global recovery. In addition, we show that the role of policy has differed across countries. Specifically, in advanced economies, highly accommodative monetary policy has been counteracted by strong fiscal consolidation. By contrast, in emerging economies, monetary policy has been less accommodative since the global recession. © 2022 The Authors.

Exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices in India – nonlinear evidence from a smooth transition model,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139507594&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2714&partnerID=40&md5=146c17975cc5bdb2e87a71519e99a64a,"Using a backward-looking Philips curve framework and a Logistic Smooth Transition Regression (STR) model, this article examined the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to final consumer prices in the case of India. Specifically, the nonlinearity of ERPT has been investigated with respect to the level of economic activity and the rate of inflation by considering two alternative measures of exchange rate. For the first transition variable, results are markedly different between high and low-activity regimes and signify the favourable impact of economic activity on the extent of pass-through. In the short run, 1% exchange rate appreciation would decrease the price level by 0.244% when the economy is in a low-activity regime; however, the same appreciation increases the price level by 0.485% when there is a boom in the economy. In the long run, ERPT in the low-activity regime is −0.358, and in the high-activity regime, it is 0.039. In both regimes, pass-through coefficients differ from zero and one, implying that neither local currency pricing nor producer currency pricing characterizes the ERPT mechanism. The impact of other important determinants of inflation is also well according to theoretical expectations. Finally, for the rate of inflation, we did not report any evidence favouring the Taylor hypothesis in the case of India. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",exchange rate; India; nonlinearity; smooth transition regression; Taylor hypothesis,India; consumption behavior; economic activity; exchange rate; price determination; price dynamics; regression analysis

How different are Monetary Unions to national economies according to prices?,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139008276&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2704&partnerID=40&md5=b600df6b65c936a436efc640c1d7bfb7,"Not that different. Based on a unique dataset of semi-annual microeconomic price levels of goods and services across and within countries for 1990:1–2018:2, we show that time-series volatility and cross-sectional dispersion of law-of-one-price deviations are similar for pairs of cities within the same country and across the Eurozone eleven original members. Our empirical analysis reveals that inflation and nominal exchange rate volatility/dispersion across locations have a positive impact on the volatility/dispersion across locations of law-of-one-price deviations across the globe. Furthermore, dispersion of law-of-one-price deviations across goods falls when the relative inflation rate between these locations rises, suggesting that the degree of price adjustment in individual product markets within a country has an international component shaped by international trade and arbitrage considerations. According to this measure of price integration, economies within the monetary union are half-way to the level of integration characterizing national economies. Moreover, monetary union membership is associated with lower volatility of law-of-one-price deviations, placing member countries more than half-way towards the volatility levels characterizing national economies. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Euro; inflation; law-of-one-price; nominal exchange rates; price dispersion; volatility,exchange rate; inflation; international trade; microeconomics; monetary union; national economy; price dynamics

Using Chinese firm-level data, we find that when expansionary monetary shock hits the economy, less productive firms are more responsive than productive firms in terms of resource accumulation. We identify two mechanisms for this effect. First, less productive firms accumulate net worth more slowly. They have higher leverage ratio and are more sensitive to monetary policy changes (the intensive margin). Second, monetary expansion relaxes borrowing constraints, which enables unproductive firms to survive. The congestion effect prevents resources from allocating to more productive firms. Our finding is robust even if we use private firm subsamples or avoid the massive fiscal stimulus in China around 2009. We provide a simple model of firm dynamics to capture these effects. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",extensive margin; intensive margin; leverage ratio; monetary policy; resource reallocation; total factor productivity,China; monetary policy; numerical model; policy reform; resource allocation; total factor productivity
Financial inclusion and economic growth: What roles do institutions and financial regulation play?,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143914601&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2709&partnerID=40&md5=ef965a301f62a273fd11458a3f1187b9,"The extant literature indicates that financial inclusion has a direct influence on economic growth. This has been examined by previous studies by analysing the link between financial inclusion and economic growth. This study uses the two-step system GMM approach to investigate the moderating role of financial regulation and quality of institutions on the linkage between economic growth and financial inclusion in Africa, using balanced panel data of 52 African countries spanning 2002–2019. The findings reveal a number of things; (i) financial inclusion, financial regulation, and all proxies of institutional quality exert strong and significant effects on economic growth; (ii) institutional quality enhances the impact of financial inclusion on economic growth; iii. Financial regulation dampens the effect of financial inclusion on economic growth. Based on these findings, we recommend the following; (i) central, local governments, and policymakers should formulate public policy that promotes inclusive finance. Such policies should aim at removing barriers and constraints such as excessive customer identification requirements that hinder people from gaining access to finance; (ii) central governments and policymakers in Africa should refine policy that promotes the involvement of the citizenry in governance processes, promote accountability of public institutions, ensure effective governance systems, controls corruption, promote rule of law, and political stability and ensure quality legal and regulatory regimes; (iii) African central governments should fine-tune policy aimed at strengthening institutions and the regulatory framework.

The non-linear impacts of innovation on unemployment: Evidence from panel data,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137544412&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2691&partnerID=40&md5=38c4b3b0b66427cc8454d3a1bdeb1fe3,"This article examines the linear and non-linear impacts of innovation on unemployment in 61 countries, covering annual data from 2007 to 2016. The relationship is estimated by deploying the system generalised method of moments (SGMM) estimation. Alternative instruments for the SGMM estimation and cross-sectional threshold estimation are utilised to investigate the estimation robustness. Although the negative linear relationship between innovation and unemployment is not robustly supported in the linear models, the empirical results of non-linear models suggest the existence of an inverted-U effect of innovation on unemployment rate. The marginal impact of innovation also supports the inverted-U relationship in which only the innovation at the maximum and mean level contributes to lower unemployment. Additionally, the negative marginal effect is larger at the maximum level compared to the mean level. The robustness estimations that use alternative instruments and the Hansen threshold regression also support the non-linear relationship. On the basis of the findings, although innovation should be encouraged to create more jobs, policymakers are advised to consider interventions in job protection, such as offering reskilling programs to mitigate rising unemployment following the initial efforts to promote innovation. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Hansen threshold regression; innovation; non-linear; system generalised method of moments estimation; unemployment,estimation method; innovation; nonlinearity; panel data; unemployment
The weakest links in the crisis of the Spanish Savings Banks,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139037234&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2702&partnerID=40&md5=977466be2bed4ec39c8240d272619db3,The bail-out of the Spanish financial system was the largest in the Eurozone. The Spanish savings banks were the main direct recipients of public support between 2010 and 2012 and most of the bail-out money was transferred to the savings banks after a series of mergers and acquisitions were completed among these entities. This article analyses the evolution of the savings banks in the years of economic growth preceding the crisis and their performance in the early aftermath of the 2007 crash using previously unexplored data from the annual financial statements of the 45 savings banks. We conclude it is possible to observe distinct behaviours among the savings banks during the boom years and we estimate the largest part of the bail-out money corresponds to losses registered by a small number of savings banks that were already severely impaired before the merger process got under way. © 2022 The Authors.

How the information content of integrated reporting flows into the stock market,2024,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140209507&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2721&partnerID=40&md5=e4b50a1e0cae9091b9f384bd6cc9f28e,"According to its advocates, integrated reporting (IR) aims to enhance firms' information environment by placing financial reporting into a much broader perspective in which interrelated non-financial information of firms' activities are taken into consideration. We examine whether this intended outcome of IR embeds into the stock pricing process using a sample of South African listed firms that mandatorily adopted IR in 2011. Unlike previous studies that explore market valuation implications of IR, we examine the channel through which the IR-related information flows into firm value. Specifically, we quantify the effects of revisions of expectation about future cash flows (prompted by financial reporting information), revisions of expectation about discount rates (prompted by non-financial reporting information) and their interconnectedness. We hypothesize and empirically show that the adoption of an IR approach prompted greater market revisions of expectations about future discount rates and a stronger interconnectedness between market revisions of expectations about future cash flows and discount rates. Thus, the change in the stock pricing process after the adoption of IR is determined by non-financial reporting information and its strong interconnectedness with financial reporting information. We also show that our results are stronger for firms with greater earnings opacity, suggesting that investors find IR more useful when firms' financial reporting is opaque. Results indicate to researchers, practitioners and regulators that IR enhances the firm-level information environment by providing informative non-financial reporting which is also well integrated with financial reporting. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",discount rate news; integrated reporting; pricing process; South Africa,South Africa; discount rate; finance; price dynamics; stock market

To achieve this, we carried out a cross-quantile analysis in the static and dynamic frameworks, using the bi-variate cross-quantilogram (CQ) and the partial cross-quantilogram (PCQ) approaches and a dynamic variant of such approaches. The predictability of the stock returns on the energy prices for WTI, Brent, OPEC, heating oil and natural gas is examined. Further relationships are also conditioned by using two measures of geopolitical risk, including the general geopolitical risk (GPRD), and the geopolitical risk threats (GPRD_Threat). The overall results highlight the importance of employing the PCQ approach in examining the predictability of different pairs of the energy prices, exchange rates and stock markets.

Applying the two-step generalized methods of moments, we found a non-linear and inverted U-shaped relationship between working capital finance (WCF) and firm performance, significantly influenced by the macroeconomic indicators that is, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, Inflation rate, and interest rate. We segregated the data regarding the global financial recession period 2008–2010 and disclosed that the non-linear and inverted U-shaped relationship between WCF and firm performance turns to linear and negative during this recession period. We also evaluated the role of GDP growth, inflation, and interest rate in WCF and firm performance relationship during the global recession and found that these factors do not influence the nexus during this period. Firm managers, lending agencies, and researchers may use these results in choosing the best financing options in working capital under the changing situation of macroeconomic factors. The WCF and firm performance analysis during the global recession period (2008–2010) may be the best prediction model for the current financial crisis caused by COVID-19. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",firm performance; global recession; GMM; short-term debts; working capital finance,China; capital; economic instability; financial crisis; financial system; Gross Domestic Product; industrial performance; inflation; interest rate; macroeconomics
Corruption and foreign bank entry denials: A cross-country panel analysis,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134045268&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2667&partnerID=40&md5=33ca04e46e196ebca94755cfb6d4da31,"The existing literature largely reports a negative effect of corruption on foreign direct investment (FDI) and explains it by the unwillingness of foreign investors to invest due to the high post-entry costs and risks of corruption. However, in addition to affecting foreign investors' willingness to invest, corruption can also affect their ability to invest. This latter channel is less explored. To fill this gap, we use cross-country panel data to analyse the relationship between corruption and foreign bank entry denials. Our fixed-effects estimation results, as well as the following sensitivity checks show that corruption can also be an entry-point deterrent: corrupt host countries are more likely to deny entry to foreign banks. This finding suggests that at least some foreign investors are forced rather than choose to stay out of corrupt countries. A policy implication could be that reducing the entry-point corruption can increase foreign investment even if the post-entry costs and risks of corruption remain unchanged. © 2022 The Authors.

The asymmetric impact of oil price uncertainty on emerging market financial stress: A quantile regression approach,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131309480&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2651&partnerID=40&md5=aa2cd41c41c40aeb74a89ae6e40eaa2d,"This study investigates the effects of the crude oil implied volatility index (OVX) upon emerging market financial stress (EMFS). We resort to a quantile regression framework as this approach is a better alternative to disentangle the relationship under different market conditions. Besides, we also examine how EMFS responds to the lags and asymmetries in the OVX. The empirical results show significantly positive impacts of OVX upon EMFS. Further, the effects of OVX become more assertive in the upper quantiles of EMFS, implying higher sensitivity to OVX when stress levels are high. In terms of the lagged effects, the relationship is transient as the OVX coefficients become weaker with increasing lag sizes. We further find that only positive impulses in OVX can significantly predict EMFS. Lastly, we report evidence that the Credit market stress is a crucial driver of EMFS. © 2022 The Authors.

High frequency volatility forecasting: A new approach using a hybrid ANN-MC-GARCH model,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130474523&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2640&partnerID=40&md5=1d560f998c2d7a3db405e7562ec61aee,"Risk permeates more and more financial markets around the world. It is an essential element that all financial market actors attempt to model and manage. This paper proposes a novel model that improves the predictive accuracy of high frequency volatility forecasts. The ANN-MC-GARCH model is therefore developed in this research. The hybrid model enhances the MC-GARCH conditional variance model by including endogenous market variables in a feed forward network which models volatility in terms of past disturbances and variances. The forecasting accuracy of the novel ANN-MC-GARCH is evaluated against the classical MC-GARCH model. The empirical investigation employs the 1-min high frequency observations of four exchange rates (USD/EUR, USD/GBP, USD/JPY & AUD/JPY), three market indices (France 40, UK 100 & USA 500) and two metal commodity indices (Spot Gold & Spot Silver). The backtesting method employs the RMSE and MAE performance metrics, the out-of-sample (Figure presented.), the Diebold-Mariano test and the Model Confidence Set (MCS) procedure. The empirical findings show that the hybrid model is superior to the MC-GARCH model for the nine datasets. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",artificial neural network; high frequency; hybrid ANN-MC-GARCH; MC-GARCH; volatility forecasts,accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; commodity market; empirical analysis; exchange rate; forecasting method; metal; numerical model
Effects of monetary policy on the skill premium and the growth rate in a directed technical change model with heterogeneous cash-in-advance constraints,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129364155&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2633&partnerID=40&md5=bb26697a43f7b795b6aef5417369f883,"This article analyses the balanced-growth-path effects of monetary policy (inflation) on the skill premium and the growth rate in the context of a directed technical change model with cash-in-advance (CIA) constraints specific to the unskilled and skilled sectors. Calibrating the model using data from 36 countries, the presence of more stringent CIA constraints in the unskilled sector, as supported by the literature, causes inflation to have a positive effect on the skill premium. Moreover, it also increases the negative impact of inflation on the growth rate in relation to the baseline scenario of homogeneous CIA constraints. A lower labour share and higher inflation in general magnify these effects on both variables while a relative lower importance of the unskilled sector does the opposite with respect to the skill premium. Therefore this article innovates in three important ways: (i) we add an additional channel through which inflation affects inequality; (ii) we highlight the importance of avoiding ignoring differences of liquidity constraints across the economy in the context of endogenous growth models to not underestimate the negative long-run impacts of inflation; (iii) the results suggest that developing countries that have difficulty in achieving price stability in the long-run can mitigate the negative effects of inflation by reducing constraints faced by the unskilled sector and promoting the development of the skilled sector. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",CIA constraints; directed technical change; endogenous growth; inflation; skill premium; technological-knowledge bias,developing world; endogenous growth; growth rate; inflation; knowledge; labor market; monetary policy; price dynamics; skilled labor; technical change
Does financial fraud affect implied cost of equity?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130620104&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2639&partnerID=40&md5=c5a3477d2cc2fbefdbf4fada06224e7e,"The paper examines the relationship between financial fraud and a firm's implied equity cost. Using a U.S. sample of 15,552 firm-year observations, we find a positive relationship between a firm's financial fraud and implied equity cost. Consistent with the monitoring channel, financial fraud increases a firm's equity cost in the presence of higher external and internal monitoring in terms of higher analyst coverage and institutional ownership. Our results are robust to alternate specifications and tests, including alternate definitions of equity cost, financial fraud, and other endogeneity concerns. The findings negate the business case of financial fraud by showing that financial fraud tends to enhance equity cost, thereby lowering the firm's value. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",analyst coverage; cost of equity; external monitoring; financial fraud; firm value; internal monitoring,United States; equity; financial market; financial system; firm ownership; industrial investment; institutional framework
Is there J-curve effect in the US Service Trade?

In testing the hypothesis, almost all previous studies used trade data in goods only. We add to this literature by considering the US trade in insurance and financial services with each of its nine trading partners. Using quarterly data over the period 2003Q1–2019Q4, when we estimated a linear model, we found limited support for the J-curve effect. However, when we estimated a nonlinear model to assess the possibility of asymmetric response of a service trade to exchange rate changes, we found much more support for the hypothesis. Precisely, we found support for the asymmetric J-curve in the US insurance (finance) trade with Australia, Belgium, France, and Korea (Australia, Germany) and asymmetric inverse J-curve in the US insurance (finance) trade with Germany, Italy, and United Kingdom (Belgium, Canada). © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",asymmetric analysis; nine partners; service trade; the J-curve effect; the United States,Australia; Belgium; Canada; France; Germany; Italy; Korea; United States; estimation method; financial services; insurance system; literature review; nonlinearity; trade flow; trade relations
Are European commercial banks more profitable than cooperative banks? Evidence from a low interest rate environment,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132559668&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2656&partnerID=40&md5=286f64add0125f97d60d1a51e9f76098,"Our aim is to compare empirically the profitability of European cooperative and commercial banks in a low interest rate environment. We employ dynamic panel data methods on a data set of nearly 1000 banks from 11 European countries where both ownership structures compete on the same market. We observed different banking strategies during the 2009–2015 period, when market interest rates reached an all-time low. Our analysis produced four main conclusions. First, we find that commercial banks maintain superior profitability over cooperative banks in an environment of low interest rates. Second, commercial banks unjustifiably decreased their loan loss provisioning in a low interest rate environment in order to maintain their profitability. This trend is not present in cooperative banks. Third, decreased provisioning is present mainly in smaller institutions. Fourth, cooperative banks are significantly more stable than commercial banks in terms of their Z-score in a low interest rate environment. This finding is in line with existing findings during normal interest rates. In addition, the Z-score of cooperative banks increased during the observation period, whereas the Z-score of commercial banks remained stable. Our findings survive a battery of robustness checks. Our results also show differences in the strategies and priorities of both competing ownership types in a low interest rate environment: commercial banks focus on maintaining their profitability by decreasing loan loss provisions, whereas cooperative banks seek to increase their stability. Therefore, regulators pursuing stability in a low interest rate environment should focus on the credit risk management of small commercial banks. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",commercial banks; cooperative banks; low interest rate environment; profitability; risk management; Z-score,Europe; banking; commercial activity; cooperative sector; credit provision; financial market; financial system; interest rate; lending behavior; profitability; risk assessment
Rural credit and agricultural production: Empirical evidence from Brazil,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130515542&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2648&partnerID=40&md5=43001cbf49abea0d7c465bb2e9d00a7d,"This article examines the long- and short-run effects of rural credit on the gross value added of agricultural output in Brazil. We apply the dynamic vector error correction model (VECM) to the estimation and testing. The main finding is that there is a positive long-run relationship between agricultural sector production and loans from financial institutions to the agricultural sector. The long-run elasticity estimated was 0.44, implying that an increase of 1% in rural credit leads to a 0.44% increase in the agricultural sector's GDP.

Overall, pass-through rate significantly affects both export and import prices. Contrary to the literature, pass-through is significantly higher for local currency-priced goods. The relative rate of pass-through to the U.S. dollar and euro-priced goods is determined by the type of products and value-added trade.

Within a Bayesian structural vector autoregression framework, central bank balance sheet, policy rate, demand, and supply shocks are identified using a combination of sign and zero restrictions. An expansionary balance sheet shock stimulates bank lending and M2, decreases interest rate spread, leads to a depreciation of the domestic currency, and increases output and consumer prices. The estimated output and consumer price effects are qualitatively similar to the effects of conventional monetary policy, while the impacts on the exchange rate and foreign exchange reserves are different. We also find favourable evidence for the delayed overshooting response of the exchange rate to the balance sheet shock and reveal that financial friction amplifies the effects of demand and supply shocks on the Mongolian economy. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Bayesian VARs; central bank balance sheet; Mongolia; structural shocks; transmission mechanism; unconventional monetary policy,Mongolia; Bayesian analysis; central bank; currency devaluation; currency market; exchange rate; export; financial system; lending behavior; macroeconomics; monetary policy; trade performance; vector autoregression
The influence of corporate governance and shareholding structure on corporate social responsibility: The key role of executive compensation,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133186612&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2663&partnerID=40&md5=ae168b4713e4f39a338ad565ca80e15c,"This paper aims to contribute to the extant literature on corporate social responsibility and corporate governance by empirically examining the effect of firm governance and shareholding structure (and their interaction) on corporate social responsibility performance. Our study is conducted within a unique context of improving social responsibility policies, regulations, and management. In particular, we examine how corporate governance practices and both outside (institutional and pension) and inside (managerial) shareholdings impact corporate social responsibility activities. Using one of the largest UK data sets to date, consisting of FTSE 350 nonfinancial listed firms for the period from 2002 to 2016, our results provide evidence that corporate governance has a positive impact on corporate social responsibility. Institutional (indicating strong monitoring role) and managerial (proxy for alignment of interests between insiders and outsiders) shareholdings are negatively associated with corporate social responsibility performance. Our additional analyses provide empirical evidence that compensation structure, as a corporate governance tool, aligns management decisions toward engaging in corporate social responsibility activities and corporate strategic sustainable objectives. Additionally, our results suggest a substitutive relationship of institutional shareholding with corporate governance practices. There is a complementary relationship of managerial shareholding with corporate governance practices in influencing corporate social responsibility. Our evidence is robust after controlling for entrenched managerial shareholding, 2SLS and alternative measures of corporate social responsibility performance. The findings provide empirical support for the UK Corporate Governance Code's emphasis on designing effective remuneration policies and practices. © 2022 The Authors.

Understanding its determinants is pivotal. While most studies emphasize real factors such as industrialization and education, they usually, with a few exceptions, overlook the financial sector channel of impact. To close the gap, the paper investigates the effect of banking development on fertility. Using panel time-series techniques to a panel of developed and developing countries, it finds that fertility rises with banking development but decreases with banking volatility. It also finds asymmetric responses of fertility to changes in banking development. Households tend to have more children when the banking sector is expanding but do not have less children when the banking sector is declining. The evidence holds for both bank credit to households and to firms. In addition, as additional sources of funds and investment opportunities, development in securities markets is found to raise fertility. Asymmetry is also detected with a larger fertility effect during market booms than busts. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",asymmetry; banking development; banking volatility; fertility; firm credit; household credit,asymmetry; banking; debt; economic development; fertility; panel data

Households' savings are diversified among bank deposits and stock purchases, and banks' lending to firms is subject to capital-related deviation costs. We find that households' participation in the stock market, coupled to the existence of a capital-constrained banking sector affects the transmission of monetary policy to the economy significantly, and that households' deposits act as a critical spill-over channel between the real and the financial sectors. Further, we relate the deviation costs in the banking sector with the degree of pass-through of monetary policy shocks.

By employing 23,999 firm-year observations between 2008 and 2018, we examine how local religious norms affect corporate cash policies. We provide strong evidence that religiosity significantly reduces the level of corporate cash holdings, by mitigating financial constraints and earnings management of the listed companies. Managers from religious areas make more effective investments and distribute more dividends. Furthermore, our findings document that religion has a more pronounced influence on cash holdings amongst the firms with the smaller size, lower leverage, higher marketization, effective internal control and facing fierce market competition.

The impact of R&D investment on grain crops production in China: Analysing the role of agricultural credit and CO2 emissions,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130340820&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2638&partnerID=40&md5=e6d93615ad2313e10f460da11c5f0b64,"A better understanding of the dynamics involved in grain production is critical for food security and poverty reduction. To this end, several factors influence grain production, including capital (i.e. R&D investment and agricultural credit), agriculture environment (i.e. CO2 emissions), and technical progress (i.e. fertilizers and agricultural machinery). This paper analyses the combined effects of these factors on China's grain crops output from 1990 to 2017 by using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach. The ARDL-bounds testing approach provided the long-run connection amid the variables. The findings include: (i) agricultural R&D spending has an encouraging and meaningful influence on grain crops yield in the long-run and short-run; (ii) agricultural credit significantly and positively stimulates grain crops output; (iii) CO2 emissions negatively impact grains' output in the short- and long-run; (iv) area under grain crops and fertilizers used also endure a positive spur on grain crops production in the long-run and short-run; and (v) short-run nexus among the variables is navigated for robustness rationale via the vector error correction model Granger causality practice.

Optimal hedging in the presence of internal flexibility,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133184742&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2664&partnerID=40&md5=95b489cc8e6a5b25ffb4b18e43a3b60c,"Internal flexibility aids in risk management and has a broader application than hedging instruments. This paper demonstrates how optimal hedging policies are affected by it. We develop a dynamic risk management model to capture financial and operational decisions. We first show that internal flexibility reduces the marginal value of hedging instruments. As a result, optimal financial hedging is selective and dependent on investment opportunities. These opportunities account for the majority of the difference between hedged and unhedged firms. By incorporating internal flexibility, the model becomes more realistic but also generates a complex interaction between financial hedging and marketing strategy. During the growth phase, hedging instruments are partially substitutive but have a synergistic effect on investment. In the mature or declining phase, the remedial effect of marketing strategy maintains investment, thereby increasing operating risk and the marginal value of financial hedging. These results are applicable to firms free of agency conflicts and provide a solid theoretical basis for future empirical tests. We advise that scholars thoroughly examine internal flexibility and development stages in the process. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",hedging instrument; integrated risk management; interaction effect; internal flexibility,decision making; financial market; financial policy; financial system; future prospect; marketing; model test; risk assessment; theoretical study
Greek government-debt crisis events and European financial markets: News surprises on Greek bond yields and inter-relations of European financial markets,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130302323&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2634&partnerID=40&md5=7ec306b026733e9b8b727923e0160cf9,"We study the impact of Greek government-debt crisis events on inter-relations of European financial markets during the European sovereign debt crisis. To this end, we examine the effects of three categories of Greek government-debt crisis events in the realized correlations and correlation jumps of government bonds, CDS, and stock indices of seven European countries (i.e., France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) via the respective dummy variables and news surprises on 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year government bonds and CDS in a non-parametric framework by employing Tobit regression models. According to the results, the direction of most impacts on correlations and correlation jumps is negative, suggesting that the Greek government-debt crisis events reduced the homogeneity among member states in the Eurozone. We also investigate the types of Greek government-debt crisis events that have the highest impacts on correlations and correlation jumps and find that the highest impacts mainly result from news originating from Greek and European sources. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",contagion; correlation jumps; Greek debt crisis; realized correlation,France; Germany; Greece; Ireland; Italy; Portugal; Spain; correlation; debt crisis; financial market; government
Banking performance and institutional quality: Evidence from dynamic panel data analysis,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134766027&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2673&partnerID=40&md5=f2d24c9b725529e1a63934e5813b7bd0,"This study aims to pioneer in investigating the role of two major components of governance (i.e., corruption and political stability) in banking performance in the case of 21 emerging countries. Using time-series data from 2010 to 2017 with annual frequency, this study uses a comprehensive measure that assesses banking performance called capital-adequacy, asset-quality, management-efficiency, earnings and liquidity (CAMEL). However, for empirical analysis, this study utilises the dynamic panel data modelling technique, that is, System-GMM and Pooled-OLS and margins plot, for robust and policy-oriented outcomes. We find that higher corruption and political instability negatively affect asset quality, earnings, and management efficiency and positively affect the banks' liquidity. More interestingly, higher corruption is more harmful than lower political stability. It negatively affects the banking performance directly and intensifies the impact of the lower stability on banking performance. This study has implications for regulators, bankers, and investors. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",banking performance; CAMEL; corruption; political stability; system GMM,banking; financial market; financial services; governance approach; institutional framework; investment; panel data

We find that the overall finance–growth nexus is positive, yet its effect size differs across regions. Indeed, finance has a larger growth-enhancing effect in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region than in the Middle East and North Africa region. This finding is supported by meta-regression analysis that controls for various study conditions simultaneously.

We examine the effect of the volatility of earnings per share (EPS) and of total shareholder returns (TSR) on the choice of performance measures, taking into account four categories of measure: EPS alone, TSR alone, EPS and TSR jointly, or neither EPS nor TSR. This allows us to utilize a comprehensive cross-section of plans. The results are robust to controlling for plan types, the use of different compensation consultants, industry and time-specific effects. We find that “EPS and TSR jointly” is the most common category of performance measure employed by firms. Our empirical results show that firms with higher EPS volatility and lower TSR volatility are more likely to choose TSR as a performance measure and that firms with higher EPS volatility are less likely to choose EPS alone; we argue that these results are consistent with optimal contracting theory. Second, we conduct a novel, detailed description of the performance measures, comparator groups, plan choices, threshold targets and vesting levels at minimum and maximum thresholds, used in CEO compensation contracts. We further argue that commonalities across firms in the elements of target-setting are evidence of institutional isomorphism. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",CEO compensation contracts; corporate governance; long-term incentive plans; optimal contracting; performance target,United Kingdom; compensation system; empirical analysis; financial services; governance approach; incentive; institutional framework
Forecasting equity risk premium: A new method based on wavelet de-noising,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131185007&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2653&partnerID=40&md5=298520a9cf6b5ac1f817e1674d151bd4,"Forecasting equity risk premium is notoriously difficult due to a mass of data noise in the raw series and the absence of clear tendency. Using the monthly S&P 500 excess returns from 1927:01 to 2018:12, we first de-noise the in-sample original returns series via wavelet method to capture the basic trend of equity risk premium, and then propose forecasting models to obtain one-step forward out-of-sample predicted values based on the de-noised returns. Our new models can provide substantially superior out-of-sample performance compared with other competing models and the historical average. Sizeable economic gains can be realized by a mean–variance investor if they allocate their asset through the new approach.

Uncertainties and green bond markets: Evidence from tail dependence,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132435777&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2659&partnerID=40&md5=ab16f63460078472b1183f34ab6a9192,"Motivated by a lack of studies related to macro risk-driven green bond markets, this paper detects the tail dependence of the USA and China green bond markets on three uncertainty indicators. We applied a novel cross-quantilogram method to address this issue and utilised the quantile causality test for robustness, as well as to capture predictive causalities. The results show that three selected uncertainty indicators are important drivers for the returns and volatilities of green bond markets. However, all three indicators play different roles in the two nations. The most influential determinant of US green bonds is financial uncertainty, whereas in China, it is economic policy uncertainty. Additionally, the impact on green bond returns varies in different market states, and green bond volatilities may respond abnormally to extreme increasing changes in these uncertainties. These findings imply the unique financial characteristics of two green bond markets and heterogeneities between different countries. The corresponding investment implications and policy significance are discussed in detail in the concluding section. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",green bonds; quantile; risk management; uncertainties; USA and China,China; United States; economic policy; environmental economics; green economy; investment; market conditions; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis

In addition, we propose three specific influence mechanisms for the renewable energy industry. The results of our mechanism analysis show that the uncertainty of oil price will increase the market's expectation of renewable energy enterprises and thus stimulate their investment. While the uncertainty of oil price will restrain the investment expenditure of renewable energy enterprises through risk transmission. The scale of enterprises will affect the above two influencing mechanisms. However, the uncertainty of oil price can hardly influence the strategic investment decision through the stimulation of the renewable energy industry by the consumer market.

Macro-management policies: A supporting role to company' capital expenditure,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129265314&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2623&partnerID=40&md5=2024d571158b60e1e259d37eea23bb1b,"This article studies the empirical impact of Foreign Assets Management (FAM) on companies' capital expenditure in emerging market economies with International Financial Shocks (IFS). The empirical analysis uses annual data of 2931 publicly listed companies in 45 emerging market economies from 2000 to 2019. We analyzed a multiplicative regression of a canonical capital expenditure Q model. The findings show that FAM positively affects companies' capital expenditure. Moreover, financially restricted companies are more sensitive to the favourable impact of FAM compared to restricted companies. Our results highlight the relevance of considering companies' heterogeneity when examining the effect of macro-management policies. In addition, FAM has a more favourable impact on companies' capital expenditure in economies that concurrently use capital controls and macroprudential policy. Finally, our findings suggest that successful macro-management policies insulate capital expenditure from adverse IFS. This result highlights the role of more coordinated approaches to repel adverse international shocks. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",capital controls; capital expenditure; foreign assets policy; international financial shocks; macroprudential policy,capital flow; capital market; financial policy; financial services; macroeconomics; public spending; regression analysis
Foreign exchange market asymmetries in Pacific small island developing states: Evidence from Fiji,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131758378&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2654&partnerID=40&md5=2f74b808209b441c2ed809982d9471df,"After abandoning Bretton Wood, the foreign exchange market has been dominated by three types of economies: export-oriented economies (China and other Asian countries), commodity economies (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and oil exporting nations) and reserve-currency economies (US, EU, UK, and Swiss). As a result, the asymmetric development of the foreign exchange market has reduced the monetary and fiscal space for PSIDS, which face structural challenges such as a low population base, import dependence, aid dependency, climate risk, and political uncertainty. The ‘Exchange Market Pressure Index’ (EMPI) for Fiji is developed in this article to quantify the pressure on the exchange rate and monetary authorities' responses to micromanaging balance sheet impacts. The calculated EMPI accurately reflects four instances of financial distress in Fiji, including significant exchange market pressure in response to growing trade deficits and external debt, the global financial crisis's contagion effect, and political uncertainty. Our EMP Index's robustness is attributed in part to the employment of a dynamic time series estimate method, a time-varying weighing scheme, and a high-frequency monthly dataset. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",exchange market pressure; exchange rate and foreign exchange market; Fiji; macro-financial risk analysis; Pacific small island developing states (PSIDS),Fiji; commodity market; currency; debt; exchange rate; export; financial crisis; financial market; risk assessment; small island state; trade flow
Playing by the rules: Do the post-crisis regulations influence banks' funding model in the EU?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133374844&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2665&partnerID=40&md5=14f40e788fb0b0570779f23daeab9477,"In the article, we assess the impact of the regulatory framework on banks' funding models in the European Union in the period 2011–2018. We put particular emphasis on the capital requirements captured by two different types of regulatory measures: individual and sectoral. Moreover, we include a country-level regulatory variable to assess if the overall lawmaking conditions impact banks' funding models. Our estimates indicate that after the Global Financial Crisis, all regulatory measures had a significant impact on the deposits to total assets ratio, which we assume to be the best proxy for banks' funding models. Having divided the sample of the EU banks into four subsamples according to their specialization (i.e. commercial, cooperative, savings, and investment banks), we identified significant differences in strength and direction of regulatory variables' impact on banks' funding model within selected subsamples. In particular, due to the specific nature of investment banks, prudential regulations contribute to a change in the funding model towards safer deposit funding. Moreover, our results indicate that in the case of the non-euro area banking sector, the regulatory environment measured by the regulatory quality index has an adverse impact on the Deposits to total assets ratio in comparison with both the entire sample as well as the euro area banking sector. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",banks' capital regulations; banks' funding structure; deposits; European Union; global financial crisis,Europe; banking; capital market; European Union; financial crisis; financial market; regulatory framework
Basel accords and banking inefficiency: Evidence from the Italian local market,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130955988&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2637&partnerID=40&md5=fd0d9c96bf83f77461b1d27afc10eb19,"Using data for Italy from 1994 to 2015, we appraise the nexus between Basel II and III accords and both the cost and the profit inefficiency of profit-oriented and mutual cooperative banks. Our analysis further deals with the effects of the regulation in different market structures. To assess the efficiency of the two types of banks under scrutiny, a stochastic frontier approach has been proposed. The evidence reported in this paper indicates that the regulatory framework of the Basel accords had heterogeneous effects on the efficiency of Italian banking institutions. Specifically, Basel II is associated with a contraction in the profit inefficiency and an increase in the cost inefficiency for mutual cooperative banks. On the other hand, Basel III worsened the profit inefficiency, though it is found to reduce the profit inefficiency of mutual cooperative banks, with no significant impact on cost inefficiency. Furthermore, once we control for the degree of market competition, the effects of the regulation are shown to be statistically insignificant. The advent of the 2008 recession and the application of the revenue inefficiency do not alter the main findings. There is also some evidence of spatial effects of the Basel II regulation at the LMA level. © 2022 The Authors.

Zombie enterprises damage the fair position of market players and cause irreparable damage to the market mechanism, with efficiency as the core. This study chooses factor productivity as the starting point and uses the financial data of listed manufacturing companies from 2008 to 2016 as the sample to explore and evaluate the damage of zombie enterprises to the production efficiency of the Chinese market. The main contributions of this study are as follows. First, zombie enterprises in listed companies are identified by a comprehensive identification method. Second, the growth rate of the total factor productivity of non-zombie enterprises is measured by the DEA Malmquist index method, the crowding-out effect of zombie enterprises on TFP growth of normal enterprises is studied, and the specific transmission path is analysed. The empirical results show that zombie enterprises have a significant inhibitory effect on the total factor productivity growth of non-zombie enterprises, verifying our conjecture at the macro level. Finally, on the basis of theoretical and empirical analyses, this paper puts forward some policy suggestions to help zombie enterprises clear up to promote the growth of total factor productivity of non-zombie enterprises and the healthy development of the entire industry. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",crowding out effect; enterprise efficiency; Malmquist index; mechanism test; TFP; zombie enterprises,China; empirical analysis; growth rate; industrial production; manufacturing; total factor productivity
The moderating effects of CEO power and personal traits on say-on-pay effectiveness: Insights from the Anglo-Saxon economies,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132614318&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2636&partnerID=40&md5=4113d2d814fad208d38ce3ac8f6d4df7,"This study investigates the efficacy of say-on-pay (SOP) regulation in mitigating excessive CEO compensation and how it is affected by CEO personal traits and the power distribution inside a corporation. Using IV-GMM method and a sample of 1,931 firms from Australia, Canada, the UK, and the USA, we find that shareholder voices are successful in reducing the pay gap between CEOs and the median employee, regardless of the exact nature of the regulation. In addition, older CEOs are associated with lower pay ratios and there are some evidences suggesting that older or female CEOs enhance SOP effectiveness. Further, power distribution manifested through corporate governance mechanisms matters, as increasing board size and director and audit committee independence reduce pay ratio. A measure of CEO power, CEO pay slice, has a significant and large positive explanatory power for the model and its exclusion can greatly exaggerate the estimated impact of SOP on pay ratio. Another measure of CEO power, CEO duality, appears to enhance the potency of SOP slightly. There is also some evidence indicating that ownership concentration enhances SOP effectiveness.

Less-informed traders trade-off between a diversification effect induced by risk-averse attitude and a “flight-to-quality” effect by their aversion towards correlation ambiguity. In equilibrium, the magnitudes between equilibrium positions of different traders are affected by the true correlation coefficient, the upper-bound correlation conceived by naive traders and the quality of risky assets simultaneously.

Are lower interest rates really associated with higher growth? New empirical evidence on the interest rate thesis from 19 countries,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131154622&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2630&partnerID=40&md5=b5c8b58b57fbfd9f1d99e85c69c20ddb,"There is a substantial literature on the link between finance and growth. Empirical evidence remains inconclusive and the debate continues. In this paper, we adopt the research strategy of focusing on a narrower underlying issue that remains at the core of most macroeconomic theories, namely the interest rate thesis (that lower rates result in higher growth and vice versa). If there are problems with this relationship, this could explain the lack of consensus on the finance-growth nexus. The question is also of practical relevance: Central banks have been focusing on interest rate policy on the assumption that the interest rate thesis holds. There are theoretical reasons why this may not be the case. We conduct an analysis of time-varying dynamic conditional correlation in a GARCH model and of the direction of statistical causation between nominal interest rates and real economic activity in 19 industrialized and emerging economies. We find evidence that interest rates are not negatively correlated with economic growth and do not cause growth. Instead, we find evidence that the relationship may be the opposite in both dimensions. This adds to recent doubts about the prevailing conduct of monetary policy and common theoretical models. Specifically, lowering interest rates may be counter-productive when trying to stimulate the economy. © 2022 The Authors.

How do investors price accrual risk during crises?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135498690&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2671&partnerID=40&md5=ff7c118955c904486b95ccb32eb88ff0,"Under rational asset pricing theory, and in efficient, frictionless market, risk should be priced contemporaneously and, thus, the market meltdown during the COVID-19 pandemic must have been a contingent valuation of newly created risk. In contrast, we find that the reduction in equity value during the pandemic was stronger for stocks with higher pre-pandemic accrued risk. This lends support to the discrete pricing proposition, which is a form of behavioural bias where investors price accrued risk during significant corporate or macroeconomic events. Furthermore, we compare the pricing of accrued risk during the pandemic with the pricing of accrued risk during non-pandemic events and during past financial crises. We report evidence that pricing of accrued risk results in a premium in normal times and a discount during financial turmoil. Finally, we report evidence that investors price accrued stocks discriminately, that is, they are more likely to price accrued risk of stocks of larger firms, smaller B/M, and weaker momentum.

A disaggregated approach to analysing the effects of globalization and energy consumption on economic growth: New insights from low-income countries,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128979999&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2631&partnerID=40&md5=061a800032449fb35920a41a61a31a8a,"This study examines the impacts of globalization and energy consumption on economic growth in 10 low-income countries during the 1990–2017 period. It also determines the causal relationship between globalization and energy consumption. It disaggregates overall globalization into economic, social, and political dimensions, as well as disaggregates total energy consumption into renewable and non-renewable energy. It employs the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares, Instrumental Variables approach, and Dumitrescu-Hurlin Granger non-causality technique to account for heterogeneity, endogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. The results show that overall globalization has a positive impact on economic growth in low-income countries. But when it disaggregates globalization into economic, social and political dimensions, the results reveal that social and political dimensions boost economic growth while economic dimension undermines economic growth. Moreover, the results show that energy consumption is a significant determinant of economic growth. But when it disaggregates energy consumption into renewable and non-renewable energy, the results reveal that non-renewable energy consumption has a positive impact on economic growth, while the impact of renewable energy consumption is tenuous. The results also show a unidirectional causality from globalization to energy consumption, suggesting that globalization enhances energy consumption.

"Links between growth, trade and financial openness in South Africa: An empirical investigation",2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131194972&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2652&partnerID=40&md5=f332e7d98b155b16735b872a266cfaa4,"This study aims to confirm an empirical link between financial openness, foreign trade and income growth in South Africa. Although domestic credits, trade and growth are cointegrated, the findings indicate that no such link can be observed between money supply and exports as exports are a result of foreign demand and hence subject to foreign monetary factors rather than domestic financial development. The results of causality analyses reveal that the export-led and supply-leading hypotheses are confirmed for South Africa. Money supply in South Africa is also output driven. Finally, the study shows that changes in domestic credits precede significant changes in trade and growth in South Africa. As a result, this study suggests that the creation of domestic credits is a significant force behind trade and aggregate income in the region. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",bounds test; financial development; international trade; South Africa,South Africa; empirical analysis; financial market; growth rate; income; international trade; testing method; trade openness
"Corporate board and dynamics of capital structure: Evidence from UK, France and Germany",2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125407310&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2593&partnerID=40&md5=e07edfc8f4240b1db7b455bee68e2cc9,"Theoretical arguments suggest that capital structure will adjust to the dynamics of the corporate governance environment. In line with this prediction, we examine the impact of board characteristics on capital structure dynamics and the speed of adjustment. Using 2690 firm-year observations for 2009–2018, we find that firms in a stakeholder-oriented corporate governance environment adjust their leverage faster than those in a shareholder-oriented environment. We also find that corporate board characteristics influence firms' capital structure and speed of adjustment towards target leverage. Our findings are robust to alternative measures of leverage and endogeneity. The overall evidence supports the relevance of the corporate board's composition in both shareholder-oriented and stakeholder-oriented corporate governanc (CG) environments. We conclude that board composition mitigates agency conflict. © 2022 The Authors.

Prior literature suggests technological innovation and strong institutions are uniquely conducive to long-term economic growth. Property rights institutions (PRIs) afford protection from expropriation by the government and political elites, while contracting institutions (CIs) allow private parties to conduct commercial transactions. In this study, we systematically examine the relative effects of PRIs and CIs on innovation. Using an instrumental variable (IV) approach and two-stage least squares regression framework, our results suggest that PRIs have a strong positive effect on innovation, while CIs do not. Constraint on executive, protection from expropriation of the government, and protection of private property are proxies for PRIs, while legal formalism, procedural complexity, and number of procedures are proxies for CIs. We find strong empirical evidence that PRIs have statistically significant effects both on innovation intensity and time lag in innovation adoption, while the impacts of CIs on these measures of innovation are generally insignificant. Our findings are relevant to policymakers today as developing countries look to innovation to reignite their economies and avoid the middle-income trap. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",economic growth; financial development; innovation; institutions; property rights,economic growth; financial market; financial policy; innovation; least squares method; poverty; technological development
Between financial and algorithmic dynamics of cryptocurrencies: An exploratory study,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123468114&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2583&partnerID=40&md5=73eb31a56b6d28c793fa504e3a1c23c7,"This article aims at investigating the extent to which the algorithmic nature (i.e., mining process) of cryptocurrencies might influence their dynamics and interaction with some major economic indicators. Our study observes that proof-of-stake based cryptocurrencies are less correlated with other crypto-assets offering more opportunities for diversifying portfolio strategy. We also observe a positive correlation between the proof-of-work based cryptocurrencies and the oil price. This article discusses these matters and suggests that the differences in cryptocurrencies' dynamics are more related to their service or purpose rather than their mining protocol. This claim contributes to the current debates on the intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies and it is illustrated with a discussion of the Stellar (XLM) and Ether (ETH) cases. Beyond our empirical results, our article suggests that, the liquidity and the returns dynamics of cryptocurrencies might be affected by two different aspects. Precisely, the former appears to be influenced by the economic service for which these cryptocurrencies are used, while cryptocurrencies' returns are more reactive to the way their cryptographic validation is operated. Our findings also suggest that an analysis through the economic service/purpose of cryptocurrencies is actually appropriate to understand their dynamics in relation to economic indicators. This perspective implicitly questions the monetary aspect often associated with cryptocurrencies and it calls for a more categorized research (by economic purpose) of cryptocurrencies whose potential intrinsic value would then be related to their economic purpose. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Binance; Bitcoin; cryptocurrency; Ethereum; proof-of-stake; proof-of-work; Stellar,algorithm; currency market; financial market; financial services; stock market

Our simulation results show that for Uniform distribution, DP test has better power compared to JB test. For Logistic, Student t and Gamma distributions, we find JB normality test to be powerful compared to DP test. We further apply the moment-based normality tests empirically on the Indian stock market indices (NSE Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex) for different frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly) during the period from 2010 to 2020.

Long-term capital gains taxes and stock prices: Evidence from India,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118539952&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2582&partnerID=40&md5=f7d3322c230db158d6f4698f5a5e600b,"Prior studies of the relevance of long-term capital gains for stock prices rely on the evidence from the 1997 tax cut in the United States. The key component of the tax-sensitive ownership in these studies is individual ownership; its average is reported to be as high as 66.7%. The sharp increase in institutional ownership over the last two decades to more than 80% and the concomitant decline in individual ownership raises the question of whether taxes on long-term capital gains are still relevant for stock prices. We examine stock price responses to the 2018 increase in the long-term capital gains tax rate in India, a market where individual stock ownership is only 18.5%. Overall, the evidence provides strong support for the continued relevance of long-term capital gains taxes for stock prices despite individual investors accounting for only a small portion of the stock ownership. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",capital gains taxation; Indian stock market; individual ownership; lock-in effect; tax capitalization; tax-sensitive ownership,India; capital; price dynamics; stock market; tax system
How state ownership affects corporate R&D: An inverted-U-shaped relationship,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122139116&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2589&partnerID=40&md5=941b2ac530f0b8172ace3428fdf1d38f,"The existing literature provides mixed evidence about the effect of state ownership on corporate research and development (R&D). As this article hypothesizes, state ownership has a positive institutional effect on the investment environment for R&D and a negative institutional effect on firm operations for innovation. With evidence from China, we confirm that state-owned shares have an inverted-U-shaped causal effect on corporate R&D and that having the state as a minority shareholder is optimal for corporate R&D. We further document that, when a firm's R&D investment at least equals reinvestment of its profit, the threshold for state-owned shares is larger than it would be otherwise. Therefore, we justify the contradictory institutional effects of state ownership with an inverted-U-shaped relationship, thereby enhancing understanding of institutions and state ownership for corporate finance. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Access to resources; China; corporate R&D; inverted-U-shaped relationship; resource utilization; state ownership,China; finance; investment; research and development; state owned enterprise

Our analysis on the individual global standards shows that the relationship is much stronger for the use of full IFRS than IFRS for SMEs. We found that the effect of both international standards on domestic credit is more profound in countries with weaker institutional quality, indicating the overwhelming support that these sets of international standards are quality standards that boost confidence in financial statements.

We show that an increase in the use of robots increases the competitiveness of the unskilled sector and decreases the technological knowledge gap. However, under substitutability, unskilled workers are replaced by robots, and due to the magnitude of this effect the wage inequality increases. To mitigate this impact, public authorities can resort to fiscal and monetary policies. For instance, taxation on robots will induce the substitution of robots by unskilled labour, thus benefiting the unskilled labour—relative employment and wages. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",economic growth; fiscal and monetary policies; robots; wages; welfare,economic growth; fiscal policy; general equilibrium analysis; monetary policy; robotics; skilled labor; technical change; wage; welfare economics

The asymmetry in the underlying relationship of the concerned variables are examined following NARDL model over the period 1974–2016. The findings suggest the presence of regime shifts in the cointegrating relationship and asymmetry between growth volatility and financial deepening. Furthermore, the paper provides evidence of a significant difference in the response of business cycle to negative or positive changes in the financial deepening, which are more pronounced in the short run. Therefore, the obtained asymmetry suggests that business cycle responses are quick and adverse to changes in the financial system in the UAE.

In doing so, we have applied DY (2012) and BK (2018) spillover method. The overall spillover index value obtained from DY (2012) method is 62.29% and from BK method index value fluctuates with frequency. Further empirical evidence shows that the total connectedness, in the time and frequency domain, as measured by a rolling-window approach, has dynamic and volatile characteristics. Our overall results show that there is a high level of partial contemporaneous relationship between jet fuel, heating oil, US gasoline as well as diesel. Furthermore, results from the wavelet multiple correlations (WMCs) and cross-correlation show that heating oil acts as a leader for a short time horizon, whereas gasoline at medium and longer time scale. The results from the DY spillover analysis suggest that among the series analyzed heating oil has the highest contribution to others, which is confirmed across frequencies by the BK spillover method (and the Brent contributes least to others at all frequency bands).

A novel best-worst-method two-stage data envelopment analysis model considering decision makers' preferences: An application in bank branches evaluation,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126092789&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2609&partnerID=40&md5=2d9fecf456987a4721caf5fc05567bf3,"Data envelopment analysis (DEA) model has been applied for evaluating bank branches and recognizing efficient and inefficient branches can help bank managers to provide appropriate strategies to improve the inefficient branches' performance. Conventional DEA models are based on the ‘black box’ approach. However, the process of providing services in banks is made up of interactive and interdependent processes. Additionally, some managers tend to incorporate their preferences in evaluation process. In this paper, best worst method (BWM) is used for incorporating decision maker (DM) preferences in two-stage DEA model. First, BWM model is applied to obtain the weights of inputs, intermediate measures and outputs based on DM's judgement. Second, generated weights are imposed on two-stage DEA model as additional constraints and a novel bi-objective BWM-two stage DEA model is introduced. Finally, the proposed bi-objective BWM-two stage DEA model is solved using min-max approach. To illustrate the capability of proposed model, 45 Agricultural Bank (Agribank) branches in West Azerbaijan province of Iran are evaluated. The branches' processes are considered as two stages ‘production’ and ‘profitability’ and efficiency of branches are calculated in each stage. According to the efficiencies of each sub-stage, branches are divided to four groups and recommendations are made for each group. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",bank branches; best worst method; decision maker preferences; efficiency; two-stage DEA,Iran; West Azerbaijan; banking; data envelopment analysis; decision making; efficiency measurement; preference behavior
Enriching the value-at-risk framework to ensemble empirical mode decomposition with an application to the European carbon market,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115242926&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2578&partnerID=40&md5=a426fad69340908319921bde6a9f3be9,"Unlike common financial markets, the European carbon market is a typically heterogeneous market, characterised by multiple timescales and affected by extreme events. The traditional value-at-risk (VaR) with single-timescale fails to deal with the multi-timescale characteristics and the effects of extreme events, which can result in the VaR overestimation for carbon market risk. To measure accurately the risk on the European carbon market, we propose ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) based multiscale VaR approach. First, the EEMD algorithm is utilised to decompose the carbon price return into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different timescales and a residue, which are modelled respectively using the ARMA-GARCH model to obtain their conditional variances at different timescales. Furthermore, the Iterated Cumulative Sums of Squares algorithm is employed to determine the windows of an extreme event, so as to identify the IMFs influenced by an extreme event and conduct an exponentially weighted moving average on their conditional variations. Finally, the VaRs of various IMFs and the residue are estimated to reconstruct the overall VaR, the validity of which is verified later. Then, we illustrate the results by considering several European carbon futures contracts. Compared with the traditional VaR framework with single timescale, the proposed multiscale VaR-EEMD model can effectively reduce the influences of the heterogeneous environments (such as the influences of extreme events), and obtain a more accurate overall risk measure on the European carbon market. By acquiring the distributions of carbon market risks at different timescales, the proposed multiscale VaR-EEMD estimation is capable of understanding the fluctuation characteristics more comprehensively, which can provide new perspectives for exploring the evolution law of the risks on the European carbon market. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",ARMA-GARCH; ensemble empirical mode decomposition; European carbon market; exponentially weighted moving average; iterated cumulative sums of squares; value-at-risk,Europe; algorithm; extreme event; financial market

The result revealed that performance expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, trust, facilitating condition and habit constructs influence the behavioural intention to continuously adopt ‘e-wallet’ electronic payment system. On other hand, remarkably the perceived security construct portrays to have no significant influence which suggested that users are seemingly well inclined in policies that were executed by financial institutions which govern information's security.

The results show that more independent directors would lead to a less optimistic language (positive tone) and a more pessimistic language (negative tone) in the CSR report. The results also show that a higher ESG disclosure score leads to a more positive CSR narrative tone. However, gender diversity has a positive impact on the positivity of CSR tone when the ESG score is medium or high and when the board size exceeds 10 members.

What drives the distress risk–return puzzle?

This negative risk–return trade-off, known as the distress puzzle, poses a challenge to asset pricing models. In this study, we provide a new explanation of the distress puzzle by considering the effect of arbitrage asymmetry. We find that the negative distress risk–return relation is stronger in stocks that have higher limits of arbitrage. The investors are virtually unable to short sell mispriced high distress risk stocks due to the low supply of lendable stocks from institutions and that arbitrage is costly. In addition, we show that the limits of arbitrage effect is distinct from liquidity effect in explaining the distress puzzle. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",anomalies; distress risk; limits of arbitrage; market efficiency,empirical analysis; investment; market conditions; trade; trade-off

Household consumption and exchange rate extreme dynamics: Multiple asymmetric threshold non-linear autoregressive distributed lag model perspective,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122834857&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2601&partnerID=40&md5=ce240b5014344f292ad390d3cc0d1855,"This study re -evaluates the relative adjustments of household's consumption expenditure to extremely small and extremely large variations in exchange rate in African emerging economies (AEE). For this purpose, we used a modified version of non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and multiple threshold non-linear ARDL models that specifically captures the differential effects of extremely small and extremely large positive and negative variations of the explanatory variable(s) on the explained variable. Consequently, the empirical estimates reveal that changes in exchange rate has asymmetric effects on consumption expenditure in all the countries except in Nigeria. Furthermore, consumption expenditure in Algeria, Egypt and Morocco increases significantly at the upper quantile of exchange rate appreciation, whereas, it declines significantly at all quantiles of exchange rate depreciation, implying that consumption expenditure in these three North African countries are more sensitive to large positive shocks in exchange rate. In Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa, consumption expenditure are exchange rate inelastic as households maintain their consumption levels regardless of the direction and degree of exchange rate deviations. Overall, the diagnostics tests prove the superiority of this enhanced technique over the standard non-linear ARDL technique. Based on the outcomes of this study, policy recommendations that could ensure optimal exchange rate alignment for the African countries, as well as other emerging economies have been proposed. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",African emerging economies; asymmetry; exchange rate; household consumption; multiple asymmetric non-linear autoregressive distributed lagnon-linear autoregressive distributed lag,Algeria; Egypt; Kenya; Morocco; Nigeria; South Africa; asymmetry; exchange rate; financial policy; household expenditure; nonlinearity; regional economy
Incomplete information model of credit default of micro and small enterprises,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112721213&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2577&partnerID=40&md5=e54478209ace0277dbcaccc84515a674,"This research constructs a credit default estimation model for micro and small enterprises (MSEs) under the condition of changing information asymmetry. The model is established through the refinement, abstraction and portrayal of the core elements contained in the default trigger mechanism; this mechanism is based on the cash flow, the default boundary and the distribution of actual cash flow in the framework of the incomplete information model. By relaxing the assumption that the bank can fully observe the customer's initial information, this work constructs a theoretical model with practical application value that can effectively describe the default risk of MSEs. Numerical simulation shows that the model can accurately estimate the default probability of MSEs by quantitatively modelling the mechanism of default risk management and control which is applicable to the risk characteristics of MSEs. The model is also suitable for the continuous dynamic estimation and forecast of individual customer credit application and post-lending risk. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",credit default; dynamic evolution; incomplete information; micro and small enterprises; numerical simulation,asymmetry; banking; credit provision; estimation method; firm size; industrial enterprise; microfinance
Who benefits from corruption; the private individual or the public purse?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104341653&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2570&partnerID=40&md5=3e5b5e160803591ef5e1cb0ee53db477,"In this paper, we examine the impact of corruption on wealth distribution between the public purse and private individuals conditioned on the institutional quality of a country. We used panel data on 83 countries from 2000 to 2017. Our results indicate that corruption helps private individuals to accumulate more wealth at the expense of the public purse in countries with low-quality institutions. However, corruption increases the wealth in the public purse in countries with high-quality institutions. Our results, therefore, imply that the institutional quality of a country significantly shapes how corruption affects the wealth of private individuals and the public purse. The results are pronounced in developing countries and robust to alternative measurements and endogeneity test. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",corruption; institutional quality; private individual; public purse; wealth accumulation,corruption; developing world; institutional framework
Debt-to-GDP changes and the great recession: European Periphery versus European Core,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123943884&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2594&partnerID=40&md5=19fc8f4e41dda596afa3ac2529c8279d,"In this paper, we use simple accounting schemes and counterfactual experiments, to compare the sources of changes in the public debt to GDP ratio across countries of the European Periphery (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain), the European Core (Germany and France) and the other G7 countries (Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States), in two periods—2000–2007 and 2008–2015. In general, Debt-to-GDP ratio rose in all countries in the latter period. But the effects of total or primary fiscal deficits, inflation and real growth on the respective Debt-to-GDP ratio changes were different across countries in both periods. In the European Core, Ireland and the Anglo-Saxon countries, successful countercyclical fiscal policies, tended to lower Debt-to-GDP ratio. However, in the other European Periphery countries and Japan, unsuccessful countercyclical policies, had the opposite effect. Since in the Euro Area (EA), monetary policy is common and fiscal policies were restricted by rules, this development suggests that differences in shock propagation mechanisms were important drivers of the observed differences in the behaviour of Debt-to-GDP ratio between the European Core and the EA Periphery, except Ireland. An implication of this result is that the recently announced EU transfers to the EA Periphery tied up to incentives to improve economic efficiency, seem to be the right policies to ameliorate the effects of the recession brought about by the various social distancing measures to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, without increasing the Debt-to-GDP ratios of these countries. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",counterfactual experiments; Euro Area; inflation; public debt; real growth; shock propagation mechanism,Canada; Europe; France; Germany; Greece; Ireland; Italy; Japan; Portugal; Spain; United Kingdom; United States; debt; economic growth; economic impact; efficiency measurement; financial crisis; fiscal policy; Gross Domestic Product; inflation
A remark on mean-semivariance behaviour: Downside risk and capital asset pricing,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102042007&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2557&partnerID=40&md5=25a593fd318c132a72435fd06a7b9949,"In the conventional capital asset pricing model (CAPM), standard deviation as a measure of risk penalizes both upward and downward movements. However, while downward movements in investments are risky, upward movements are favourable. Therefore, standard semideviation that treats only those negative differences in returns over the benchmark as risky was proposed as a measure of downside risk. Attempts have been made to obtain the formulation of beta in this context, called downside beta. In this work, CAPM in the mean-semivariance framework (D-CAPM), with semivariance measured in terms of negative deviation around expected return, is derived and established that the model proposed earlier with a version of downside beta with respect to this definition of semivaraince is invalid. The appropriate version of downside beta is obtained, and under the rectified formulation, the validity of the true D-CAPM is empirically tested during July 2013–July 2018. The solution to the tangent point is also obtained. The proportion of investment in the stocks in the tangent portfolio and the downside beta for the stocks in the tangent portfolio are determined. We find that there is no evidence to disprove that D-CAPM holds true considering either Nifty 50 or S&P BSE Sensex as market portfolio. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",beta; capital asset pricing model; downside beta; downside capital asset pricing model; market portfolio; semivariance,capital; investment; modeling; pricing policy

To construct portfolio strategies, we first forecast assets' returns by using multivariate copula models. These forecasting frameworks enable us to undertake both symmetric and asymmetric tail connectedness in simulating from the joint distribution. Second, we applied four major risk measures including volatility, mean absolute deviation, conditional value-at-risk and conditional drawdown-at-Risk. Our findings indicate that the consideration of homogeneity of oil and gas sector and oil and gas related equipment and services sector, together with the heterogeneity of multiline utilities sector and renewable energy sector should lead to information decoupling among these sectors, thereby providing portfolio diversification. The mixed copula model results in better out-of-sample economic performance, indicating the advantage obtained from modelling both symmetric and asymmetric tail dependence. Our analysis of the portfolio weights, among the energy market sectors, shows that for optimal portfolios, multiline utilities and renewable energy sectors constitute higher portion of the invested assets. The study results provide an encouraging guideline for developing renewable energy sector from the perspective of financial market. © 2022 The Authors.

External openness enters the human capital accumulation function directly. Productive government expenditure affects human capital accumulation, relying on seigniorage revenue as finance where seigniorage is itself dependent on the level of openness. The findings indicate two, opposing effects of openness on growth - a direct effect of openness on growth through knowledge spillovers that affect human capital accumulation, and an indirect effect of decreasing seigniorage revenue on growth through decreasing productive government expenditure on human capital. We discuss conditions under which the openness-growth curve can be concave/convex, without specifying theoretical functional forms or values to unknown parameters in the model to provide concise theoretical results. Rather, drawing samples of exact model-match countries over (Figure presented.) – (Figure presented.), we rely on a semi-parametric, data-driven empirical approach to provide empirical impetus to the theoretical outcomes reported. We show the relationship between openness and growth is non-linear. Specifically, inverted U–shaped. The result suggests that openness only have a positive impact on the growth-rate until a certain threshold-level, thereafter, the effect is negative. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",human capital; knowledge spillovers; openness; seigniorage; semi–parametric estimation; spline regression,empirical analysis; endogenous growth; growth rate; human capital; public spending; theoretical study
Connectedness between G10 currencies: Searching for the causal structure,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128875429&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2629&partnerID=40&md5=9c55a9969eb875bea6d78b74064daea9,"This paper presents a new approach for modelling the connectedness between asset returns. We adapt the measure of Diebold and Yilmaz, which is based on the forecast error variance decomposition of a VAR model. However, their connectedness measure hinges on critical assumptions with regard to the variance–covariance matrix of the error terms. We propose to use a more agnostic empirical approach, based on a machine learning algorithm, to identify the contemporaneous structure. In a Monte Carlo study, we compare the different connectedness measures and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In an empirical application we analyse the connectedness between the G10 currencies. Our results suggest that the US dollar as well as the Norwegian krone are the most independent currencies in our sample. By contrast, the Swiss franc and New Zealand dollar have a negligible impact on other currencies. Moreover, a cluster analysis suggests that the currencies can be divided into three groups, which we classify as: commodity currencies, European currencies and safe haven/carry trade financing currencies. © 2022 The Authors.

The ability of U.S. macroeconomic variables to predict Asian financial market returns,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125645001&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2606&partnerID=40&md5=59966a96333a237f1cf5c321c0f50228,"This study conducts an extensive empirical investigation of whether 20 U.S. macroeconomic variables influence Asian financial market returns. The in-sample results show that certain U.S. macroeconomic variables, such as the commercial paper-to-Treasury-bill spread or the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, possess powerful abilities to predict Asian market returns. The out-of-sample results show that other macroeconomic variables, such as change in the inflation rate, also show predictive power. We also use combination methods that pool information from U.S. macroeconomic variables to improve their predictive ability, and find that doing so produces superior out-of-sample results. We therefore find that the 20 U.S. macroeconomic variables contain information that can be used to predict Asian market returns. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",financial crisis; in-sample; macroeconomic variables; out-of-sample; predictive ability,United States; empirical analysis; financial crisis; financial market; macroeconomics; manufacturing; prediction
Long-short speculator sentiment in agricultural commodity markets,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126444118&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2605&partnerID=40&md5=0f3b8f3f8459411a84cd90deca53b000,"This paper tests the hypothesis that long-short speculators are able to generate short-term investment returns based on their sentiment for 12 agricultural commodity futures. For this purpose, we dynamically model the equidirectional trading of long and short commodity futures of long-short speculators as a proxy for their market sentiment. We find evidence that the sentiment period returns are considerably positive and differ significantly from neutral sentiment periods for all commodities, which underlines the sentiment's relevance. In line with the empirical literature, we can reject the argument of price manipulation as the price continues to develop into the direction of the sentiment period although long-short speculators trade non-directionally in the following. We rather indicate the existence of a short-term time-series momentum effect, which can be robustly identified without the requirement to define an external model parameter. From the superior sentiment-based momentum returns, we conclude that long-short speculators have valuable, exclusive information, which cannot be replicated by observing their trading activity with a time lag of eight trading days. We also find that a sentiment-based momentum strategy generates significantly higher returns than the long-short speculators have realised in the 15-year sample period which we attribute to the complexity of the long-short speculators' investment strategies. © 2022 The Authors.

However, a framework that depicts the association between credit creation, financial innovation and endogenous creation of boom-bust cycles is less evident and the gap between empirical research and theoretical development remains. Hence, this study represents a first attempt to provide a framework that could explain the switch of economic cycles from virtuous to unvirtuous and vice versa. We examine the role of financial innovation and identify its “hidden soul” defined as the rate of financial innovation (RoFIN). We study RoFIN together with other structural factors, such as monopolistic financial power concentration and financial deregulation in the creation of what we identify as the wealth trap, as a potential mediating factor behind the creation of virtuous and unvirtuous cycles. A cross-country statistical exercise using the VUC indicator on the United States, United Kingdom, and Euro area economies shows the exponential effect of the rate of financial innovation over time and provides indicative evidence in support of our framework. Finally, we report that the indicator is better able to identify the unvirtuous cycle stages than the traditionally used Credit-to-GDP ratio. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",business cycle; financial innovation; financial power; financial system; growth; regulatory dialectic,United Kingdom; United States; business cycle; economic growth; financial market; financial system; Gross Domestic Product; regulatory framework

Impact of capital account liberalization on stock market crashes,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128106238&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2615&partnerID=40&md5=4e39a56360ce8ae727cbff53acc4fb73,"This paper examines the effect of capital account liberalization on the frequency of stock market crashes. We use de jure and de facto measures of capital account liberalization and employ a negative binomial random effect model to analyse the relationship. Using a sample of 65 countries for 1973–2016, we show that with restricted capital account liberalization, an increase in capital flows leads to a decrease in stock market crashes. With a more liberalized capital account convertibility, higher capital flows lead to a rise in stock market crashes. The main key finding supports the notion that free and unregulated capital flows induce more volatility in the stock market, and crashes in these markets are more likely to happen. These results are also robust to different sub-samples comprising of high-income OECD countries and non-OECD countries. Our results are also robust to change in the specification of stock market crashes and changes in capital flows' specification. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",capital account liberalization; economic development; Poisson regression; stock market crashes,capital; capital flow; economic development; financial crisis; liberalization; OECD; regression analysis; stock market

We estimate weekly dynamic conditional correlations and then optimal sectoral portfolio allocations between 1973 and 2019. Our results show that correlations of equity returns increased as a consequence of economic integration among European countries from the mid-1980s until the late 2000s, and decreased in the United Kingdom after Black Wednesday and the Brexit referendum. We tested the existence of a correlation change-point on June 27, 2016 by applying Wied et al. (2012)'s [Econometric Theory, 28(3), 570–589] correlation structural break test, which we modified to account for dynamic conditional correlations. Application of this test confirms that the referendum date was a break-point in nearly all UK manufacturing industries. The failure of Lehman Brothers and the 1987 stock market crash were also identified as structural breaks in equity correlations. Moreover, our findings suggest that the Brexit vote may constitute a long-term trend reversal of the convergence of equity return correlations in European markets, akin to Black Wednesday, rather than a shock like the 1987 and 2008 financial crises, which merely intensified a historical upward trend in correlations of European equity returns. © 2021 The Authors.

Role of foreign direct investment in decomposing of scale and technique effects on China's energy consumption,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123985934&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2597&partnerID=40&md5=c4d1c6b88057866130ca364e327cd35b,"This study contributes to the literature of energy economics by divulging the nature of scale and technique effects on energy consumption, considering foreign direct investment (FDI) as one of considerable factors of energy demand. The Chinese provincial data over the period of 2000–2018 are used for empirical analysis. In doing so, we have applied the Westerlund and Edgerton cointegration test using cross-sectional dependence and structural breaks, and bootstrapped quantile regression to decompose scale and technique effects. The empirical results show the presence of cointegrating association among the model parameters, in the presence of cross-sectional dependence and structural breaks. The quantile regression results indicate that the scale effect exerted by FDI is negative at lower quantiles of energy consumption, and positive at upper quantiles. Moreover, scale and technique effects exerted by FDI are positive and negative, respectively, at lower quantiles of energy consumption, and negative and positive, respectively, at higher quantiles. The results of this study are expected to help in designing the energy policies in China, keeping the quantum of energy consumption at various provinces in mind, and, thereby, ensuring the sustainability in energy consumption. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",China; energy consumption; income effect; quantile regression; scale effect,China; cointegration analysis; demand-side management; empirical analysis; energy use; foreign direct investment; regression analysis; sustainability

The overconfidence indicator provides a quantitative measure of the overconfidence expressed by the Fed chair, which is covered by the media, and thus, perceived by financial market participants. I relate this variable to inflation and unemployment expectations of market participants. Our results show that an overconfident Fed chair is significantly associated with higher inflation expectations and lower unemployment expectations. These findings are robust to (i) the macroeconomic forecasts used to extract the exogenous component of the media-based proxy reflecting Fed chair's overconfidence (the Survey of Professional Forecasters and the Greenbook forecasts) and (iii) an alternative proxy of inflation expectations.

As a one-sided moving average of the annualized inflation rate, it is approximately 6 months behind the annualized and monthly inflation rates and the CPI. The annual rate of inflation is, in fact, a smoothing transformation that removes the seasonal component from the annualized inflation rate, assuming the presence of all seasonal unit roots. In reality, however, the CPIs, and thus the annualized inflation rates, do not contain most of seasonal unit roots, resulting in spurious cycles of annual inflation rates, which pose difficulties in assessing and interpreting their development dynamics. Their practical applications in econometric analyses are limited because the unit root tests too often do not reject the zero hypothesis of the presence of unit roots when annual inflation rates are actually stationary. Parameter estimates of the annual inflation rate models are biased and inaccurate, allowing only incorrect short-term forecasts. The above facts make use of the annual inflation rate indicator in real economic situations questionable. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",inflation rate; moving average; seasonal component; spurious cycle,econometrics; inflation; seasonality; time series analysis; unit root test

IFRS 8 and the cost of capital in Europe,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122955229&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2590&partnerID=40&md5=534333923e8e721e8513c4aba431fa0b,"This study examines segment reporting information usefulness after the adoption of IFRS 8 in 18 European Union countries. Specifically, 1) we introduce a new comprehensive measure of segment reporting quality that reflects four different dimensions of segment information, 2) we investigate the impact of segment reporting quality on the cost of equity and debt capital after the adoption of IFRS 8, and 3) we investigate the moderating role of the country-level enforcement system on the association between segment reporting quality and the cost of equity and debt capital after the adoption of IFRS 8. Using a self-constructed segment reporting quality measure and a sample of 884 firm-year observations over the period of 2007 to 2011, we provide evidence that investors and lending institutions find no change in the usefulness of segment reporting after the adoption of IFRS 8. Our study is original in using a comprehensive measure of segment reporting quality. Furthermore, our study is the first to examine the relationship between segment reporting quality and the cost of debt capital after the adoption of IFRS 8 and the moderating role of the country-level enforcement system.

Responses to global financial standards in emerging markets: Regulatory neoliberalism and the Basel II Capital Accord,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103240011&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2554&partnerID=40&md5=8841f67a89c5f885db290a872b1361de,"This paper examines the diffusion of the Basel II Capital Accord into emerging markets (EMs). The literature on the diffusion of financial standards reinforces determinism: carefully derived standards such as those around financial liberalization are assumed to be applicable to all markets in an effort to promote stability and international harmonization. Attempts to use financial liberalization and macroprudential toolkits such as Basel II, however well intentioned, can increase rather than mitigate financial instability, due in part to unevenness in the adoption of financial standards. We analyse rich, action research data on the response of banks in 19 EMs in Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe to the advent of Basel II. We find heterogeneous rather than universalistic responses, captured as four types of behavioural variations leading to differences in the intensity of diffusion: Reformist, Instigative, Disobliging and Cosmetic. The variations reflect regulatory neoliberalism. The typology contributes to our understanding of the interaction between bank behaviour, regulator stance and institutional context as determinants of the diffusion of global financial standards. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Basel II Capital Accord; emerging markets; financial standard diffusion; macroprudential policy; regulatory neoliberalism,Asia; Eastern Europe; Middle East; financial market; liberalization; neoliberalism
Analysis of stock markets risk spillover with copula models under the background of Chinese financial opening,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128976832&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2632&partnerID=40&md5=d4c076fc2a858d6362e167ffcc530912,"This article adopts the new point of view on dynamic time-varying based research, combined with the Copula and CoVaR model, to analyse the risk spillover effect of mainland China, Hong Kong and the US stock markets as well as the multi-dimensional formation mechanism from the perspective of macroeconomic variables (VXFXI, EER, EPU and Liquidity) using TVP-VAR-SV and impulse response model. First, we find that the constructed copula models can address the asymmetry of stock market systemic risk spillover and the characteristics of co-movement with better tail dependence estimation. Second, there is an obvious risk spillover effect between the Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) and Shenzhen Component Index (SZEC). Due to the development of two connect programs, systemic risk can spread quickly from the Hang Seng Index (HSI) to SSEC and SZEC. Third, since the structure and participants of Chinese stock market, all macroeconomic variables make strongly positive and significant nonlinear impact on ΔCoVaR and exhibit significant non-symmetric characteristics in the long- and short-term perspectives, especially for EPU. These results indicate that strengthening the interconnections among systemically global stock markets is of important practical significance.

To this effect, the study employs a Tobit instrumental variables technique with data from 22 African countries for the period 2002–2018. The state antiquity index, recently provided by Ang and Fredriksson (2018), is used to capture statehood experience whereas rule of law, voice and accountability, regulatory quality, political stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness, and control of corruption are the indicators of the governance quality. Our results show that statehood experience, directly and indirectly, influences financial institutions' efficiency. The nature of the direct effect is negative, while that of the indirect effect depends on the governance indicator considered. Indeed, the negative effect of statehood experience is moderated by the strict application of the rule of law and amplified by control of corruption, political stability and absence of violence, and excessive regulation. Thus, to reduce the negative effect of statehood experience on the efficiency of financial institutions, older African states should: i) promote strict enforcement of the rule of law and alternation of power, and ii) relax regulation and government intervention. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",financial institutions' efficiency; governance; state antiquity; Tobit with instrumental variables,Africa; financial market; financial services; financial system; governance approach; regulatory framework

Therefore, policymakers should emphasize strategies that foster access to quality and affordable financial services and products, to improve inclusive growth in the continent. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",economic growth; financial inclusion; generalized method of moments (GMM); principal component analysis; Sub-Saharan Africa countries,Sub-Saharan Africa; economic growth; financial services; principal component analysis; regional economy; strategic approach; testing method
Clarifying the impact of corporate governance and intellectual capital on financial performance: A longitudinal study of Deutsche Bank (1957–2019),2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128527132&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2620&partnerID=40&md5=0d88442b2c308216552d68d1584b9cdb,"This article empirically examines the nexuses between corporate governance, intangible resources, CEO traits, and financial performance. In contrast to prior research, this study examines these relationships in a longitudinal manner focusing on Deutsche Bank for the 1957–2019 period. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind. Based on a novel hand collected dataset, our analysis suggests a significant positive relationship between intangible assets i.e., intellectual capital efficiency and financial performance measured by, return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). Our results further suggest that human capital efficiency drive the financial performance of Deutsche Bank at all times especially, during the economic malaise periods, suggesting that human capital is the main source of profitability for the Deutsche Bank. Additional results suggest that larger board size diminishes the impact of intangible resources on financial performance when the former CEO assumes board's chairmanship. Finally, our results suggest that CEO's education quality is an important determinant of financial performance during the crisis. Results observed in this study have important economic and policy implications for banks operating in the similar environments. © 2022 The Authors.

In addition, it evaluates the economic cost of tests, deaths, COVID-19 cases in terms of reduction in GDP growth rate across the countries. This paper uses a different econometrics model, including analysis of variance (ANOVA), regression, and multinomial regression model. The robust regression model with M and MM-estimation was also used due to leverage and residuals in country wise GDP database. A significant difference was found in deaths per million (DPM), TPM, number of COVID-19 cases (CPM), and percentage of people aged 65 and above (PAO) across continents. The DPM is negatively associated with TPM, and it was relatively more effective in reducing DPM in Africa (0.32%) as compared to Asia (0.25%) and Europe (0.28). The results show that a 1% increase in the elderly population causes a 0.62% increase in DPM in Africa, while it caused a 2.31% increase in Europe.

Synthetic money: Addressing the budget-constraint issue,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128733145&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2618&partnerID=40&md5=5efa110067a64a00ac085b3853adcd63,"A synthetic currency attempts to mimic a target currency with an optimal portfolio of other currencies, without having a position in the target currency. The original construction methodology of a synthetic currency imposed a budget constraint such that the portfolio weights sum to a non-zero value, (Figure presented.) say. However, a synthetic currency is a portfolio of invariant currency indexes, rather than a portfolio of currency positions. In this article, we show that invariant currency indexes are tradable multilateral exchange rates. Consequently, the sum-to-x budget constraint unintentionally creates a non-zero position in the target currency. We address this budget-constraint issue by replacing the sum-to-x budget constraint with a sum-to-zero budget constraint, which correctly enforces a zero position in the target currency. Once the budget-constraint issue is addressed, investors are faced with the fact that synthetic money is unable to mimic significant currency-specific movements in target currencies. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",foreign exchange rates; synthetic money,currency; exchange rate; investment
Oil price volatility and stock returns: Evidence from three oil-price wars,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122242056&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2588&partnerID=40&md5=bd3216bee42bb10dab1711d635571ef3,"This study examines how crude oil price volatility affected the stock returns of major global oil and gas corporations during three major oil-price wars that took place between October 1991 and June 2020. Episodes considered include the 1998 Saudi Arabia – Venezuela war, the 2014–2016 conflict and the 2020 Saudi Arabia – Russia war in a time of unprecedented crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The persistence of volatility in oil prices during times of specific oil-price wars is captured through generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model while the leverage effect is tested using the threshold generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (T-GARCH) model. Moreover, a vector autoregressive (VAR) model is employed to consider the relationship between oil price shocks and stock returns of oil and gas corporations. Our findings reveal a significant evidence for volatility persistence and leverage effects in oil price during the three oil-price wars. These findings are consistent for WTI as well as Brent crude oil specifications. Though the persistence of volatility is similar to that of the previous two oil-price wars, the 2020 Saudi Arabia – Russia oil-price war has higher volatility spikes than the previous two wars. Besides, oil price shocks have a significant and positive effect on the returns of oil and gas companies. These findings provide investors information on how volatility in global oil prices is also sensitive to irregular events such as price wars between oil producers. This information can be important for economic agents contemplating shorter hedges by managing risks during times of high volatility. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",crude oil; oil and gas corporations; oil-price wars; stock returns; volatility | SVAR-DCC-GARCH,Saudi Arabia; Venezuela; economic development; oil industry; price determination; price dynamics; pricing policy
Is the Fisher effect asymmetric?

The asymmetry considered is that the long-run change in the interest rate is larger when inflation rises than when it falls. The possibility follows from behavioural hypotheses about the relationship of inflation expectations to actual inflation. Using an asymmetric cointegration approach, we find asymmetric cointegration in the Fisher effect for the post-war period through 1979, but not subsequently. We then find that starting in 1980, a breakdown developed in the relationship between inflation expectations from surveys and actual recent inflation rates, a breakdown not accounted for by asymmetry. If the survey results approximate true expectations, then econometric testing using actual recent inflation to compute expected inflation will suffer from mismeasurement, which could explain the finding of no cointegrating Fisher effect post-1979. The paper accounts for breakpoints and uses bootstrapping to conservatively estimate statistical significance. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",asymmetric cointegration; bootstrapping; Fisher effect; inflation expectations,bootstrapping; cointegration analysis; financial crisis; financial market; financial services; inflation; interest rate
The importance of staying positive: The impact of emotions on attitude to risk,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122853949&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2591&partnerID=40&md5=ead567c46615f7a211d39a96b8377b14,"In this article, we examine the impact of emotions towards financial investments and emotions towards life in general on attitudes to financial risk using questionnaire data from 970 UK-based retail investors. We show that risk tolerance monotonically increases with positive emotions towards investments and life, and decreases with negative emotions. We incorporate a broader range of relevant emotions than in comparable existing studies, and we show, perhaps surprisingly, that positive emotions have a more substantial impact on risk tolerance than negative emotions. We find that emotions towards investments have a considerably greater explanatory power for the cross-section of risk aversion than gender, age, income, investment experience and investment knowledge. Our research sheds light on the different impacts that integral and background emotions have on retail investor financial decision-making. We suggest several implications for regulators and financial advisors, and we emphasize the importance for financial educators to support investors in developing emotional resilience. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",attitude to risk; emotions; retail investors; risk aversion; risk tolerance,United Kingdom; decision making; investment; questionnaire survey; retailing
Macroeconomic risks and capital structure adjustment speed: The Chinese evidence,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164093311&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2569&partnerID=40&md5=a3b4e3eb3e9a4f8c0cd9c9cfdb09e2de,"Using both integrated and two-stage dynamic partial adjustment capital structure models, we find evidence that macroeconomic conditions affect Chinese firms' capital structure adjustment speeds towards target leverage. Chinese firms revert towards target leverages faster in high economic growth states than in low economic growth states as measured by bond and stock market capitalization relative to GDP, banking sector development, real interest rate and risk premiums. Overall, firms that are financially unconstrained, of large size, and those with small deviation of actual leverage from target leverage rebalance faster towards the target leverage than the counterparts. The same findings occur during high economic growth states, while variations in adjustment speeds exist among firms with different financial constraints and distance to target leverage during low economic growth states. The firms' leverage adjustment speed depends on the adjustment cost associated with added debt or debt replaced with internal funds or equity. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",capital structure; capital structure adjustment speed; Chinese corporate; finance; financial policy; macroeconomic,China; banking; capital market; capital provision; financial market; financial policy; financial services; macroeconomics; stock market
Asymmetric responses to Purchasing Managers' Index announcements in China's stock returns,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110046231&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2576&partnerID=40&md5=70d038d5f9efe0eb156e9ebf4f9543eb,"The study empirically analyzes the stock market response to the announcements of China's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI). Asymmetric effects are observed, as follows: negative PMI announcements do not appear to influence the stock market, whereas positive PMI announcements have a significant effect. Evidence further suggests that negative announcements remain nonsignificant under any economic period (e.g., expansion, contraction, or stability), while the positivity effect observed becomes increasingly significant during both economic expansion and stability periods. Our study is not consistent with international experience, which suggests stock markets are more sensitive to negative news. A test sample of individual stocks was used to further investigate this phenomenon. We observed stocks characterised with lower levels of institutional ownership, smaller firm size, higher liquidity or low stock prices, react to positive news more consistently. These types of stocks are generally favoured by individual investors who are more easily influenced by positive PMI news. Unlike stock markets of America or Europe, individual investors dominate China's stock market. The ‘rise-chasing and down-freezing’ behaviour of the individual investors may explain why China's market reacts more readily to positive PMI announcements. Note: The ‘rise-chasing and down-freezing’ phenomenon refers to an investor who buys winning stocks warmly, while keeps the losing stocks at hand. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",asymmetric response; Chinese stock market; economic period; individual investors; PMI announcements; rise-chasing and down-freezing,China; economic development; empirical analysis; financial market; financial provision; stock market

Despite notable improvements in these capital-scarce countries' economic, political and social conditions, foreign investors have not considered them viable host locations. Since FDI brings enormous spillovers to its host, some countries have recently institutionalized globalization as the catalyst for reversing the trend. Against this backdrop, we examine the FDI-globalization nexus across 47 African countries for the 1996–2016 period. Using the augmented mean group estimator, the results suggest that FDI in Africa is indeed globalization-induced. Moreover, we find this positive nexus to be driven by the economic dimension of globalization.

The results show four clubs and four divergent countries. In addition, the analysis identifies certain factors, such as economic openness, public intervention and education, as the main drivers of inequality reduction.

We argue, and find, that the stock market connection enhances the informational feedback effect of stock prices and involves more-sophisticated investors' monitoring and advising on firm management, and thereby spurs corporate innovation. We further show that the positive effect of the stock market connection on innovation is more pronounced for non-state-owned firms, firms with few political connections, firms with weak intellectual property rights protection or firms that are headquartered in non-high-tech economic zones.

This study verified the long-run relationships between risk-free interest rates and underwriting profits for individual lines. Specifically, the long-run sensitivities of interest rates for less regulated long-tail lines were greater than those for other lines. We also found that the length of tail acted as a crucial part of the feedback dynamics. The shorter the tails, the greater the tendency to go back to equilibrium, while the longer the tails, the smaller the tendency. In addition, an analysis of cumulative dynamic multipliers showed that the adjustment patterns for the lagged effects of interest rates varied for each business line.

SCP explains mutual fund actions after placing the fund manager at the center of fund operations, where their conduct is driven by structure of markets and the funds management industry. Structural influences on fund managers include unpredictability of markets, the oligopolistic nature of the mutual fund industry, and disengagement of clients. As a result, funds derive income as commission on assets under management, which is sub-optimal for clients. In addition, fund managers' conduct is driven by their homogeneity and socialization with competitors and investee firms. While the most obvious role of fund managers is construction of investment portfolios, outperformance is not their sole, or perhaps even principal, objective. The SCP lens offers insights into mutual funds of value to fund managers, investors, regulators and executives of investee firms. This paper impounds evidence from real-world data in theory to offer an actor-centric perspective of investment which is an archetypal practitioner driven discipline. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",fund managers; investment theory; Mutual funds; SCP paradigm,homogeneity; investment; retirement; savings
Economic policy uncertainty and stock markets’ co-movements,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124608239&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2603&partnerID=40&md5=094e6c7bceabc4c1409747e38cba537a,"Here, we investigate the direction of the relationship between economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and stock markets. We focus on time-variant co-movements between the EPU index and selected stock market indices (S&P500, UK100, Nikkei225 and DAX30) at different investment horizons. We show that the EPU index lags stock markets at longer investment horizons during global financial turmoil, especially in the United States, Japan and Germany. The identified lag between the changes of the EPU index and selected stock market indices ranges between 2 and 6 months at investment horizons exceeding 32 months. In addition, we confirm the existence of the short-term effects of EPU on stock markets. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",economic policy uncertainty; stock markets; wavelet analysis,Germany; Japan; United States; economic policy; financial market; financial services; stock market; uncertainty analysis; wavelet analysis

The study is conducted on a sample period between January 2000 and December 2019 and applies an extension of the Fama and French five-factor model (2015) using the quantile regression methodology. Specifically, this research extends the Fama and French (2015) factor model by adding risk factors such as nominal interest rates, momentum and momentum reversal factors (Carhart, 1997) and the traded liquidity factor (Pastor and Stambaugh, 2003). For robustness, this study splits the entire sample period into three sub-periods: pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis. As expected, the highest R2 coefficients are observed in the extreme quantiles, that is, in the bullish and bearish market states, revealing a U-shaped relationship in the explanatory power of this factor model. © 2022 The Authors.

The short-run and long-run effects of trade openness on financial development: Some panel evidence for Europe,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128416523&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2626&partnerID=40&md5=57ddf15684a71086c76618755ed24916,"This paper analyses the short- and long-run effects of trade openness on financial development in a panel including data on 35 European countries over the period 2001–2019. For this purpose, it uses the pooled mean group (PMG) estimator for dynamic panels developed by Pesaran et al. (Journal of the American Statistical Association, 1999;94:621). The results differ depending on the income, governance and financial development level of the countries considered. In particular, it appears that in the middle-income countries trade openness tends to strengthen financial development in the long run but to have an adverse effect in the short run. By contrast, in the case of high-income countries with better institutions and a higher level of financial development, there is a positive and significant impact in the short run. Some policy implications of these findings are drawn. © 2022 The Authors.

What are the triggers for arrears on debt over a business cycle? Evidence from panel data,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100890483&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2565&partnerID=40&md5=13c573af2922ad69685023e6418d85e6,"The paper investigates the triggers of arrears on debt in a full recourse euro area country. An extensive individual-level quarterly panel dataset enables quarterly arrears on debt to be tracked while controlling for individual specific heterogeneity. The estimations show that lower income and higher debt service ratios are associated with a higher probability of arrears, confirming the “ability to pay” hypothesis. The results reveal different debt repayment behaviour for housing and consumer loans over a business cycle. Newly taken housing loans exhibit a lower probability of arrears and the same applies to loans granted during the period of easy credit conditions and high real estate prices, indicating that housing credit boom has not contributed to the rise in arrears on debt. Newly taken consumer loans are related to a higher probability of arrears, suggesting that consumer loans have been used to alleviate financial difficulties. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",arrears; consumer loans; credit conditions; housing loans; income shock; the debt service ratio,Europe; business cycle; credit provision; debt; finance; low income population; panel data

The empirical results underscore that the external governance mechanism and its dimensions in particular the political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption impact Islamic banks' profitability positively. However, the regulatory settings and its sub-indices particularly the extent of disclosure and ease of shareholder suits have the opposite effect. Likewise, the results of traditional determinants indicate that the profitability of Islamic banks is shaped by the bank-specific, industry-specific, and country and global-level determinants. Results are robust and consistent with alternative estimation procedures and also support for the negative and positive effect of voice and accountability external governance's dimension and inflation, respectively.

Findings show that both industry concentration and operating environment have a significant relationship with employee mobility, implying that when a firm has a market share advantage, then it should provide a better welfare mechanism. Corporate governance also has an impact on employee mobility. When the shareholding ratios of major shareholders and managers increase, more attention should be paid to the promotion and feedback mechanism of grassroots employees. Thus, corporate governance should be designed to take into account shareholder expectations and employee stability. From the empirical results, we see that the conditions of corporate governance are important factors affecting employee mobility. This study compares the food industry and the technology industry and finds that the relationship between corporate governance and employee mobility runs in opposite directions between the two industries, which means that corporate governance in the technology industry and the food industry exhibits different benefits. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",corporate governance; economic condition; employee mobility; food industry; industry concentration,Taiwan; corporate strategy; employment; food industry; governance approach; high technology industry; industrial performance; industrial practice; labor market; labor mobility; technological development; welfare economics

Using System Generalized Method of Moments estimates to control for different types of endogeneity, the main findings of this paper suggest that non-compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code adversely affects shareholder value. Furthermore, ex-post estimates reveal that compliance with certain corporate governance mechanisms is more beneficial than others. With regard to this, compliance with provisions related to board independence is more important than complying with performance-related pay requirements of the code.

Strive towards investment efficiency among Egyptian companies: Do board characteristics and information asymmetry matter?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100459921&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2540&partnerID=40&md5=542ccbd4d4a190e01cbddcc711aa7660,"This study examines the impact of the board of directors (BoD) characteristics, namely BoD independence, compensation, leadership, and CEO career concerns on investment efficiency, using information asymmetry as a mediator. Using a sample of 326 firm-year observations of non-financial firms listed in the EGX 100 Index of the Egyptian stock market from 2014 to 2018, we find that board independence, board compensation, and board leadership are negatively associated with inefficient investment and information asymmetry, whereas the opposite is true for CEO career concerns. Furthermore, a positive relationship between information asymmetry and inefficient investment is documented. Finally, we find that information asymmetry mediates the relationship between the three BoD characteristics (i.e., board independence, leadership, and compensation) and inefficient investment. Conversely, it does not interfere with the relationship between CEO career concerns and inefficient investment. These findings are consistent in both under-investment and over-investment scenarios and across the pooled sample. Our findings contribute to corporate governance and investment literature by addressing new relationships, providing empirical evidence from a one-tier board model in developing countries, and offering a useful explanation for the inconsistent results in prior studies. These findings help regulators, investors, and policymakers realize the importance of BoD characteristics in mitigating information asymmetry and improving corporate investment efficiency. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",board compensation; board independence; board leadership; CEO career concerns; Egyptian stock market; information asymmetry; investment efficiency,Egypt; capital flow; capital market; efficiency measurement; investment; leadership; stock market
The determinants of bank profitability of GCC: The role of bank liquidity as moderating variable—Further analysis,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100515690&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2485&partnerID=40&md5=3be13de8ae7107a483b6f5624b2dfa01,"The motivation of this study stems from the mixed views concerning the determinants of bank profitability and the moderating role of bank liquidity in the relationship. The study primarily aims to investigate the bank profitability determinants among GCC nations. Data are obtained from the GCC banks for the period from 2000 to 2018, and then data are analysed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. On the basis of the obtained findings, the size of the bank and the management of assets significantly impact the GCC banks' performance. In addition, bank liquidity has a moderating role in the relationship between capital adequacy and assets quality, and GCC banks' performance. Further analysis shows that the bank's profitability score has a positive association. In addition, bank liquidity has a positive moderate effect relationship between the bank's profitability score and the GCC bank's performance. This study provides implications for the bank profitability determinants in emerging economies, within which there is common profitability, and this is expected to assist policymakers, regulators and shareholders in discerning the banks' attractiveness towards investors. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bank liquidity; bank performance; bank profitability; further analysis; GCC countries,banking; financial services; investment; performance assessment; profitability; regression analysis

We present evidence that shows a significant role of compositing country risk on this. Specifically speaking, FDI deteriorates inequality under the condition of high risk, whereas it alleviates inequality in a country with low country risk. Moreover, we can also obtain the similar findings by considering the role of components of country risk (economic risk, financial risk and political risk) as a determinant for the FDI-inequality nexus.

Based on the COSO Framework, Basel Committee Frameworks, and the literature, the components of the internal controls are quantified. This quantitative nature distinguishes this study from others in this field since most of the studies up to now have investigated these topics by theoretical approaches. Eleven independent variables are analysed in three different regression models, with credit risk, profitability, and compliance being the dependent variables in each model. After cleaning the data from outliers, several tests are performed, while a panel set of data is used comprising the 210 biggest U.S. bank holding companies. Fixed-effects regression is applied in the three models, while the years under examination are the five fiscal years 2013–2017. Most of the data are taken from the proxy statements (DEF 14A) and the 10-K statements because of their qualitative nature. The key results indicate that Risk Assessment, Control Activities, and Information and Communication components strongly affect credit risk. The first (Control Environment) and last (Monitoring) components have a significant effect on credit risk, though only from the perspective of the board's number and the expertise of the audit committee, respectively. In the same line, internal controls significantly affect the profitability and compliance of U.S. banks, except for the Risk Assessment component in the first case and the Control Environment component in the second case, respectively. Control Activities component and the Information and Communication component have a significant and positive relationship with the banks' profitability, while these two components are significantly and negatively correlated with the banks' compliance. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",compliance; COSO framework; credit risk; internal control system; profitability; U.S. banks,United States; banking; compliance; control system; credit provision; financial market; profitability; quantitative analysis

We demonstrate that corruption has a negative effect on the growth of firms with SHEs, FOEs, and non-SOEs but a positive effect in SOEs. We also document that the difference in the levels of corruption across different provinces can be influenced by the quality of the local business environment, but again, those impacts are heterogeneous in firms with different ownership identities. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",business environment; corruption; emerging market; firm growth,Viet Nam; business development; corruption; developing world; economic development; firm ownership; industrial development; state owned enterprise; World Bank

In this paper, we first propose GARCH models in the framework of MIDAS augmented to include the impacts of extreme shocks on oil price volatility. In-sample results show that extreme shocks can induce the additional volatility of crude oil. Further, the results from out-of-sample clearly indicate that the crude oil volatility is best fitted by the EGARCH-MIDAS-ES model, which incorporates asymmetric effects in the short-term component and the significant effect of extreme shocks in the long-term component. Additionally, robustness tests confirm that the augmented volatility models can produce better prediction results, both statistically and economically, than the conventional GARCH-MIDAS model. Furthermore, we verify that negative extreme shocks can cause larger volatility, whereas positive extreme shocks of the same magnitude have smaller effects. Our contribution offers fresh insights into energy price volatility forecasting by considering extreme shocks. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",extreme shocks; GARCH-MIDAS; oil price; volatility forecasting,crude oil; energy market; oil industry; prediction; price dynamics

We find a “son effect” in long-term resource allocation among family firms, that is, owners raising sons tend to have a longer investment horizon and are more willing to increase innovation. This “son effect” is more significant for owners who were born in patriarchal regions where the social system is controlled or governed by men. We also find that son-raising owners' long-term resource allocation is mainly motivated by their willingness of intergenerational inheritance.

We explore the optimal conditional heteroscedasticity model with regards to goodness-of-fit to these sectorial indices. In particular, it proposes four models (EGARCH, FIGARCH, FIEGARCH and TGARCH) to measure asymmetric and persistence volatility. Our findings point to three interesting results. First, following the COVID-19 outbreak, volatility is more persistent in all series. Second, the results show that building constructs materials, construction and food and beverage sector return volatilities have an insignificant asymmetric effect while consumer service, financials and distribution, industrials, basic materials and banks sector return volatilities have relatively high positive and significant asymmetric effect compared with those during the pre-COVID-19 period. Finally, the findings show that financial services, automobile and parts, insurance and TUNINDEX20 sectors have insignificant leverage effect.

The cross-sectional error correction model with the estimation by dynamic common correlated effect technique, is used. We find that economic globalization as a whole increases the public debt in the short run while decreases it in the long run. For its dimensions, we show that financial globalization increases the public debt in the short and long run, while trade globalization increases the public debt in the short run but decreases it in the long run. Consideration of the de jure and de facto aspects of economic globalization shows that the de jure economic globalization does not influence government debt while its trade dimension reduces the short-run public debt and its financial dimension increases the long-run public debt. The de facto economic globalization and its dimensions increase public debt in the short run, while in the long run only the de facto trade globalization belittles the public debt. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",cointegration; cross-sectional dependence; economic globalization; panel; public debt; Sub-Saharan Africa,Sub-Saharan Africa; debt; estimation method; globalization; panel data; trade

Second, a group of upper-middle income economies, namely, Malaysia and Thailand, and in recent decades, China, have shaped the dynamics of growth in the region, which suggests that the methods we employ in this study can pick-up the value-added production chains, for which these economies are a central part. Third, by and large, two blocs of economies have formed over time in terms of closer bilateral connectedness, that is, the ASEAN-5 (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand), and a relatively looser formation among the three Northeast Asian economies of China, Japan and Korea. Finally, we find no evidence that the region has completely decoupled from the United States over time. However, one new dimension we discover is that the nature and intensity of the business cycle connectedness of the region vis-à-vis the United States tends to vary over time, both on an aggregate and bilateral level. These findings highlight the need to go beyond static analysis and to utilize a dynamic approach for growth cycles within and outside the region. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Asia-Pacific; business cycle; connectedness; decoupling; network,China; Indonesia; Japan; Korea; Malaysia; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim; Philippines; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Thailand; United States; business cycle; business development; economic growth; national economy; network analysis; regional economy
"Role of capital investment, investment risks, and globalization in economic growth",2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100354015&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2514&partnerID=40&md5=d9e8d1a8dda7a71aa8310fda57e4dfc7,"The study investigates the role of public and private capital investment and globalization in the economic growth of 34 Asian economies along with investment risk and demographic pressure. By applying the two-step system generalized method of moment, results show that private capital investment in Asian emerging-economies has been a substantial positive impact on regional economic growth and is significantly influenced by low-investment risks and demographic conditions as compared to low-income and advance-economies from 2001 to 2019. It further states that economic globalization accelerates the economic growth in Asian emerging, developing, and low-income economies compared to advanced-economies. This study contributes to the existing literature by analyzing Asian economies in two ways (separately public and private investment and economic globalization index to economic growth), which has been scarce in this regard. The study also suggests that private capital investment should be backed with low-risk investment policies that create more private investment, enhance the institutional capacity, productivity, and attract foreign investors. This study's findings highlight that, for the development of the economies, private-investment inclusion with public-investment is the backbone that can accelerate economic growth by controlling external pressures and business risk in the country with effective public policies. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",economic growth; generalized method of moments (GMM); investment risk; private capital investment; public capital investment,Asia; business development; capital; economic growth; financial crisis; financial market; globalization; investment
Analyzing airlines stock price volatility during COVID-19 pandemic through internet search data,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100295072&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2490&partnerID=40&md5=fcf0e06d77a97f33a4aa90395599c88e,"Recent Coronavirus pandemic has prompted many regulations which are affecting the stock market. Especially because of lockdown policies across the world, the airlines industry is suffering. We analyse the stock price movements of three major airlines companies using a new approach which leverages a measure of internet concern on different topics. In this approach, Twitter data and Google Trends are used to create a set of predictors which then leads to an appropriately modified GARCH model. In the analysis, first we show that the ongoing pandemic has an unprecedented severe effect. Then, the proposed model is used to analyse and forecast stock price volatility of the airlines companies. The findings establish that our approach can successfully use the effects of internet concern for different topics on the movement of stock price index and provide good forecasting accuracy. Model confidence set (MCS) procedure further shows that the short-term volatility forecasts are more accurate for this method than other candidate models. Thus, it can be used to understand the stock market during a pandemic in a better way. Further, the proposed approach is attractive and flexible, and can be extended to other related problems as well. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",American Airlines; COVID-19; Delta Airlines; Google Trends; Twitter data; United Airlines,United States; airline industry; COVID-19; forecasting method; Internet; price dynamics; stock market
The euro to dollar exchange rate in the Covid-19 era: Evidence from spectral causality and Markov-switching estimation,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100310237&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2524&partnerID=40&md5=15292f088bad5a5ac5b2e4e82e22dbf0,"In this paper, we analyse how the Covid-19 pandemic changed the dynamics of the euro to dollar exchange rate. To do so, we make use of spectral non-causality tests to uncover the determinants of the euro to dollar exchange rate, using data that cover the pre-Covid-19 and the actual Covid-19 era, by considering the exchange rate movements of other currencies, the stock market index of S&P 500, and the price of oil and gold, as well as their realized volatilities. Based on our findings, the Covid-19 pandemic has indeed significantly changed the determinants of the euro to dollar exchange rate. Also, to investigate the potential shifts in the regimes of the euro to dollar exchange rate, we formulate a Markov-switching model with two regimes, based on the determinants that have been found in the previous step. Based on our findings, the duration of the high volatility state in the Covid-19 era has doubled, from almost 3 to approximately 6 days, compared to the pre-Covid-19 era, whereas the high volatility state in the Covid-19 era is characterized by a statistically significant higher range of volatility compared to the pre-Covid-19 era. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Covid-19; euro to dollar; exchange rate; Markov-switching; spectral causality,COVID-19; currency; estimation method; exchange rate; Markov chain; spectral analysis
Evaluation of risk adjusted performance of mutual funds in an emerging market,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100544418&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2486&partnerID=40&md5=c0a676776d506d38d9a94f587ff2802c,"The objective of this study is to find the efficiency of an emerging-market (Pakistan) mutual funds, with reference to different measures of risks that contradict each other. We have measured risk-adjusted performance of open-ended equity funds of mutual funds. The reason for selecting equity funds is that it is consistent with the proxy benchmark as 100-index. As 100-index is also tracked by equities and equity funds that also consist of equity investment, it will be more appropriate to select equity funds. So, this study is limited to equity funds traded in Pakistan. The novelty of this study is its introduction of the Martin or Ulcer ratio, which is rarely used in Pakistani literature. This study will also limit the period under consideration from 2011 to 2019 to exclude the years 2008 to 2011 due to the crisis faced by the financial market in 2008 after which it took about two to three years to get the market back to its normal course. The statistics and probability values did not provide sufficient evidence to reject the hypothesis of market efficiency. The values support the efficient market hypothesis that even experienced and qualified funds manager, having sound market insights, cannot earn returns above the market, that is, the average returns of market and the average returns of each fund are equal. On the other hand, the risk adjusted returns including Sharpe, Treynor, Jensen's and Ulcer measures, are all on average negative. There may be qualitative factors affecting the returns to be equal or less than the risk free and market returns. Further research can explore the qualitative factors, for example, managers' qualification, funds goodwill, political instability and macroeconomic factors affecting the returns of funds. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Jensen's alpha; martin ratio; mutual funds; risk adjusted performance; sharpe ratio; Treynor's ratio; ulcer index,Pakistan; equity; financial market; macroeconomics; market conditions; probability; qualitative analysis
Time-varying causality between bond and oil markets of the United States: Evidence from over one and half centuries of data,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100574162&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2534&partnerID=40&md5=de1980de8ec7ecf1b3b4e74391989947,"This paper analyzes the time-varying causality between government bond and oil returns of the United States over the monthly period of 1859:10 to 2019:03, that is, the longest possible span of historical data, starting from the beginning of the modern era of the petroleum industry. While the standard constant parameter causality test fails to pick up any evidence of causality, the time-varying framework shows evidence of bi-directional spillovers over the entire sample period. The results are robust to the inclusion of stock returns as a control variable in the model. We also detect evidence of time-varying causality-in-volatility between sovereign bond and oil markets, as well as spillovers in returns and volatility from the oil market to corporate bonds. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bond and oil markets; returns and volatility spillovers; time-varying causality,United States; energy market; oil industry; oil supply; spillover effect

We classify IPOs within industry IPO waves and within local IPO waves, and see that the sub-samples of IPOs on the wave by industry only slightly overlap IPOs on the wave by region; IPO waves by region are similar to IPO waves by industry: for example, early-in-the-wave IPOs are equally more underpriced than late-in-the-wave IPOs. We also find the listing decision is sensitive not only to high valuations of firms in the same industry but also to high valuations of firms in the same region but in different industries. Our results do not support information spillover as a driver of local IPO waves, as the post-IPO fall in profitability is more pronounced for on-the-wave than for off-the-wave IPO firms and the IPO price revision is not sensitive to the information revealed by concurrent IPOs. Using a difference-in-difference approach, we show that regions hosting IPO waves experience a parallel increase in several economic ratios post the wave. Overall, our results provide support to local IPO waves originating in positive local shocks. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",going-public decision; information spillover; IPO waves; local shock; underpricing,price dynamics; profitability; spillover effect
Is causality between globalization and energy consumption bidirectional or unidirectional in top and bottom globalized economies?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100352620&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2519&partnerID=40&md5=3b72b22cf2233446d49383f72e1561ef,"By using quarterly data over the period 1970Q1-2017Q4, this paper examines the dynamic causal relationship between globalization and energy consumption by using rolling and recursive rolling Granger causality methods. This study is pioneering effort to examine the dynamic causal relationship between globalization and energy consumption using time-varying Granger causality tests for 20 top and bottom globalized economies. The empirical results reveal that the dynamic causality relationship between globalization and energy consumption is time-varying. Although, the causal relationship could not be observed for some of the study periods, bidirectional causality is found in many sub-samples. From the empirical findings, we observe that unidirectional causality running from globalization to energy consumption has grievous impact on trade and environmental quality. In general, our empirical results resonate with the previous findings of globalization energy-driven hypothesis, with significant policy implications for top and bottom globalized countries. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Energy consumption; globalization; time-varying Granger causality,empirical analysis; energy use; environmental quality; globalization; Granger causality test
Corporate environmental disclosure and earnings management—The moderating role of corporate governance structures,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099991381&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2564&partnerID=40&md5=7167cdb7622ecfbafabb6d8f9db7e881,"Our study examines whether internal corporate governance (CG) mechanisms moderate the relationship between a firm's engagement in corporate environmental disclosure (CED) and earnings management (EM) practices in an emerging economy. Using a sample of 100 Jordanian listed firms from 2010 to 2014 (i.e., 500 firm-year observations), our findings reveal that while the relationship between CED and earnings manipulations is negative, the links between CG arrangements and EM are heterogeneous in that they might have either reduced or increased earnings manipulations in Jordan. Furthermore, some CG structures, such as board size, managerial, and institutional ownership structures have moderating effects on the CED-EM nexus. Our research highlights the significance of considering internal CG mechanisms to explain the link between CED and EM in the context of emerging economies. Our results help to explain and place into setting the earlier mixed results on the association between CED and earnings manipulations and most importantly add to the debate about whether CG structures detrimental to the CED-EM nexus. This study allows for a richer understanding of how managers respond to CED initiatives and CG reforms in relation to reducing earnings manipulations, which offers policymakers, board directors and managers, a set of context-specific recommendations related to the crucial need for more concerted efforts to ensure corporate sustainability in emerging economies. © 2021 The Authors.

Economic growth and club convergence: Is there a neighbour's effect?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100854682&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2545&partnerID=40&md5=ea3eabb96dc480fd32c957563b25dee4,"The study investigates economic growth and club convergence in a cross-country framework from 1970–1971 to 2014–2015. In particular, we test the club convergence hypothesis through a non-parametric and spatial interaction setting. The kernel density estimate shows a cyclical behaviour of per capita incomes, albeit following a common steady state. The conditional distribution is concentrated around the mean indicating a similar relative position across the heterogeneous countries. The transitional probabilities are strong enough to demonstrate a significant sign of clubbing. On testing the convergence hypothesis, we perceive strong evidence of club convergence across the countries. A persistent spatial dependence is unveiled across the proximities, therefore confirming the neighbour's effects in club formation. The study realizes a need to harmonize the interaction between the countries to improve the conditions for achieving long-run sustained economic growth. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",club convergence; economic growth; non-parametric distributional dynamics; spatial interaction,economic development; economic growth; financial market; financial services; spatial analysis; sustainability
The effects of environmental taxes on environmental pollution and unemployment: A panel co-integration analysis on the validity of double dividend hypothesis for selected African countries,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099807262&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2505&partnerID=40&md5=0924c7f8812cc0bc473768867c33102a,"In this study, the validity of the double dividend hypothesis for several African countries (Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Mali, South Africa, and Uganda) is investigated for the period of 1994–2017. The double dividend hypothesis claims that, in addition to reducing environmental pollution, environmental taxes can also increase employment. In this study, the validity of this hypothesis is examined with panel co-integration and long-run estimators. According to the findings obtained, environmental taxes increased environmental degradation and unemployment in Cameroon, environmental degradation in the Ivory coast, environmental degradation and employment in Mali, environmental restoration in South Africa and employment in Uganda. When the individual results obtained from the study are evaluated in general, it can be said that the double dividend hypothesis is not valid for African countries. The study proposes that taxation should be used as a financial incentive rather than a command-and-control policy to combat unemployment and environmental degradation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",African countries; double dividend; environmental degradation; environmental taxes; panel co-integration,Cameroon; Cote d'Ivoire; Mali; South Africa; Uganda; environmental degradation; environmental impact; environmental tax; pollution control; pollution effect; pollution policy; unemployment
Corporate social responsibility and supply chain: A study for evaluating corporate hypocrisy with special focus on stakeholders,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101046746&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2483&partnerID=40&md5=a45fc2029a23c8f3f0797b1a18f0bc0e,"Supply chains are intended to become the essential part of this global competitive world as organizations are seeking to formulate strategized advantages. To put it differently, most of the companies are aiming to adopt new businesses and raise the competition in the global market. For this, most of the companies or organizations are choosing strategies such as corporate social responsibility and supply chain management that allow the companies to ensure financial strengthening. Moreover, stakeholders and customers have raised their concerns towards corporate social responsibility with respect to global supply chain and ensured to act in a socially responsible way. It is believed that majority of the organizations are placing high importance on implementing corporate social responsibility or CSR activities in order to enhance the whole business. The active participation of companies in CSR activities will always benefit them in terms of profit, virtues and other moral standards. Usually, corporate firms exhibit their virtues ignoring the moral standard, which eventually reveals the nature of hypocrisy. Corporate hypocrisy is a context when companies or organizations assure the public to do something in corporate social responsibility context and end up doing entirely different. Keeping this in mind, the current study aims to reveal the hidden nature of corporate hypocrisy and its effect on inner stakeholders explicitly focusing on the employees' observations on corporate hypocrisy; examine the hypocritical behaviour of the reputed firms towards the consumers, which in turn affects the supply chain globally. For this, data analysis will be carried out with consumer firms across countries. Results show that firms are completely held responsible for their behaviour eventually defaming reputation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",corporate hypocrisy; corporate reputation; corporate social responsibility; global supply chains; organizational identification,competition (economics); corporate social responsibility; industrial practice; stakeholder; supply chain management
Stock co-movement and governance bundles: Does the quality of national governance moderate this relationship?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100476233&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2548&partnerID=40&md5=b526e8a2fb81b4419a6fb707ed85ef4e,"In this study, we examine if corporate governance, as a bundle, can better explain stock co-movement. To test the implication of governance bundles on stock co-movement, we consider a monitoring and incentive alignment bundle. Using 2,659 firm-year observations from 321 firms listed on the S&P 500 from 2009 to 2017, we find that the governance mechanism bundle can enhance the ability of stock prices to integrate better firm-specific information, which reflects on stock co-movement. In addition, we find the existence of a complementary relationship between National Governance Quality and a firm's board monitoring. This also helps in explaining the puzzle of stock co-movement. The findings will extend the understanding about the co-movement-related literature mentioned in the corporate governance and corporate finance research. The findings are also helpful for decision makers and policy makers involved in the efficient controlling of stock co-movement. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",board monitoring; governance bundle; incentive alignment; National Governance Quality; stock co-movement,firm ownership; governance approach; incentive; stock market
Effects of inflation uncertainty and exchange rate volatility on money demand in Pakistan: Bayesian econometric analysis,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101905671&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2488&partnerID=40&md5=8ded9021f41d541f44aed459062b115a,"The study explores determinants of money demand (M2) in a developing economy of Pakistan using annual data ranging 1976–2017. The study contributes by two ways. Firstly, it specifically examines the potential impact of exchange rate volatility and inflation uncertainty along with conventional determinants on money demand in Pakistan. Secondly, Bayesian Statistical inference is employed and the estimates are interpreted along with highest posterior density intervals (HPDI) with probability statements in order to cope with the issue of the instability of parameters. The analysis explores the positive impact of real income as well as share prices and the negative effect of interest rate on money demand as predicted by theory and earlier findings. Significant negative estimate of exchange rate shows that substitution effect overcomes wealth effect during exchange rate variations. But magnitude of exchange rate elasticity seems to depend upon strength of depreciation rate and/or future expectations, which may be considered an important research question for future work. Insignificance of exchange rate volatility for money demand in Pakistan is found which requires further research as to know about the behaviour of wealth effect and expectation effect during forex market uncertainty. Most importantly, inflation uncertainty is found to be a potential determinant of money demand in Pakistan. Rising uncertainty of inflation rate seems to have direct effects on precautionary and transaction motives of the demand for money. Findings of this study provides useful insights for policymaking in Pakistan as well as in other developing economies by suggesting inflation uncertainty as the potential determinant of money demand. Finally, Bayesian estimates along with HPDI estimates provide new information about the effects and particularly about the possible range of elasticities. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Bayesian inference; exchange rate volatility; inflation uncertainty; money demand; Pakistan,Pakistan; Bayesian analysis; currency; exchange rate; inflation; probability; uncertainty analysis
Do foreign lenders' national cultures affect loan pricing?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100254948&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2523&partnerID=40&md5=c1dfcff3f01efd863c5bac581b4c9c97,"We examine the role of foreign lenders' national cultures in the pricing of syndicated loans. Using Schwartz's cultural dimensions, embeddedness, and mastery, we find that foreign lenders domiciled in countries with higher embeddedness and mastery scores offer lower interest rates. These findings are robust to a battery of robustness tests and incremental to the effects of formal institutions. We also document that greater information asymmetry and foreign lenders' bargaining powers strengthen the impact of the foreign lenders' cultural values on loan pricing. An additional analysis shows that the intensity of loan covenants is also negatively related to the embeddedness and mastery scores of the foreign lenders' countries of domicile. Our findings suggest that cross-border debt contracting decisions are not only determined by objective judgments about risk and return but also depend on the subjective assertion of values and beliefs guided by informal institutions, such as cultural norms. Cultural values can nurture and shape economic incentives and perceptions of sophisticated professional bankers in increasingly globalized market settings, even when the financial stakes are substantial. © 2021 The Authors.

Going beyond the prior literature, our study aims to examine how the age diversity of audit committee financial experts (ACFEs) influences the financial reporting quality of Chinese non-financial firms. We found a negative relationship between ACFEs' age diversity and earning management. Our findings also show that younger ACFEs mitigate earnings management as compared to older ACFEs. We further examined this relationship among state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and privately owned enterprises in China and confirmed that the age diversity of ACFEs influences earnings management differently. However, younger ACFEs working in SOEs mitigates earnings management than their counterpart in privately owned companies. Our result maintains its robustness after controlling for endogeneity and employing a different measure of earnings management. Our result has relevance for selecting financial experts and the audit committee's overall composition, showing that including younger ACFEs will ensure more efficient control of firms' management. This finding is also relevant for policymakers, especially Chinese regulators, offering them insight into promoting audit committee effectiveness. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",age diversity; audit committee financial expertise; earnings management; older audit committee financial experts; younger audit committee financial experts,China; age structure; comparative study; finance; ownership; policy making; state owned enterprise

The results indicate that the estimated CARs for the industry groups and their sum on the event day were not statistically significant. Furthermore, the formal announcement of the first case of the COVID-19 in China had a negative but not significant impact on the Saudi stock market. In contrast, in the first 9-days event window, the announcement of the first confirmed case in Saudi Arabia had a negative and significant effect. Moreover, the most negatively affected industry groups were banks, consumer services, capital goods, transportation and commercial services, whereas telecommunication services and food and beverage were positively affected at the event window (+1, +9). In general, the Saudi stock market's response had become weaker in the event windows come after (+1, +9), and different industry groups were found to have different responses to the COVID-19 outbreak. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",abnormal returns; announcement date; industry group; stock market indices; Tadawul,China; Saudi Arabia; capital flow; COVID-19; disease incidence; economic impact; epidemic; industrial investment; pandemic; stock market; trade performance
Do Dow Jones Islamic equity indices undergo speculative pressure? New insights from a nonlinear and asymmetric analysis,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100950544&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2495&partnerID=40&md5=101a9d1a6b4d317c751b3ef518afccdb,"This paper study the exposure of Dow Jones Islamic equity indices to global risk factors while considering both effects of speculative influence and fundamental changes. The study involves future markets according to Shari'a guidelines that ban speculative trading. Nonlinear ARDL modelling approach along with dynamic asymmetric causality tests is conducted to scrutinize long-run and short-run asymmetries and asymmetric causalities. The used data are crude refined oil future prices to stand for fundamental chocks in speculative trading and implied volatility index to stand for speculative pressure. Obtained results approve the presence of asymmetric cointegration between Islamic equity indices and oil-VIX future prices. The Islamic indices are sensitive to oil-VIX future chocks both in the long run and the short run. Asymmetric causality tests indicate the existence of asymmetric causality running from crude refined oil future prices which confirm the fundamental contagion effects but the causality from VIX to Islamic indices is not pronounced at all. Results support the absence of speculative influence on Islamic indices and prove that DJIM indices corroborate with Shari'a compliant rules. In sum, the paper confirms the asymmetric cointegration and then assumes that the asymmetry is present in Islamic equity indices inherent to changes in international futures prices. The paper shows the structure of exposure to global markets' expectations and provides faith-based investors with insights about the attitude of Islamic indices towards the future. Our findings suggest useful highlights to policymakers, portfolio managers, faith-based investors and scholars. We then could state that if long-run relationship occurs it is naturally asymmetrical. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",asymmetric causality; Islamic finance; NARDL; oil futures price; VIX,equity; Islamism; oil industry; risk factor
The effect of financial sector development on economic growth of selected sub-Saharan Africa countries,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100894755&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2566&partnerID=40&md5=f01f44bf7cf719f6725f43d3fbb37aa7,"The effect of financial sector development on economic growth is among the main debatable issue in economics and policymaking. Thus, by using different financial sector dimensions, this research tried to look at the effect of financial sector development on the economic growth of 25 sub-Saharan Africa countries for the period 2010–2017. Precisely, three dynamic panel data models that look at the effect of financial sector depth, access, and efficiency on economic growth were estimated by two-step system GMM estimation. In this research, credit extended to the private sector per GDP, commercial bank branch per 100,000 adult population, and Return to assets were used as a proxy and measures for financial sector depth, access, and efficiency respectively. Accordingly, the results revealed that financial sector depth, access, and efficiency have a positive and statistically significant effect on these countries' economic growth. Therefore, it is recommended that the concerned bodies that broadening the depth of financial institutions by giving more credit to the private sector is essential. Besides, the financial institutions will have to be expanded to increase their accessibility to the mass and take some measures to promote their efficiency. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",economic growth; effect; financial sector access; financial sector depth; financial sector efficiency; sub-Saharan Africa; two-step system GMM,Sub-Saharan Africa; economic growth; efficiency measurement; financial market; financial services; numerical model; regional development
The role of oil and risk shocks in the high-frequency movements of the term structure of interest rates: Evidence from the U.S. Treasury market,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100569432&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2511&partnerID=40&md5=0d2792dd44237f988aead5e4108cb0e1,"We use daily data for the period 5 January 2000 to 31 October 2018 to analyse the impact of structural oil supply, oil demand and financial market risk shocks on the level, slope and curvature factors derived from the term structure of interest rates of the U.S. Treasury securities covering maturities of 1–30 years. Linear causality tests detect no evidence of predictability of these shocks on the three latent factors. However, statistical tests performed on the linear model provide evidence of structural breaks and nonlinearity, and hence indicate that the Granger causality test results are based on a misspecified framework, and cannot be relied upon. Given this, we use a nonparametric causality in-quantiles test to reconsider the predictive ability of the three shocks on the three latent factors, with this model being robust to misspecification due to regime changes and nonlinearity, as it is a data-driven approach. Moreover, this framework allows us to model the entire conditional distribution of the level, slope and curvature factors, and hence can accommodate, via the lower quantiles, the zero lower bound situation seen in our sample period. Using this robust model, we find overwhelming evidence of causality from the two oil shocks and the risk shock for the entire conditional distribution of the three factors, suggesting the predictability of the entire U.S. term structure based on information contained in oil and financial market innovations. Our results have important implications for academics, investors and policymakers. © 2021 The Authors.

Controlling shareholders' influence on acquisition decisions and value creation: An empirical study from China,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100761564&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2520&partnerID=40&md5=b8fc32510f81f45254ec0faa37449825,"Controlling shareholders are capable of influencing major decisions in firms, and their existence may give rise to principal-to-principal conflict as minority shareholders may feel sidelined during decision-making. This study employs a proxy (the highest control right), which takes into consideration both direct and indirect controls to investigate the excess cash usage preference of controlling shareholders. Again, the study investigates how the background characteristics of different controlling shareholders influence their underlying firms' acquisition decisions. With observations from 13,293 Chinese firms and the random effect probit model, we find that controlling shareholders are more likely to influence the use of excess cash into acquisition activities other than to retain such cash in the firm possibly for the payment of a dividend. Furthermore, we observe that the traditional way of classifying firms into either private or state is misleading, and the use of excess cash is influenced by the unique characteristics of the true owner. We recommend that on-going reforms in China should consider encouraging more institutional investors to acquire shares as this will reduce the powers of controlling owners. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",agency theory; china; controlling shareholder; firm value; merger and acquisition,China; decision making; empirical analysis; financial market; financial system; firm size; investment; merger; stakeholder

We consider an overall price index, three proxies of global oil shocks (overall, supply and demand) and non-oil (metal) price shocks and assess their causal relationships with the stock prices of a large set of heterogeneous countries in terms of development. Using a mixed-frequency VAR approach in a time-varying setting, we construct a Global Commodity Connectivity Index and a Global Stock Connectivity Index to monitor the prevalence, over time, of Granger-Causality from commodities to stock markets and vice versa. Our results show the existence of time-varying causality during the observed period depending on the level of country development and the position on the global commodity shocks super-cycles: the commodities depression of the 1980s and 1990s, the commodity boom of the 2000s and the post-Global Financial Crisis. © 2021 The Authors.

We subsequently use the rolling-window wavelet correlation framework of Polanco-Martínez et al. Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 2018, 490, 1211–1227 to investigate the dynamic relationship structure among global equity market fear and fear in alternative asset markets, namely oil (OVX), gold (GVZ), currency (EVZ), and bond (TYNVI). We find that OVX drives the underlying VIX connectedness of the global equity markets during stress periods. The results also suggest the prospects of a reverse hedge that is driven by GVZ when the demand for gold intensifies. Furthermore, there are structural shifts in EVZ following Brexit, highlighting a negative relationship with the VIX connectedness. Finally, we find that the VIX connectedness typically moves in the opposite direction to the TYNVI. These results are insightful in realizing vulnerable stock markets' behaviour and explaining investors' sentiments and their shifts over time in asset allocations. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",alternative assets; fear connectedness; rolling window wavelet coherence; time-frequency domain,econometrics; financial market; frequency analysis; investment; stock market; wavelet analysis

Gravity assessment of the impact of alliances on bilateral trade: A comparative analysis of ECOMOG and NATO,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100348836&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2518&partnerID=40&md5=0d72981a749a2e32ed4913242512beb1,"The prevailing notion for this research is anchored on determining the magnitude of alliances as trade determinants. Alliances are segregated into defence pact, non-aggressive alliance and entente, which additionally integrates as trade cost in a gravity model. The Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood technique is adopted for the analysis with country pair-effects exploited. Even though literature acknowledged three different kinds of alliance formation, the homogenous effects as trade cost have not been previously examined. Authors found that alliances' response to bilateral trade is homogenous irrespective of conceptualization and operationalism. All categories of alliance positively influence bilateral trade but could be more effective as trade determinant when rooted in a regional trade agreement. The result is more convincing in the NATO sample than the ECOWAS sample, which could not be unconnected with the level of economic and technological development in both cases.

An analysis of Conventional and Alternative financing—Customers' perspective,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100493811&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2541&partnerID=40&md5=95db5a7731ee55882bc095a556a08cc9,"Alternative financing is a phenomenon that has been gaining momentum since the last decade. It is a way of dealing with financial requirements on an online platform with or without the intervention of a third party. In India, Banking and Financial Services are moving from the traditional “one size fits all” approach to a more personalized service approach, with the help of financial technology. However, it is important to understand that the growth of any sector, especially the service sector depends upon the user's experience and their perception of the service. A better understanding of customer's perceptions and their experience can help financial organizations to strategize better in order to increase their market share and profitability. In this connection, this study aims at understanding the customer's adaptability, awareness, and perceived ease of use of Alternative Financing with reference to conventional financing. Primary as well as secondary data are collected for this purpose. The primary data were obtained from self-administered questionnaire. Factor analysis is conducted to explore the factors, which contribute to the better involvement of customers towards Alternative Finance. This study tries to make an original contribution by assessing significant factors that prompt a customer to use alternative financial services. Results indicate a significant positive relationship between the factors and the growth of alternative finance. The results may help financial institutions to design the products and increased the use of IT in their operations to achieve the objectives. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Alternative finance; Awareness; Conventional finance; Customer's perception; FinTech,India; banking; factor analysis; financial services; financial system; perception; profitability; questionnaire survey
Kidnapping rate and capital flight: Empirical evidence from developing countries,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100176732&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2551&partnerID=40&md5=7edd171926d912724c778a0f6ef51293,"This paper contributes to the literature on capital flight by investigating the relationship between kidnapping rate and capital flight in developing countries. Numerous empirical studies exist on the determinants of capital flight but, surprisingly, none of them have investigated the empirical link between kidnapping and capital flight. To fill this existing void in the literature, this paper utilised a sample of 67 developing countries for the period 2003–2017. Estimates of the GMM technique show that kidnapping rate has a positive and significant impact on capital flight. However, estimations of the marginal differences show that this significant effect remained consistent only in the sample of ‘fragile’ developing countries. The results remained consistent to alternative measures of capital flight. © 2021 The Authors.

The richness of the patterns associated with such fluctuations presents considerable challenges to the theory of crises as well as the policies targeting various tendencies induced by crises. Dealing with complexly interwoven unstable, suboptimal and potentially chaotic tendencies is not an easy task, which may require new combinations of methods analysing the causal connections and feedback relations embedded in the web of relations characterizing the crisis-junctures. In this paper, we develop an illustrative dynamic model that takes into account such causally connected feedback relations so as to construct and simulate stochastic policy options, which can influence and help stabilize unstable, suboptimal and chaotic trajectories of exchange rates at financial crisis junctures. For reasons of convenience and practical relevance, we exemplified such policies using taxes. One of the constructed examples makes use a stochastic taxing policy to influence the coefficient of adjustment, which influences the amount of adjustments and hence fluctuations in the market. We incorporate a software-based optimization setup into the simulation model to find the optimal values of the policy parameter to be used for the purpose of simulating the trajectories of the exchange rates. It turns out that the suggested policies could influence/reduce the fluctuations in the market and hence help stabilize unstable or chaotic exchange rate trajectories. The second example in the paper is concerned with an empirical case relating to a particular financial crisis juncture of Turkey during May–November 2018. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",chaos; crisis; instability; stability,Turkey; chaos theory; crisis management; exchange rate; financial crisis; financial market; financial services; instability; tax system

Gender diversity of boards and executives on real earnings management in the bull or bear period: Empirical evidence from China,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101097816&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2562&partnerID=40&md5=7a0a12d1c22a5c135cf2a442d0d89f85,"This study investigates whether gender diversity in the roles of executives, boards of supervisors and management impacts real earnings management during the bullish and bearish periods from 2000 to 2017. The sample is separated by bullish (11,616 firm-year observations) and bearish (14,436 firm-year observations) periods. The results suggest that female participation on supervisory boards and executives tend to kerb real earnings management during bearish and bullish periods. Another important finding is that female CEOs are more cautious in real earnings manipulation due to their risk-averse nature during the bearish period, while female CFOs are more likely to constrain real earnings management in the bullish period. This study failed to find the relation of gender diversity on boards of management to real earnings management; however, the study has found that female executives (excluding CEOs and CFOs) who are also directors are more likely to limit earnings manipulation. © 2021 The Authors.

Despite being less productive efficient, GLCs' operation benefits from scale economies tied to the resource sector: its profitability is procyclical to commodity shocks. The model is estimated to Malaysia using the Bayesian approach, with the results suggesting a business cycle heavily influenced by resource shocks. Based on this, we solve numerically for a socially optimal combination of excess resource savings allocation. We find the present allocation to be sub-optimal, regardless of the structural shocks. This suggests that the Malaysian economy might have hit its absorptive capacity constraint (i.e., a domestic economy saturated by GLCs). © 2021 The Authors.

Also, we find that firms with more growth opportunities, larger size, low profitability, and higher ownership concentrations prefer to issue convertible bonds rather than bonds with warrants.

To account for the temporal volatility in the event approach, the study resort to a GARCH model. Empirical findings suggest that January 23, 2020 event (first case of death due to Covid-19 in China) have had a minor impact on the WAEMU stock market while the event on March 2, 2020 (first case of Covid-19 in the WAEMU) strongly affected the financial market. This negative impact is much more pronounced for the distribution sectors (−34.16%). Robustness analysis reveals that the main information leading to disruption on the market is the weekly death cases and not the confirmed cases. In addition, government anti-Covid-19 measures such as social distancing and governance positively affect the stock return whereas lockdown, public health measures and movement restrictions contribute to a decline in the stock's price. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",BRVM; Covid-19; stocks; WAEMU; Wilcoxon signed ranks test,West Africa; COVID-19; economic impact; empirical analysis; financial market; monetary union; public health; stock market

The true effects of circuit breakers, however, remain controversial. We investigate four circuit-breaker triggering events in early 2016 in China's A-share market to examine the magnet effects of market-wide circuit breakers. By performing more than 150,000 logit regressions on more than 30 million observations obtained from firm-level tick-by-tick trading data, we find that the prices of A-shares tend to fall further when the market approaches its downward breaker limits, which is consistent with the magnet effects hypothesis. The second layer of the breaker, which halts all trading for the rest of the day, induces larger magnet effects than the first layer, which suspends trading for 15 minutes. Our results remain robust after controlling for the potential magnet effects of firm-specific price limits and the intraday momentum effects of positive feedback trading. Stocks with higher risk, higher attention, and lower liquidity are significantly more affected by magnet effects, while constituent stocks of the CSI 300, the designated benchmark market index of circuit breakers, are insignificantly less affected. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",assets pricing; circuit breakers; electronic order-driven market; magnet effects; market microstructure,China; benchmarking; market conditions; price dynamics; regression analysis; stock market; trade flow

Standard mathematical formulas do not exist for determining credit ratings. Instead, rating agencies exercise their judgment and use their experience to determine what information is to be important in providing a rating. Thus, knowledge and understanding about factors influencing credit ratings is very crucial for companies being rated and other users. Most of the prior studies in related context have used developed countries' data, and the effect in emerging markets, especially in Indian context, is still unclear due to lack of such studies. So, this study attempts to identify the long-term and short-term financial determinants of credit ratings issued to Indian companies and examines their impact on credit ratings on the basis of panel data and cross-sectional approaches. Ordered probit analysis is used with credit ratings as the dependent variable and six financial factors as the independent variables. Results indicate that size, profitability and leverage have a significant relationship with corporate credit ratings in both panel data and cross-sectional approaches. Also, size has the highest impact on credit ratings followed by leverage and profitability in both the approaches. The major contribution of present study is that two different mathematical models are framed which have a reasonably well correct prediction percentage. These models can be used by the investors' academicians, practitioners and other users for predicting the rating categories of various companies and to get a fair idea about their creditworthiness and safety. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",CARE; corporate credit rating; CRISIL; financial determinants; ICRA; ordered probit analysis,India; credit provision; numerical model; panel data; profitability

However, this study showed that in the critical situations the PPP theory, which adopts a long-term and backward-looking approach, no longer works, and instead the market tends to adopt a short-term and prospective approach to exchange rates. In this study, the economic data of Iran and the United States were gathered from late 1978 to 21 September 2018, and by adding three other economic factors, including the difference of average annual growth rate of GDP per capita of 2% between the two countries, indicator of risk in low volatility period (1.16%) and high volatility one (1.49%), a new and risk-based approach is presented based on the low and high volatility of the exchange rates to address the excessive changes not explained by conventional theories. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",annual growth rate of GDP per capita; high volatility period; low volatility period; monetary behaviour theory; purchasing power parity theory,Iran; United States; currency; exchange rate; financial market; Gross Domestic Product; growth rate; inflation; purchasing power parity

Analysis of Markov regime-switching results demonstrate that MSCI Asia is a good indicator for China's CDS spread during tranquil state while gold is a more relevant predictor in the turbulent state. Our results further indicate that domestic variables determine China's CDS spread better than global variables during crisis period.

An empirical investigation of the relationship between brand value and firm value: Evidence from Turkey,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178469510&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2915&partnerID=40&md5=ed16dbad1a55e1af7eaa8e130c5f762d,"This paper aims to investigate the relationship between brand value and firm value by using a two-step approach. In the first step, we use the financial-based brand valuation model (FBVEM) to obtain the brand value of firms that operated in the Turkish manufacturing industry during the period between 2014 and 2018. In the second step, we examine the effect of brand value on Tobin's Q. In doing so, we use a novel GMM, with a measurement errors model, which takes into account mismeasurements of the financial variables.

Carbon emission trading under the wings of black swans and green swans: Evidence from China,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174569159&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2904&partnerID=40&md5=3bcf7e8ff4b40c85a693c1acb44f733d,"In response to the potential green swans event in the future, China is adopting market-oriented means to encourage green development, specifically through carbon emission trading schemes. At the same time, under the outbreak of the current global pandemic, it is equally important to consider the impact of black swan events. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the fluctuations in carbon emission trading prices under green and black swan events by utilizing daily data from seven carbon emission exchanges in China from 2017 to 2020. The analysis includes the construction of multiple regression models, PVAR models, and panel threshold models. Additionally, the study addresses the endogeneity problem by using instrumental variables. The findings of the study indicate that: (1) Rising temperatures will drive up the carbon emissions trading price, and this impact will persist over time. On the other hand, increased humidity levels and sunshine hours will reduce the carbon emissions trading price. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between the increase in the price of primary energy and the increase in the carbon emissions trading price. (2) The spread of COVID-19 has a restraining effect on the increase in temperature and will have a long-term negative impact on the carbon emissions trading price. (3) The threshold effect concerning the prevalence of pandemics is recognized, which implies that the impact of the epidemic is staged and nonlinear. Overall, the results of this article highlight the importance of a reasonable response to both black swan and green swan events in order to enhance the efficiency of the current emission trading scheme. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",carbon emission trading; climate change; COVID-19; green development; panel threshold model; PVAR,

The findings reveal that (a) there is a significant vulnerability in NPLs and EG over the selected period at different frequency levels; (b) EG in Turkey has a strong power for explaining NPLs in the long-run; (c) EG causes NPLs in Turkey in the short-term between 2007 and 2010, which implies that the credit growth in the period with the increasing NPLs supports EG of Turkey. The outcomes of the tests underline the importance of EG for predicting NPLs in Turkey. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",EG; NPLs; Turkey; wavelet coherence approach,Turkey; economic growth; financial crisis; financial market; financial services; prediction; wavelet analysis
Does market power explain margins in dual banking?

To this end, we employ panel quantile regression (QR) to a sample of Islamic and conventional banks from 14 dual banking countries during 2005–2018. Our empirical findings show that greater market power in a dual banking system results in a higher net interest margin, which is in line with the mainstream theory of monopolistic competition. After introducing the Islamic interaction dummy in the model, we find that in the case of Islamic banks the result is significant only for higher quantiles of bank margins. This study also has some policy implications, namely that the concentration of market power can be countered by developing a competitive environment among the banks to have competitive bank margins. We further suggest that to get a higher profit margin, Islamic banks need to be more competitive and more efficient while deciding the profit margins. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bank margins; dual banking; Islamic banks; Lerner; market power; quantile regression,banking; competition (economics); empirical analysis; monopoly; panel data; regression analysis

Using a panel data of 120 economies during 1996–2016, this paper aims to examine the impact of financial openness, human capital, institutional quality, banking industry concentration, and other factors on economic complexity. We establish dynamic panel models that incorporate lagged-dependent variables and employ the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) for estimation. Our pooled-sample regression results show that the enhancement of overall financial openness could increase the economic complexity significantly, as well as de-facto and de-jure openness. The subsample regressions indicate heterogeneous impacts of financial openness depending on country groups and industry. Besides, there exists significant path dependence for ECI improvement, which is more prominent in high-income countries. For low- and middle-income countries, greater GVC participation and lower banking concentration can promote ECI improvement significantly. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",economic complexity; financial openness; GMM estimation; panel data,banking; complexity; developing world; economic impact; financial market; financial system; panel data

Based on an unbalanced panel of data constructed by 36 banks in Malaysia from 2006 to 2020, this study examines the impact of financial technology on banks' stability and efficiency. We find that, compared with Islamic banks, FinTech innovation significantly improves the stability of commercial banks. Additionally, it improves the entire sample banks' efficiency calculated by the data envelopment analysis-Malmquist method, which can capture the efficiency changes from a dynamic perspective. These baseline results are affirmed by the generalized method of moment approach to mitigate potential endogeneity issues. Furthermore, the impacts of FinTech innovation on banks are heterogeneous. The high-profit banks enjoy the benefits of improving their stability level from FinTech development. However, for the small-sized and low-profit banks, FinTech innovation contributes more to improving their efficiency. Our analysis provides empirical evidence for Malaysia and similar developing countries that are receptive to FinTech development but have relatively less advanced technology infrastructure. It can also shed light on the FinTech investment decisions of bank management. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",DEA-Malmquist; efficiency; FinTech innovation; risk-taking; stability,

This study undertakes an investment criteria investigation of institutional investors in Turkiye. The sample covers real and financial sector companies to investigate sectoral differences in Borsa Istanbul-listed firms for 2010–2021. Using a panel data approach, we show that the presence of growth options, generous payout policy, attractive firm valuation, and quality of the external governance mechanisms are important factors in attracting institutional investors by real sector firms. Only a large firm size and the quality of the external governance mechanisms arise as important factors for financial sector firms. Moreover, institutional holdings positively impact the percentage shares of institutional investors during crisis periods among real sector firms, whereas they do not affect financial sector firms. Real-sector and financial-sector firms can use our findings to increase institutional ownership.

Corporate price dynamics during and after the COVID-19 pandemic: Insights from a partial equilibrium model,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173637524&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2899&partnerID=40&md5=b34b44bbd5b3ca8f3263de835397d7fe,"The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented demand and supply shock to the world economies. To understand its impact on corporate prices, we define a partial equilibrium model where non-financial corporations operating in three sectors (suppliers, end-producers and service providers) optimize their production under monopolistic competition and are subject to demand and supply shocks of different intensities. Our model confirms that when the demand shock dominates, prices tend to decrease. We then introduce data from the COVID-19 pandemic in the European Union into our model and find that prices are expected to fall in the most acute phase of the pandemic, when lockdowns and similar health measures decrease demand, and to increase later as a result of tensions in the supply of intermediate goods and of the persistence of the supply shock. Inventories could play a decisive role in avoiding price increases in the moderate phase of the pandemic. In the post-pandemic period, higher prices may continue for a time until the shock to suppliers vanishes. These are relevant insights on the macroeconomic impact of worldwide pandemics, also considering the current macroeconomic environment. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",demand shock; pandemic; prices; production function; supply chain; supply shock,

We also find that, throughout the sample period, inter-firm linkages are two and a half times as important as the direct effect of firm shocks in driving aggregate fluctuations.

We test this hypothesis on a sample of 6500 loans issued to European firms between 1999 and 2017. We find that the use of a stronger FTR language decreases the likelihood of renegotiation and the number of renegotiation rounds. These findings are robust to several FTR proxies, various specifications including loan, borrower, and country-level variables, and potential mitigation effects from specific loan, country, or time effects. They suggest that linguistic structure influences the renegotiation process of private debt contracts. © 2023 The Authors.

Apart from that, findings show the long-term role of ICE in bank stability, although statistics depict no short-term role in this regard. The efficiency ratios, risk-based capital, leverage, and bank size shows a positive impact in the short run. In the long run, the risk-based capital and leverage show a decisively positive influence, while the bank size and efficiency ratio show a negative effect.

Our sample includes 37,938 firm-month observations from 488 non-financial firms from October 2008 to February 2021. We employ Fama and MacBeth regressions and portfolio analysis methodologies to estimate the impact of intangible assets and financial constraints on stock returns. Our findings show that a percentage increase in INTANG empowers stock returns by 0.922%. Meanwhile, the cross-sectional stock returns decrease by 0.506% when the financial constraints index increases by a percentage point. Moreover, the results suggest that intangible assets in the entire sample and before COVID-19 empower the stock return cross-sectionally.

Using econometric models, we analysed the relationship between the evolution of the net FDI inflows and a number of statistical indicators. Our findings proved that there are similarities between the countries analysed, in terms of the evolution of net FDI inflows, with some differences being recorded for Hungary, where the evolution of net FDI inflows has major fluctuations. We found that the countries present both similarities and differences in terms of variables that affect FDI. The FDI net inflows (% GDP) are in seven, out of nine economies, positively influenced by GDP, as it follows: Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovenia are FDI attractive by an increasing GDP rate, while Latvia, Poland and Romania react to a better GDP per capita. Hungary is the only one that is positively influenced by both GDP rate and GDP per capita. Moreover, a decreasing corruption perception index, country risk rating, income tax (% of commercial profit) and other taxes paid by companies (% commercial profit) can positively influence the inflows of FDIs in some of the analysed countries. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",corruption perception index; country risk rating; economic development; economic freedom index; foreign direct investment,Europe; corruption; economic development; European Union; foreign direct investment; Gross Domestic Product; perception; socioeconomic indicator
Excessive focus on risk?

While the existing literature tends to explain that the high operating costs arise from the provision of small loans, we argue that excessive efforts to control loan losses can also be a contributing factor. Therefore, this article investigates the relationship between NPLs and the cost efficiency of microfinance institutions (MFIs). Using a unique global sample of rated MFIs and applying stochastic frontier analysis together with Granger-causality test and generalized method of moments (GMM), we find, in contrast to positive linear relationship evidence in commercial banking studies, a nonlinear (U-shape) relationship between operating costs and NPLs. This implies that MFIs need to balance their cost efficiency with asset quality. © 2021 The Authors.

Taking China as an example, the paper tests dynamic causality between PPI and CPI during the period of 2000:M1-2019:M12. In view of structural mutations in time series variables, the bootstrap rolling-window causality test is applied to restudy the dynamic causal relationship. As a result, it exists bidirectional transmission mechanism between CPI and PPI, both positive transmission of PPI to CPI and reverse transmission of CPI to PPI. In addition to putting more emphasis on transmission mechanism and causality between PPI and CPI, formulation of macroeconomic policy needs to focus on the correlation between PPI and CPI, and then the government can implement more targeted measures, such as strengthening the comprehensive application of monetary policy and fiscal policy, further deepening the supply-side reform, optimizing the industrial structure to strengthen internal relationship between CPI and PPI. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bootstrap; CPI; dynamic causality; PPI; rolling window,China; bootstrapping; economic policy; macroeconomics; price determination; price dynamics; time series

The empirical findings demonstrate substantial difference in the dynamic responses of capital structure under the conditions of shocks given to its key determinants, with and without financial flexibility. Debt ratio of financially flexible firms reacts positively to asset tangibility and size whereas it reacts negatively to growth opportunity, non-debt tax shield and profitability.

In our sample of 99 countries over the period 1975–2020, increased activity of banks relative to markets in the provision of financial services is robustly associated with less inequality in the developing world yet with more inequality in developed economies. Accounting for redistribution systems does not alter this finding; banking sector concentration amplifies the effects. Results suggest that banks work at the extensive margin at earlier stages of economic development yet shift to the intensive margin at higher levels of development, where they increasingly serve the interests of the rich.

Does the quality of country-level governance have an impact on corporate environmental disclosure? Evidence from Gulf Cooperation Council countries,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099902502&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2469&partnerID=40&md5=5fb33f6362223d6fa29fc1bf497b381c,"Despite the growth in corporate environmental disclosure (CED) across the world, there remains considerable heterogeneity in the extent to which firms disclose their environmental impacts. To better understand these changes and variations, we identify possible macro-level determinants of CED. Drawing on institutional theory, we examine the influence of country-level governance (CLG) upon CED amongst the non-financial sectors in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Descriptive findings obtained using a cross-country sample of 500 firm-year observations suggest that CED is still in its infancy in the region. Nevertheless, the data confirm an increasing trend in environmental information published in GCC companies' annual reports, but with notable differences between countries. Using measures derived from the World Governance Index (WGI), we examine the extent to which three CLG factors – voice and accountability (VA), government effectiveness (GE) and control of corruption (CC) – explain the patterns observed. We employ a panel data approach with various robustness checks and find that the association of VA with CED is insignificant or significantly positive, depending on the statistical method used, whereas GE is positively related to CED, and CC is – contrary to our expectation – negatively associated with CED. Our study contributes to the literature by providing a picture of CED in the GCC region and adding to the understanding of macro-level determinants of CED.

Co-movement of foreign exchange rate returns and stock market returns in an emerging market: Evidence from the wavelet coherence approach,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099946885&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2522&partnerID=40&md5=08635642f32d2f793255ba7f6be59780,"This study aims to investigate the causal relationship between the Turkish stock market returns, namely XU100, and foreign exchange rates, namely USD/TRY and EUR/TRY, in Turkey using the wavelet coherence approach. In this study, we focus on the period from April 2000 to March 2019. Our findings reveal the following: (i) While we identify substantial volatility in the exchange rate during the 2000 November (banking crisis), 2001 February (economic crisis), and 2018 July (exchange rate crisis) periods, significant volatility was observed in the Turkish stock market during the 2000 banking crisis, 2001 economic crisis, and 2008 global crisis periods; (ii) There is a negative correlation between the Turkish stock market and foreign exchange rates at different frequencies over the selected sample period; (iii) A unidirectional causality runs from the Turkish stock market to foreign exchange rates between 2000 and 2004 at a scale of 4 months and between 2008 and 2012 at a scale of 32 months; (iv) Although inconsistent results are observed for the models of USD/TRY-XU100 and EUR/TRY-XU100, our empirical results show that the correlations between USD/TRY and XU100 are stronger than between EUR/TRY and XU100. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",emerging market; exchange rate; stock market; Turkey; wavelet coherence,Turkey; banking; correlation; empirical analysis; exchange rate; financial crisis; stock market
Institutional quality and social cost of intermediation in Africa: Does the level of financial market development matter?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100097078&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2515&partnerID=40&md5=a4131e7a69bb7b67c28d6e66cc574699,"This article examines the effect of institutional quality on social cost of intermediation in high and low developed financial markets across 29 African countries between 2006 and 2013. Employing bootstrap-quantile and two-step system generalized methods of moments models with bank level data of about 330 banks, the results provide interesting and new insights. The results show that improvement in institutional quality in high or low developed financial markets translates into reduced social cost of intermediation to the society. However, it is evident from the results that improvement in institutional quality is more robust, persistent and weightier in reducing the social cost of intermediation in low developed financial markets which are often characterized with weak regulatory regimes and enforcement. Hence, improvement in institutional quality shores up regulatory supervision, monitoring and enforcement which translates into heavier dampening of social cost of financial intermediation in less developed financial markets. Moreover, bank size, credit shocks, return on equity and liquidity are key drives of social cost of intermediation both in low and high developed financial markets. These findings have policy implications and recommendations for policymakers and regulators of financial institutions. Policymakers and regulators, especially those in less developed financial markets, must endeavour to create, implement and advance mechanisms and enabling environment that enhances the quality of institutions since improved institutional quality reduces social cost of intermediation to the benefit of society. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Africa; financial development; institutional quality; social cost of intermediation,Africa; cost; financial market; industrial regulation; market development; organization
Analysis of default risk in microfinance institutions under the Basel III framework,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099996139&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2475&partnerID=40&md5=85db9f69cc9f2bc56a3948c852b74604,"International organizations such as OECD, WBG, IMF, UN and EU, as well as research studies, have highlighted the increasing contribution being made by microcredit finance institutions (MFIs) to financial inclusion, sustainable economic development and the fight against poverty. However, access to MFI credit is still far from the desired level for small and micro-enterprises, especially in developing countries. The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, where approximately half of the small formal companies do not have access to credit, have the world's highest financial gap ratio compared to potential demand (87%). In this context, effective instruments are needed to assess default risk, through credit ratings. Based on the Basel III regulations, an empirical study was conducted of two microcredit portfolios corresponding to two MFIs in two Latin American countries (Bolivia and Colombia) during the period 2012–2015, to identify the explanatory variables of the probability of default on loans granted by MFIs, using a logistic regression model and a neural network. The results obtained show that the main variables in this respect are the amount of the loan, the number of payments in arrears, the guarantees provided, the assessment of the credit analyst, male gender of the borrower and the level and trend of the general stock exchange index. The conclusions presented advance previous research findings and may be useful for MFI managers, regulatory institutions, financial analysts, scholars, policy-makers and applicants for microcredits to undertake a business project, especially in times of emerging crisis, such as that caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Artificial neural networks; Basel III; default; logistic regression; microfinance institutions,Caribbean Islands; Latin America; artificial neural network; financial crisis; financial market; institutional framework; microfinance; regression analysis
Economic policy uncertainty and access to finance: An international evidence,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174860730&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2898&partnerID=40&md5=c73cc896a567a056e17eadbfcb3840a1,"In this study, we provide the first attempt to relate economic policy uncertainty (EPU) to firms' access to finance. Using data from 26 countries and the news-based index from Baker et al. (2016), we provide evidence that EPU significantly increases financial constraints and decreases firms' access to finance. Our main inference is robust to alternative measures of financial constraints, alternative samples, alternative model specifications, and several approaches that control for potential endogeneity. We further show that the EPU-financial constraint relationship is driven by both the demand and supply sides of financing. Additional analyses suggest that the impact of EPU on firms' financial constraints is moderated by board characteristics (i.e., gender diversity, independence, and duality). They also highlight the moderating roles of government effectiveness, the rule of law and control of corruption. Collectively, our findings provide novel theoretical and practical contributions in relation to EPU and the firms' setting. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",access to finance; board characteristics; capital structure; economic policy uncertainty; financial constraints; macro-economics,
Time-varying causality between investor sentiment an oil price: Does uncertainty matter?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179314218&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2922&partnerID=40&md5=560c05363770f5a0ddd915f7c647192d,"While the oil market-investors sentiment (IS) has been considerably investigated, almost all studies have focused on the assumption of a constant relationship, and no attention has been given to the causality analysis in a time-varying approach. To fill this gap, this study investigates the predictive power between IS and oil price based on a time-varying Granger causality test. Using data over the period 1987–2020, we find evidence of significant bidirectional asymmetric time-varying causal influences between investor sentiment and oil prices, suggesting that oil prices may predict investor sentiment and vice versa. Besides, the results suggest that bearish (bullish) investor sentiment has positive (negative) influences on oil prices during major economic and political events. In contrast, oil price exerts an influence on the sentiment which switches between positive and negative from one period to another. Further analysis shows that uncertainty related to the oil and equity markets can be a driver of the predictive power of oil prices on the bearish IS. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",bearish investor sentiment; bullish investor sentiment; oil price; time-varying causality; uncertainty,
How do credit ratings affect corporate investment efficiency?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179316876&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2920&partnerID=40&md5=6e9e1facc369d7268528de88c57a7f72,"This study examines the impact of credit ratings on the efficiency of firms' investments. Using a large sample of US firms, we find a positive relationship between the existence of credit ratings and investment efficiency. The cross-sectional analyses show the positive relationship is more pronounced for firms with greater information asymmetry and weaker corporate governance. Our results are robust to different methods to address potential endogeneity concerns, alternative measures of key variables, and the inclusion of additional control variables. Overall, the findings support the notion that credit rating agencies enhance information transparency and external monitoring, thereby allowing rated firms to promote investment efficiency. The findings contribute to our understanding of the significant role played by credit rating agencies in shaping firms' investment behaviour and efficiency. © 2023 The Authors.

Can economic links explain lead–lag relations across firms?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100115849&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2480&partnerID=40&md5=6be75c5d64768e73190d9ebccca481c0,"This article studies the driving sources of cross-firm lead–lag relations in returns which are generated by the Granger-causality test with a long estimation window. The authors observed that economic links such as customer–supplier relationships and peer effects only account for a small share of the frequently observed cross-firm lead–lag relations. Instead, most of the cross-firm lead–lag relations are driven by several classical factors. On average, 95% of the cross-firm lead–lag relations disappear after controlling for the three classical Fama–French factors, “betting against beta” and a few industry factors such as utility, oil, construction, and finance. This article represents novel evidence that classical factors designed for explaining the contemporaneous stock returns also contains important information for future returns. Investors trading on the signals generated by the relevant classical factors can obtain significant and positive returns. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",classical factors; economic links; lead–lag relations; return predictability,estimation method; Granger causality test; investment
Do forward premium rates predict the spot rates?

The data comprises of developing and developed 16 countries' currencies of daily spot rates and forward premium rates of 30, 90, 180 and 360 days by extending the work of Della Corte, Sarno and Tsiakas (2009). The study proposes the model of predictable time series in nature to test for the heteroscedasticity in respective categories of forward premium rates, for example, heteroscedastic forward premium model (H-FPM). The results are encouraging and support that forward premiums have information that can be possibly utilized by investors for generating profits. Moreover, the predictive time series model observes that there exists a degree of concordance in results from in-sample and out-of-sample (OOS_R2) statistical tests. The study finds that the (H-FPM) dominates the symmetric-mean model (S-MM) and thus promises more profit incentivised benefits for investors.

Behavioural explanations of Expectile VaR forecasting and dynamic hedging strategies for downside risk during the COVID-19 pandemic: Insights from financial markets,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176111473&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2902&partnerID=40&md5=119d4882854bb0e6995f62c58c458833,"In this paper, we investigate the influence of confirmation bias on Expectile Value at Risk (EVaR) forecasting among fundamentalist, optimistic, and pessimistic investors in cryptocurrency, commodity, and stock markets before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing the DCC-range GARCH model, we also explore the conditional minimum downside risk hedge ratios. Our findings demonstrate that confirmation bias leads to excessive EVaR for financial market returns, regardless of the period being before or during COVID-19. Moreover, fundamentalists' expectations in all markets remain constant, while without confirmation bias, optimists' and pessimists' expectations tend to converge to zero over time but diverge significantly during turbulent periods. When confirmation bias is present, the average distance between these expectations widens. Analysing the hedge ratio results, with or without confirmation bias, also unveils the conditional minimum downside risk hedge ratios. These ratios indicate the optimal proportions for hedging downside risk in each financial market during different periods. We find that the conditional minimum downside risk hedge ratios are generally lower (higher) during the pre-COVID-19 (COVID-19) period, implying that hedging costs are higher during the COVID-19 period. These insightful findings offer valuable insights for traders and regulators in identifying and understanding the risk conditions of cryptocurrency, commodity, and stock markets. Additionally, the analysis of conditional minimum downside risk hedge ratios provides investors with essential information on how to strategically position their portfolios to mitigate and manage risk during both tranquil and turbulent market conditions, with and without confirmation bias. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",commodities; confirmation bias; COVID-19; cryptocurrencies; Expectile VaR (EVaR); financial market stochastic model; range DCC-GARCH; stocks; time varying hedging,
"Life insurance consumption across generations: The roles of financial knowledge, planning horizon, and self-control",2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174625571&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2903&partnerID=40&md5=99c226336fcfc9919c69a48b8d12f835,"Life insurance enhances households' capacity to absorb financial shocks and protects against personal risks that no one likes to contemplate. This is even more important in times of economic hardship such as now, when many Europe countries and particularly Spain are going through difficult times due to rising inflation, the war in Ukraine, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although previous studies have analysed the driving forces of life insurance demand, the influence of the individual's financial planning horizon, financial knowledge, and financial self-control have been underexplored. This study analyses the influence of personal financial attributes on life insurance demand and, in so doing, explores whether the effects of such attitudes differ across different generational cohorts (i.e., the silent generation, baby boomers, Gen Xers, and millennials). The data, taken from the Survey of Financial Competences, comprises 7245 Spanish individuals. Evidence from multivariate analyses reflects the relevance of standard sociodemographic characteristics in explaining individuals' decisions to become life insurance holders. In contrast, evidence does not support a statistically significant relationship in the case of behavioural variables such as financial self-control and the financial planning horizon. © 2023 The Authors.

Moreover, we find differences in the factors affecting net and gross capital flows, which are usually more closely related to earnings factors dominated by real economic growth rates. Additionally, the sample's heterogeneity is analysed in accordance with the exchange rate regimes. Our results differ from traditional views, as floating exchange rates do not act as a buffer against extreme capital flows. Finally, capital flows are classified into direct investment, other investment, and portfolio investment, and it is found that U.S. economic uncertainty shocks have a significant impact on the extreme flow episodes of other and portfolio investment. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",emerging and developing economies; exchange rate regime; extreme capital flows; panel logit model; RR classification; U.S. economic uncertainty shocks,

Using monthly data for the period from May 2011 to February 2022, our results show time-varying responses to structural oil shocks in the short- and medium-run periods, with more fluctuations in responses detected over the full sample period in the former. Overall, we detect a break in the contagious impacts of oil shocks during and in the aftermath of, the 2014–2015 oil crisis and COVID-19 crisis. Specifically, the Bahraini market is found to exhibit a positive (negative) reaction to the oil supply shocks (OS) and oil market-specific demand shocks (OSD) throughout the pandemic period. Furthermore, we uncover a transient response from the Saudi and Qatari CDS spreads to the aggregate demand shocks (ADS) and the OSD over the full sample period, indicating the need for portfolio rebalancing. In the UAE, we detect a positive impact over the three sampled years of OSD since 2011. Moreover, a notable decoupling pattern continues to appear between short- and medium-term innovations in the ADS. Our results suggest adopting more conservative trading in the CDS markets while understanding the oil price and the economic state. The complexity of the trading strategy should also depend on the target Gulf market itself and that seems essential when it comes to investing in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",credit default swap; GCC country; oil shock; sovereign credit risk; spread; time-varying impact,

Although several studies have focussed on issues related to the energy consumption of the basic cryptocurrencies, an open question remains regarding the environmental depiction of Bitcoin. By resorting to Bayesian analysis and quantile cointegrated vector autoregression (CQVAR), this study seeks to disentangle the driving forces that shape the carbon footprint of Bitcoin. The sample used in the empirical analysis consists of a daily panel dataset covering 50 countries over the period 2016–2018. The empirical findings corroborate a causal effect between the use of Bitcoin and its underlying carbon dioxide emissions generated by the increasing energy load. The CQVAR is associated with positive marginal posterior means for most of the covariates of the model across all the estimated quantiles. In contrast, there is a negative and statistically significant relationship between Bitcoin miner's revenue and carbon emissions, uncovering a multimodal distribution pattern of the marginal posterior densities which is stronger at higher than in lower quantiles. This finding suggests that the lower (higher) miner's Bitcoin revenues, the more abrupt (gradual) the effect on environmental degradation. Therefore, a sustainable energy strategy focussing on the penetration of renewable energy sources along with the use of energy-efficient mining hardware will alleviate the carbon footprint of Bitcoin. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Bayesian analysis; Bitcoin; blockchain; carbon emissions; energy load,alternative energy; Bayesian analysis; carbon emission; climate change; currency; energy use; environmental degradation

Then, out-strength and in-strength are adopted to analyze the SIFI. Finally, we use panel data regression model to investigate the determinant of the SIFIs. The empirical results show that: (a) The network density reaches a peak when the financial system under pressure during the China's stock market disaster of 2015. (b) Large banks and insurances usually display systemic importance, while some small financial institutions are also SIFIs due to their high value of out-strength and in-strength.

We find that after controlling for endogeneity, firms managed by female CEOs issue less debt than those managed by male CEOs. Female CEOs being more risk averse than male CEOs is the underlying mechanism which drives the negative relation between female CEOs and firm leverage. Further, we find that the effect of CEO gender is more pronounced when the firm's CEO is younger, the litigation risk is higher, and the market is more competitive. In terms of debt structure, firms managed by female CEOs prefer to maintain positive debt capacity and have longer debt maturities. Finally, we show that CEO gender has a stronger impact on debt structure than CFO gender. Taken together, our evidence suggests that there exist gender differences in terms of corporate debt borrowing decision making. © 2023 The Authors.

The model reveals the following interesting findings. First, under complete information—where the Venture Capitalist has a bargaining power - Venture Capitalist offers the entrepreneur a profit sharing ratio that is less than her capital contribution ratio. Second, in an incomplete information setting, the entrepreneur demands a profit sharing ratio higher than her capital contribution ratio when the sum of the marginal cost (from exercising a higher effort) and private benefits (from exercising a low effort) is greater than the marginal return (from exercising a high effort). In addition, the model is used to derive a span of negotiation about the profit sharing ratio.

The influence of non-financial enterprises' financialization on total factor productivity of enterprises: Promotion or inhibition?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177465261&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2912&partnerID=40&md5=6fa85d9d35b60293725aedb02bc995a5,"In recent years, the increasing trend of financialization of non-financial enterprises and the improvement of total factor productivity (TFP) have attracted extensive attention. The research sample for this study covers non-financial firms listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2008 to 2020. Then an econometric regression model is built to examine the impact of financialization of non-financial enterprises on enterprises' TFP. The mediation effect model is used to investigate the mechanisms of non-financial enterprises' financialization (NFEF) on TFP. The heterogeneity in investment efficiency, property rights and political affiliation is further discussed. The findings show that the NFEF has a considerable negative influence on enterprises' TFP, which still stands after endogenous treatment and a series of robustness tests. Moreover, NFEF significantly inhibits TFP by crowding out R&D investment and significantly promotes TFP by alleviating financing restrictions. Both the ‘crowding-out effect’ and ‘reservoir effect’ of financialization of non-financial enterprises are verified, and the former is greater. The influence of NFEF on TFP has the heterogeneity in investment efficiency and political affiliation, but the heterogeneity in property rights is insignificant. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",influence effect; mechanism; mediation effect model; non-financial enterprises' financialization; total factor productivity,
Is illiquidity priced in an international factor pricing model?

Since illiquidity measures are endogenous, we propose an algorithm that generates robust instruments which are combined with a GMM estimator to cope with both the endogeneity issues surrounding illiquidity and other eventual specification errors. In this dynamic framework, we generally find that the most significant factors correspond to market and size but illiquidity may matter depending on the level of the beta. We find that illiquidity has more impact on returns in expansion than in recession. However, the bid-ask spread seems to behave differently from the other illiquidity measures. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",dynamic panel model; illiquidity; international Fama–French factors; robust IV-GMM; specification/endogeneity issues,

This article analyses that issue by assessing the impact of financial crises on governmental social spending and its components (healthcare, education and social protection) using a panel of 108 countries from 1991 to 2019. An important contribution of this study is that it assesses the effects of different types of financial crises (banking, currency and debt) in addition to distinguishing between developed and developing countries. The findings indicate that while developed countries neutralise the adverse effects of crises by increasing social spending, developing countries tend to shrink outlays—in particular healthcare and social protection—when financial crises strike, despite the associated negative consequences on human and social well-being. Moreover, debt crises proved to be more detrimental to social spending than banking and currency crises in developing countries. An important policy implication arising from our analysis is that governments should maintain a high level of fiscal balance in normal times to be able to finance welfare state expansion programmes during periods of financial crises, especially in emerging/developing countries. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",banking crisis; currency crisis; debt crisis; developed versus developing countries; financial crises; social spending,

We segregate 23 manufacturing industries into high, medium, and low productive groups based on their productivity performance, which is estimated by Levinsohn-Petrin (2003) productivity procedure. We find that the long-run and short-run relationship among these three variables varies across three groups. Further, there is a long-run and strong causality exists among the three core variables in all three categories irrespective of their variance in productivity performances. Thus, there is a need for a comprehensive and unified industrial policy in line with trade and FDI as the choice variables are well-connected in the long-run. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",ARDL-PMG model; export; Indian manufacturing industries; outward FDI; productivity,India; export; foreign direct investment; Granger causality test; industrial policy; manufacturing; productivity
How important is tourism for growth?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174300744&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2897&partnerID=40&md5=c99b18caaa8afc58ce7401e97df53d80,"We revisit the tourism-led growth hypothesis by utilising a panel set of 108 countries over the period 1996–2017. We quantify the effects of tourism on the entire conditional distribution of economic growth for both relatively poor and relatively rich countries within a panel quantile regression framework. We address the unobserved heterogeneity and potential endogeneity concerns. We reveal that the lower the conditional growth rate a country experiences the more important is tourism development for the conditional growth distribution for both developing and developed countries. The size of the effect in developed countries is twice as high as in developing ones. On the other hand, tourism specialisation is beneficial only at higher quantiles of the conditional growth distribution and only for developed countries. On the contrary, it brings about an undesirable effect in developing countries. Finally, we examine the impact of a reduction in tourism activity on economic growth due to an exogenous shock (i.e., COVID-19). Simulation analysis based on the quantile regression estimates shows that countries facing relatively low growth rates conditionally to the growth distribution are affected the most. Policymakers may consider the importance of tourism activity in the growth process and formulate strategies that align with the growth experience of each country. © 2023 The Authors.

Firstly, the relationships between the shares of explorative and collaborative innovations and the performance are at most U shaped and only observed in firms pursuing some specific patenting strategies. Furthermore, the thresholds that permit these firms to benefit from the improvement of financial performance through increasing the shares of explorative and collaborative innovations are at least as high as 63%. Secondly, the patenting strategies in the extremes of the exploitative-explorative and solitary-collaborative dichotomies, such as the solitarily exploitative patenting and the collaboratively explorative patenting, have a greater value-enhancing potential than those falling between the extremes of the dichotomies, failing to support the proposition that firms adopting an innovation strategy balancing between exploitation and exploration have better financial performance in the long run. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",average treatment effect; collaborative innovation; explorative innovation; financial performance; patenting activity; real options,China; financial system; industrial enterprise; innovation
Does brand capital improve stock liquidity?

We posit that brand capital improves the corporate information environment, enhances competitiveness, and increases firm visibility ultimately resulting in higher stock liquidity. Using a sample of Chinese listed firms, we find a positive relationship between brand capital and stock liquidity. Further analyses show that the effect of brand capital is more pronounced for firms with low media coverage and analyst following. Moreover, the effect of brand capital on stock liquidity is significant for non-state-owned enterprises. Our mechanism analyses also confirm that brand capital plays an informational role by effectively mitigating information asymmetry and adverse selection, leading to higher stock liquidity. Our study provides the first evidence of the nexus between brand capital and stock liquidity and extends the literature on the capital market implications of brand capital. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",adverse selection; brand capital; China; information asymmetry; NSOEs; stock liquidity,

First, we test whether the response of stock returns to interest rate differential contrasts between high and low interest rate environments. Second, we further test whether positive and negative interest rate differentials impact differently on stock returns. For completeness, we examine the role of negative interest rate policy in the nexus by testing whether the response of stock returns to interest rate differential varies between negative and positive low interest rate environments. The third objective becomes necessary as negative interest rate may not necessarily translate into negative interest rate differential and vice versa. Using panel data methods that allow for nonstationarity, mixed order of integration and cross-sectional heterogeneity in the estimation process, we find contrasting evidence between the two interest rate environments. While the relationship is negative for the low interest rate economies, a positive sign is observed for the high interest rate group. The ‘asymmetry’ effect in the relationship is only evident in the short run and in addition interest rate differential tends to improve stock returns in negative interest rate environment albeit in the short run. We also find contrasting evidence between the positive and negative low interest rates where the nexus remains negative for the positive (low) interest rate group and positive nexus for negative (low) interest rate category. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",interest rate differential; negative interest rate; panel ARDL; stock returns,economic development; financial policy; interest rate; literature review; panel data; stock market
Foreign exchange hedging using regime-switching models: The case of pound sterling,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174843086&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2893&partnerID=40&md5=892f7fd436ac0d2eadec0eb0258c852b,"We develop a four-state regime-switching model for optimal foreign exchange (FX) hedging using forward contracts. The states correspond to four distinct market conditions, each defined by the direction and magnitude of deviation of the prevailing FX spot rate from its long-term trends. The model's performance is evaluated for five currencies against the pound sterling for various horizons. Our examination compares the hedging outcomes of the proposed model to those of other commonly employed hedging methods. The empirical results suggest that our model demonstrates the highest level of risk reduction for the US dollar, euro, Japanese yen and Turkish lira and the second-best performance for the Indian rupee. The risk reduction is significantly higher for lira compared with the other approaches, implying that the proposed model might be able to provide much more effective hedging for highly volatile currencies. The improved performance of the model can be attributed to the adjustability of the estimation horizon for the optimal hedge ratio based on the prevailing market conditions. This, in turn, allows it to better capture fat-tail properties that are frequently observed in FX returns. Our findings suggest that FX investors tend to use short-term memory during low market conditions (relative to trend) and long-term memory in high ones. The results would be also useful to build a better understanding of how investor behaviour depends on market conditions and mitigate the adverse behavioural implications of short-term memory, such as panic. © 2023 Bank of England and The Authors.

This is because the corporate board of a conglomerate-affiliated firm (CAF) has high moral hazard exposure due to its accountability to the superior parent board at the apex of the conglomerate structure. Based on a sample of 304 listed firms from 18 countries, we find a CAF board is less independent than a standalone board with no superior reporting body. A firm's affiliation with the conglomerate per se affects its board independence, regardless of the parent shareholding level. The additional analysis finds that the lack of board independence significantly impacts a CAF's financial performance, although the market impact is insignificant. © 2023 The Authors.

Using an endogenous switching regression model, this study finds that adopters of agricultural technologies have higher food consumption expenditure per adult. Moreover, the significant difference in food consumption expenditure per adult equivalent between the actual and counterfactual scenario is very high. The result of the study confirmed that adoption of agricultural technology has a direct and significant impact on increasing household's consumption expenditure while also reducing household poverty.

Do institutional quality and its threshold matter in the sensitivity of the renewable energy transition to financial development? New empirical perspectives,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176128943&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2900&partnerID=40&md5=244f3a301c3702dea616f5f9f3c09f67,"The transition to renewable energy is critical for environmental sustainability, consistent with sustainable development goals (SDGs) 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13 of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Scholars have identified financial development and institutional quality as significant factors determining the renewable energy transition in developing countries. This study opines that the efficiency of the financial system in supporting and providing the substantial financial implications that a switch to renewable energy necessitates depends on the quality of the institutional framework. Weak institutions in developing countries produce loopholes and inherent flaws in the financial system that facilitate corruption and opportunism, ultimately promoting dirty energy usage and technology at the expense of renewable energy. This process suggests that the interaction between financial development and institutions can either accelerate or impede the transition to renewable energy, depending on an economy's institutional architecture. Considering Africa's enormous renewable energy resources, previous research has overlooked the implications of the interplay between institutional quality and financial development in spurring Africa's transition to renewable energy. Thus, this study looks at the role of institutions in moderating the relationship between financial development and renewable energy in Africa from 1990 to 2019, using first- and second-generation estimators to capture econometrics' pitfalls such as endogeneity, cross-sectional dependence, and heterogeneity inherent in the panel dataset. This study departs from previous research in that it uses a dynamic panel threshold to determine the threshold of institutions beyond which financial development is stimulated to spur Africa's transition to renewable energy. The findings show that institutions create loopholes that allow rent-seeking, opportunism, and sharp practices in the African financial system. These inherent flaws divert financial resources to support dirty energy and undermine the financial sector's ability to support a renewable energy transition on the continent. Also, the findings from the threshold of institutions affirm that African countries operate predominantly below the threshold of institutions, over which institutions enable financial development to expedite the continent's transition to renewable energy. The study suggests that institutional quality is essential in the relationship between financial development and Africa's shift to renewable energy. The findings' policy implications are discussed and outlined. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Africa; financial development; institutional quality; renewable energy,
The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on hospitality stock returns in China,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100096173&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2508&partnerID=40&md5=05654e8a2ba967793396bf278b7cf7b5,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has already devastated the world, and the economy becomes the most critical challenge for any country worldwide. The increasing uncertainty of the COVID-19 outbreak has made stock markets in China more turbulent and less predictable. Under the current exceptional circumstances, the hospitality industry suffered the most due to the travel restrictions. This research thus assesses the dynamic relationship among the COVID-19 outbreak, macroeconomic fluctuations and hospitality stock returns based on a structural VAR framework from 13 January to 11 May 2020, in China. Evidence reveals that macroeconomic fluctuations and hospitality stock returns are significantly affected by shocks from the COVID-19 outbreak. An unanticipated positive change of the COVID-19 explosion triggers an addition in exchange rates and causes a reduction in the stock market and hospitality industry returns. For the impacts of the exchange rate, findings reveal that a surprise increase in exchange rates (currency depreciation) exerts a significant negative influence on stock market returns. Additionally, a positive change of stock market returns is linked to a decline in exchange rates and a rise in hospitality industry returns. Therefore, knowledge of these relationships can enable policymakers to evaluate and implement effective policies to stabilize the stock markets and help investors to make appropriate investment strategies. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",China; COVID-19; stock returns; structural VAR,China; COVID-19; economic impact; exchange rate; hospitality industry; macroeconomics; pandemic; stock market
"Does democracy matter in banking performance? Exploring the linkage between democracy, economic freedom and banking performance in the European Union member states",2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176400399&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2911&partnerID=40&md5=b6581110b1290c053e45d768a279a21c,"Literature on the effects of socio-political factors and the quality of political-economic institutions on banking performance is scarce and mixed. To contribute to this literature, this study analyzes whether democracy and economic freedom affect the banking sector in European Union member countries. We provide empirical evidence of the influence of democracy and economic freedom on banking performance using a sample of 27 countries from 2001 to 2020, and accounting-based return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) as performance measures. A dynamic model (system GMM) was used to address issues such as heteroscedasticity, serial correlation, and endogeneity. These findings indicate that democracy is positively associated with banking performance, whereas economic freedom negatively affects it in the sample countries. Additionally, this study adds to the growing literature on the relationship between control variables (macroeconomic determinants, bank-specific factors, or a country's legislative regime) and banking performance.

Asymmetric persistence in Turkish interest and inflation rates: New evidence from quantile unit root test with structural shifts,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164485474&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2855&partnerID=40&md5=6ff43e3c8a436cb2d0f743d42ae312bf,"This study investigates the persistence in Turkish interest and inflation rates since the implementation of inflation-targeting monetary policy, covering the period from January 2006 to July 2022. We focus on accounting for asymmetric persistence by benefiting from recent developments in quantile unit root analysis. The findings indicate that while the conventional unit root tests support the persistence of shocks to interest rates and inflation, the quantile unit root test demonstrates an asymmetric behaviour of the persistence, implying a time-varying structure with mean reversion (persistency) of the shocks in low (high) inflation periods. Furthermore, the half-lives increase with the positive shocks, indicating a longer speed of adjustment in the high inflation regime. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between interest rates and inflation and have sound policy implications. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",asymmetry; non-normal errors; quantile unit root; structural breaks; Turkey,

We conjectured that weak FTR languages lead speakers to hold less precise beliefs about timing and, hence, are associated with higher stock price crash risk. Accordingly, using a comprehensive sample of firms in 36 countries (regions) with 221,414 observations from 1988 to 2017, we found that stock price crash risk was significantly higher in regions dominated by speakers of weak FTR languages. Furthermore, the effect of FTR on stock price crash risk was weakened in countries with stronger formal and informal institutions (e.g., high disclosure quality, greater transparency, and less corruption). Our results gave a new explanation for the heterogeneity in stock price crash risk, provided insights into whether language is an economic institution, and added to the research on the effects of languages on economic and financial outcomes. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",crash risk; formal institution; future-time reference; informal institution; language; stock price,

We show that in the core/periphery fiscal regime, described by an asymmetry in the sequence of moves between the core and the peripheral member-states, asymmetric shocks pass through at the union level to the inflation rate and the output gap when there are strategically significant spill-over effects and the monetary policy's and fiscal policies' instruments are not perfect substitutes in the stabilisation process. The monetary authority reacts to asymmetric shocks, but does not succeed in fully offsetting them. The first best implies the coordination of fiscal policies. A second best embraces the fiscal leadership strategic regime (as a form of implicit coordination), when there are strong interconnections in the union, or the use of policy instruments by the fiscal authorities that directly decrease inflation when fiscal policy is expansionary, such as taxes, production subsidies or public investment, when there is a strong cost channel of monetary policy. © 2023 The Author.

To this aim, this study applies novel quantile-based approaches, namely Quantile autoregression unit root test, Quantile-on-quantile approach, and Quantile Granger-causality test covering the period from 01 January 2020 to 15 September 2020. Main findings of the study are (1) G7 stock return series are stationary for all quantiles of the conditional distributions with minor exceptions meaning that shocks have temporary effects on stock returns of G7 markets. (2) The impact of Twitter-based uncertainty strongly depends on the market condition, whether it is bullish or bearish for all G7 markets. A heterogeneous association exists between variables caused by different market conditions. (3) A bi-directional causal association exists between stock returns-TEU and stock returns-TMU. This result confirms the existence of feedback hypothesis between G7 stock returns and TEU, TMU, respectively.

This paper further investigates whether COVID-19 has any significant effect on the relationship between US consumer confidence indices and their determinants. The empirical investigation is conducted by means of non-linear asymmetric autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) tests, so that the asymmetric effect of uncertainty and other determinants on consumer confidence may be studied. The paper applies monthly data from January 2010 to December 2021. Results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic did not alter the stability of the long-term relationship between the consumer confidence indices and their determinants. Uncertainty imposed by government policies plays a significant role before and, more prominently, during the pandemic. The increased effect of the uncertainty may be due to the jump in economic uncertainty during the COVID era. Our work may help to foster consumer confidence in terms of macroeconomic policy variables. The results can also expand the scope of investors' decision making as it provides an in-depth understanding of the drivers of consumers' confidence in the US economy. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",asymmetric; confidence; COVID; NARDL; non-linear,
Market forces in healthcare insurance: The impact of healthcare reform on regulated competition revisited,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168607434&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2875&partnerID=40&md5=166757ee041ab9ebd4a65ea1cf4252e3,"The Dutch healthcare insurance reform in 2006 replaced the dual system of public and private insurance with a single compulsory health insurance scheme, in which insurance providers compete for customers in a free market. This paper investigates whether competition among healthcare insurers has indeed increased and their efficiency has improved. We measure competition directly from either shifts in market shares, or developments in profits, using Dutch regulatory data. We find that a structural break occurs after the reform: competition is significantly higher after 2006 than before. This holds both for the analysis based on shifts in market shares and that based on profits. Several robustness tests confirm this outcome. Hence, the reform has had a significant impact. Nevertheless, we find that the health insurance sector is still less competitive than financial sectors such as banking and life insurance. © 2023 The Authors.

Specifically, we also show that this negative effect is more profound for state-owned enterprises, carbon-intensive enterprises, and enterprises with lower risk taking. The results also give evidence that the effect of climate policy uncertainty on firm investment can last up to three quarters and disappear within 1 year. Finally, we propose that investment irreversibility is plausible channel through which climate policy uncertainty discourages investment. Overall, these results shed light on the real effects of climate policy uncertainty and the determinants of investment. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",climate policy uncertainty; firm investment; investment irreversibility,

These results suggest that creditors may view D&O insurance as an external monitoring tool that helps improve corporate governance. However, D&O insurance induces higher firm risk, but cannot help decrease agency costs or improve firm performance, that is, it results in more severe managerial opportunism. Our findings suggest that D&O insurance, to some extent, misguides creditors' lending decisions. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",agency cost; corporate governance; creditors' lending decisions; D&O insurance; debt maturity structure; managerial opportunism,

Using interest rates to predict economic growth: Are corporate bonds better?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165601727&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2867&partnerID=40&md5=5797f68a70f9a1cc8533e2c42c940eec,"We consider whether government bonds, through the term structure, or corporate bonds, through the default yield, provide predictive power for output, consumption and investment growth in the United States. Such predictive power will allow policy-makers to use the information as a leading indicator for macroeconomic performance and will improve our understanding of the links between real and financial markets. Full sample results suggest that both interest rate series exhibit predictive power for each of the macroeconomic growth series. Time-variation in the predictive coefficient reveals the waning influence of the term structure and the rising influence of the default yield. Forecast results, which are obtained from a rolling window approach, likewise suggest both series have information content for macroeconomic conditions, but there is a change in their relative strengths. These results may arise as interest rates have declined since the highs of the early to mid-1980s thus reducing the information content of government yields, whereas corporate bonds respond more to investor views of macroeconomic risk, which affects a firm's ability to repay its debt. Furthermore, short-term rates are largely held unprecedently low since the dotcom crash. © 2023 The Authors.

The findings remain unchanged when different proxies of financial dependency, banking sector competitiveness, and risk are employed. Further analysis of the ‘transmission mechanism’—the channel by which the extent of banking sector competitiveness influences corporate risk—uncovers that the competitive banking sectors increase firms' access to finance and allow them to operate with lesser financing obstacles. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bank competition; BRIC; corporate risk; earnings volatility; financial dependence,

The impacts of CEO power on green innovation are different under the positive and negative aspects of performance feedback, and under financial and environmental performance feedback. Accordingly, heterogeneous institutional investors respond differently to these various situations. Specifically, pressure-resistant institutional investors serve as ‘supervisors’ under the positive aspects of financial and environmental performance feedback and shift to ‘bystanders’ under the negative aspects of financial and environmental performance feedback. Pressure-sensitive institutional investors always act as ‘bystanders’ under different performance feedback. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",CEO power; environmental performance; financial performance; green innovation; institutional investors; performance feedback,

To fulfil this objective, we use the adjusted thermal optimal path model. The results suggest that conventional banks adopt the same risk-taking behaviour for performance measures, regardless of their size. However, the size mainly influences the attitudes of managers towards Islamic banks. On the other hand, small Islamic banks, whether under- or over-performing, take excessive risks. This behaviour is mainly explained by loss aversion. However, large Islamic banks that situated above the target are risk-averse, since they adopt defensive behaviour. The results reveal that for risk measures and for both small and large banks, a bank's business model does not affect managers' attitude to risk. Therefore, small (large) banks adopt excessive risk-taking (risk-averse) behaviour and an offensive (defensive) strategy. The study has important implications for GCC banking regulators, supervisors, and market participants. Thus, our findings imply that understanding the impact of the bank size and business model on the risk-taking behaviour of Islamic and conventional banks can help them reduce their risk and mitigate moral hazard and regulatory arbitrage behaviour. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",adjusted thermal optimal path model; conventional banks; Islamic bank; risk-taking behaviour; size,

Employing zero-inflated ordered probit models and a unique longitudinal survey of approximately 66,000 individuals in Great Britain, we find that consumers are more likely to enter into bankruptcy proceedings when the bankruptcy benefit increases and when they become unemployed. We find that the effects of adverse events differ across bankruptcy types. Individuals who experience the onset of health problems are more likely to choose reorganization of debts (i.e., income gleaning), whereas individuals who get divorced or separated are more likely to prefer the discharge of debts (i.e., fresh start). We also examine access to credit after bankruptcy. We find that individuals are excluded from the credit markets post-bankruptcy and the impact differs across bankruptcy types. Credit exclusion for fresh starters is dramatic, swift but short-lived, while for income gleaners, it is gradual, slow but lasts longer. © 2023 The Authors.

"Implications of bank competition, financial stability, and gender gap on access to finance: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa",2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169803667&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2869&partnerID=40&md5=15ffbe496d123f8412aad7a46f76b5bb,"Whether bank competition promotes access to finance is highly debated in economic literature and policy circles. Amidst this debate, this paper investigates the implications of bank competition, financial stability, and gender gap on access to finance for 40 Sub-Saharan African countries using 12,504 firm-level observations from the World Bank Enterprise Survey. In addition to structural measures, competition has been measured by three non-structural measures (Lerner index, Boone indicator, and Panzar-Rosse H-statistic). Results obtained through the probit model and probit model with sample selection (PSS) suggest that a higher degree of bank competition positively affects firm's credit availability in the Sub-Saharan African region. Results also indicate that firms owned by female entrepreneurs are more likely to report greater difficulties in obtaining formal finance. The findings suggest that policymakers and other stakeholders should direct policy actions that promote competition in the credit market by reducing the cost of credit. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",access to finance; bank competition; financial stability; Sub-Saharan Africa,
"Joint elicitation of elasticity of intertemporal substitution, risk and time preferences",2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169830491&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2879&partnerID=40&md5=0bde0c991ea23f2bfa6427b7937b65b6,"The elicitation of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS), discount factor and risk attitude parameters in dynamic models is of central importance to economics, finance and public policy. This paper suggests an alternative method to jointly elicit and estimate these three parameters using experimental data. We employ a new model based on dynamic quantile preferences, where individuals maximize the stream of future (Formula presented.) -quantile utilities, for (Formula presented.). These preferences are simple, dynamically consistent and monotonic. In the quantile model, the risk attitude is captured by the quantile (Formula presented.) of the payoff distribution, while the EIS and the discount factor are related to the utility function describing individual's intertemporal behaviour, hence allowing for complete separability between risk, EIS and discount factor. The estimation of the parameters of interest uses a structural maximum likelihood method. Individual's risk aversion is estimated below the median. The discount factor is marginally smaller than estimates reported in the literature, and the EIS is slightly larger than one, which suggests that utility over time is concave. The estimates for the elasticity contrast with those reported by the existing studies using observational disaggregated data, which in general find an elasticity smaller than one. © 2023 The Authors.

We find that board size and risk governance significantly affect banks' financial flexibility for Islamic and conventional banks. However, Shari'ah governance rules determine how that relationship is manifested in Islamic banks. We show that SSB size and busy SSBs enhance Islamic banks' financial flexibility. Our results show that Western corporate governance structures may lead to suboptimal financial flexibility.

Accounting-based variables as an early warning indicator of financial distress in crisis and non-crisis periods,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165627303&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2864&partnerID=40&md5=05eafb364dc2050f0aeb9bf9f14873a8,"Financial integration in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region is a key focus of the ASEAN Economic Community. Whereas many studies focus on modelling corporate default, this paper identifies early warning indicators of financial distress before a default, using multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) models with a sample of listed and delisted companies in the ASEAN region. The analysis examines 720 companies in 10 different industries across six ASEAN countries from 1997 to 2016. The study constructs individual models for each country as well as an overall model for the entire region, using both in-sample and out-of-sample approaches. This overall model could be useful for an integrated banking system. To ensure robustness, the study also separately examines the predictive performance of the MDA models across different economic crises: the Asian financial crisis (AFC) from 1997 to 2000, the global financial crisis (GFC) from 2007 to 2009 and their pre- and post-crisis periods. We find that profitability ratios are the best indicators of financial distress in the ASEAN region, followed by liquidity and leverage ratios. In addition, our findings reveal common indicators that can be used to predict financial distress across ASEAN countries. The single model performs reasonably well in predicting financial distress 1 year ahead. In addition, the model is extended to incorporate a market-based indicator into the MDA models, the distance to default. However, the inclusion of this indicator does not significantly improve the accuracy of the models in predicting financial distress at listed firms in the ASEAN region. © 2023 The Authors.

The optimal time to buy and hold stock in a reversal,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166638495&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2868&partnerID=40&md5=932cb0ebee1cdd504c10d6f0f938e6a0,"Investors cannot anticipate a return reversal in the stock market. Therefore, choosing the optimal time to buy and hold a stock is vital. This paper formulates a disorder problem using the optimal stopping theory to study the optimal time to buy and hold a stock when a downward trend is about to reverse. The results show that investors should buy a stock when the conditional probability of a return reversal hits an optimal boundary for the first time. The optimal boundary is uniquely determined by the stock return, volatility, and the intensity of return reversal. Moreover, the optimal boundary decreases as the stock volatility and the intensity of return reversal increase. We use the China Securities Index 300 (CSI 300), Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500), Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), and Russell 2000 indexes to estimate the parameters and the related optimal boundary. We find that the estimated optimal boundary can be used to time stock buying. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",buy and hold; return reversal; stock market; the disorder problem; the optimal stopping theory; timing strategy,
Corporate risk disclosure and cost of capital: Does measurement matter?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165292150&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2862&partnerID=40&md5=c0e4cffd33aa0df9d44c05f225cf50dc,"This study argues that different definitions/perceptions of risk information could affect investors' decisions differently. Using a sample of 328 non-financial UK firms and departing from existing literature, this study measures corporate risk disclosure (RD) via computerized content analysis to capture four different perspectives of defining RD. This study investigates (i) the effects of these RD measures on the Cost of Capital (COC), (ii) the influence of analysts' coverage on the relationship between RD and COC, and (iii) whether the RD nature (favourable/unfavourable) might affect COC differently. Lenders and equity holders are found not to consider any risk information expressed as a variation around a target, while only lenders consider risk information that reveals negative outcomes. However, lenders and equity holders consider risk information that expresses negative and positive outcomes together. Besides, firms that disclose extra risk information and have a large analyst following suffer from a higher Cost of Equity (COE) compared with those with fewer analysts following. Additionally, lenders impose a lower interest rate on firms with a higher unfavourable RD, while equity holders ask for lower returns from the firms with a higher favourable RD. The study has significant implications for capital market participants, researchers, and policymakers. © 2023 The Authors.

Several immediate causes for the bad loan crisis have been pointed out. However, poor market discipline, the ultimate root cause of the bad loan crisis, has not been paid adequate attention. This study seeks to investigate how effectively the market disciplinary forces, captured through information disclosure, interbank deposits, concentration and ownership structure, incentivise the Indian banks to adopt prudential risk management by enhancing their risk-weighted capital ratio. The findings of the study show that information disclosure and interbank deposits do not induce prudential risk behaviour among banks in India. However, with increasing concentration in the banking sector, a higher level of information disclosure effectively induces banks to maintain higher capital ratios, but inter-bank deposits do not have any significant effect on bank capital. We also observe that government banks maintain lower capital ratios as compared to private banks indicating government banks' higher expectation of government bailout. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",capital ratio; India; interbank deposits; market discipline; non-performing assets; prudential risk behaviour,
Does policy uncertainty affect non-financial disclosure?

Our findings are robust to alternative measures of policy uncertainty and when controlling for endogeneity. In a set of additional analyses, we show that the industries within which firms operate and their environmental performance are channels that explain the release of climate-related information.

At best, conventional sector rotation generates modest outperformance, which quickly diminishes after allowing for transaction costs and incorrectly timing the business cycle. The results are robust to alternative sector and business cycle definitions. We find that relaxing sector rotation assumptions and letting any industry excess return predict future returns of other industries results in predictability not significantly different than what would be expected by random chance. © 2023 The Authors.

We use both panel data and cross-sectional regressions as well as the difference-in-differences approach to derive the empirical results. We generally find some evidence that highly rated ESG firms performed slightly worse than lower rated ESG both overall and during the pandemic. However, once we control for governance at the country level, we find that in high governance scoring countries ESGHigh companies perform better than ESGLow companies. Finally, when we examine the relative performance of EU companies compared to companies in economies less impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, namely South Korea and Australia, we find that during the pandemic, the South Korean and Australian companies performed much better than their counterparts in Europe. © 2023 The Authors.

Using a two-stage methodology based on the structural VAR (SVAR) and entropy-based analysis over the period January 2000–October 2022, the results show that the links between financial stress and oil shocks are contingent on the type of shock. Within this, oil supply shock is mildly connected to financial stress; oil demand shock is vulnerable to innovation from financial stress; and oil-specific demand shock has a noticeable time-variable element wherein the shock prevails at the beginning of the sample and financial stress dominates the transmission at the end of the sample. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",causality; entropy-based analysis; financial stress; oil structural shocks; SVAR,

Given that a substantial amount of credit risk is generated in retail banking, this study exploits a large number of micro-loan portfolio level data of a systemic Greek bank and examines, for the first time, the IS behaviour at the retail banking level, contrasting the expansion period (2006–2008) with the financial crisis period (2009–2011). This specific case study provides more granular data compared with traditional archival studies, thus allowing the immediate and more frequent identification of exogenous (such as crisis effects) and endogenous (such as the geographic origination of loan portfolios) features that may affect IS practices. Based on the association between pre-provision loan income and loans loss provisions as a proxy for IS, we employ the robust Mean Group estimator (Pesaran and Smith, Journal of Econometrics, 1995;68(1):79–113) and find that this association is higher in expansionary periods and declines in recession. Moreover, we conclude that the IS behaviour is affected by geographical features of loan portfolios. © 2023 The Authors.

To unriddle this issue, we touch upon a novel perspective by exploring how monetary policy moderates the influence of economic complexity and technological innovation on energy productivity and carbon productivity in the presence of the labour force participation ratio, trade openness, financial inclusion, and GDP. Our study builds upon the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) structure, considering the Group of Seven (G7) countries as the analytical laboratory over the 1995–2019 period. The principal outcomes based on the novel Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) are as follows: A higher level of economic complexity is associated with enhanced environmental sustainability. In addition, technological innovation is beneficial to environmental sustainability, especially across countries reporting moderate levels of environmental sustainability. Considering the direct impact, contractionary monetary policy deteriorates environmental sustainability, while expansionary monetary policy promotes it for green central banking in place. Regarding the moderating impacts, expansionary monetary policy is unveiled to manifest beneficial environmental impacts of economic complexity and technological innovation, provided that inflationary pressures remain under control. Based on our findings, it is recommended to formulate a monetary policy inclusive of climate-related risks to capitalize on the environmentally favourable impacts of economic complexity and technological innovation. Finally, the monetary expansions keeping the inflationary pressures under control would benefit environmental sustainability. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",economic complexity; energy productivity; environmental sustainability; G7 countries; green central banking; monetary policy; technological innovation,

The effect of CEO-to-worker pay disparities on CEO compensation: The mediating role of shareholder say on pay votes,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165272548&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2866&partnerID=40&md5=cdd879c50a1fe0547fd769b53650b19f,"In response to large pay disparities caused by rising CEO compensation and stagnant employee pay, US financial regulators have taken several initiatives to mobilise shareholders. However, the ability of these initiatives to enhance shareholder engagement and reduce excessive CEO compensation has been questioned. Using a large sample of 1594 non-financial firms from the Russell 3000 index over 2013–2019, we disentangle the complex role that shareholder engagement towards CEO-to-worker pay disparities plays on CEO compensation. We find that higher CEO-to-worker pay disparities increase shareholder dissent say on pay votes and that, paradoxically, shareholder dissent say on pay votes increase CEO compensation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that shareholder engagement mediates the relationship between CEO-to-worker pay disparities and CEO compensation through their say on pay votes. Our findings are consistent with the relative deprivation theory as shareholders react to large pay disparities to avoid the negative consequences of a feeling of deprivation on employees. They are also in line with the agency theory, as shareholder reactions to large CEO-to-worker pay disparities trigger reactions from the remuneration committee to better align CEO pay with their interests. Overall, our findings support the existence of a shareholder engagement channel driven by social comparison mechanisms and agency responses. This study has important implications for regulators by unpacking the usefulness of these regulatory initiatives to shareholders and also documenting their unintended consequences on CEO compensation. © 2023 The Authors.

The impact of IFRS complexity on analyst forecast properties: The moderating role of high quality audit,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100175714&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2456&partnerID=40&md5=6e6a7327e3c7e774ab9593a20cb6690e,"This paper examines the impact of International Financial Reporting Standards (hereafter IFRS) complexity on analyst forecast properties including forecast errors, forecast dispersion and forecast revision. Because high-quality audit is likely to moderate the effect of complexity on analyst forecast properties, Industry Specialization (ISP) as a proxy for high quality audit is introduced as a moderating variable in this paper. The complexity of individual IFRS standards is measured based on IFRS reconciliation statements capturing the adjustments on accounts affected by the changes in accounting standards. We analyze 322 companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Our results suggest that all IFRS standards are not equally complex. A few standards are relatively more complex. These standards have a positive effect on analyst forecast errors, forecast dispersion and forecast revision. In addition, we find that high quality audit (proxied by city-level industry specialist auditors) can mitigate the adverse impact of IFRS complexity on analyst forecast errors but not on forecast dispersion and revision. More interestingly, the mitigating effect of high quality audit is restricted to only a group of companies exposed to a higher level of aggregate IFRS complexity. The findings of our study contribute to the IFRS literature by identifying the most complex accounting standards. Secondly, this study provides an ex-ante experiment in IFRS adoption, which can be used by adopting countries to understand the impact of IFRS on the analyst forecasts. Finally, our study helps regulators to understand the effects of the complexity of accounting standards on users of financial statements. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",accounting complexity; auditor industry specialization; financial analyst forecast; IFRS,accountability; capital flow; capital market; complexity; financial system; investment; standardization
Can we learn lessons from the past?

The pandemic has also threatened the survival of the firms, which has drawn the attention of policymakers and corporate governance practitioners around the world. In this study, we focus on how corporate governance practices can help firms to survive during COVID-19 crisis. For this purpose, we take insights from prior crises by reviewing leading business journals articles and identify key corporate governance mechanisms that could potentially be effective in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Our review of a large body of literature highlights several governance mechanisms that may help firms to cope with COVID-19 crisis. These governance attributes include risk management committees, board diversity, independent directors, foreign investors, institutional ownership, ownership concentration, CEO's dual roles, block ownership, and family ownership. We provide several policy implications after reviewing the corporate governance literature. Our review illustrates that firms may be subject to at least one of the identified governance mechanisms and they may learn how these governance attributes can be effective in the COVID-19 crisis. Our review illustrates that independent risk management committees, institutional ownership, board independence, blockholders, and family ownership are some of the essential and effective governance mechanisms compared to other governance attributes during COVID-19 crisis. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Corporate governance; COVID-19; financial crisis,COVID-19; epidemic; financial crisis; governance approach; literature review; policy making; risk assessment

Financial savings structure—Eurozone and Visegrad Group,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099061926&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2445&partnerID=40&md5=e45a902a0e1ae209e42cfd2258ee4d98,"The purpose of the analysis presented in this text is to identify differences in the structure of financial assets between countries (Eurozone countries and Visegrad Group countries). All groups of forms of saving analyzed are characterized by strong or very strong asymmetry. To compensate for the worrying calculations, the outlier effect has been standardized using weber median. Further statistical analyses used Friedman's non-aparametric ANOVA test to determine the similarity between the different forms of saving. The PROFIT analysis allowed for a graphical representation of the structure of the similarities between the countries analyzed and their arrangement due to the severity of the selected forms of saving. The analysis showed that in the Eurozone countries the form of saving significantly different from the others turned out to be Equity and investment fund shares, while in the countries of Visegrad Group they are loans and other accounts receivable/payable. In addition, the Netherlands and Estonia were the most outliers in the Eurozone countries, followed by Slovakia and Hungary in the Visegrad Group countries. The results of the analysis may complement the literature on household savings, which are the primary, saving sector of any economy. The dominance of savings only in the form of deposits and currencies can in the long term cause monetary distortions. Determining the share of financial instruments in financial assets and indicating the diversity between regions can be important in the development of financial policy as it indicates differences in economies of varying degrees of development. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",currency and deposits; debt securities; households; loans; Median Weber; PROFIT,Estonia; Europe; currency; European Union; financial market; financial system; lending behavior; monetary policy; parameter estimation
The stability and downside risk to contrarian profits: Evidence from the S&P 500,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099058596&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2447&partnerID=40&md5=51d238e077543b609f996091146cc90e,"A large literature now reports the evidence for the profitability of contrarian trading strategies. We investigate the stability of such contrarian trading strategies and their ability to generate large, potentially ruinous, losses for their users. Specifically, we ask, are the annual profits earned by contrarian strategies sufficiently stable and loss-free to keep their adherents in the game and capable of reaping returns to such long-run trading strategies? We present tests with more statistical power than hitherto, reflecting practical aspects of the operation of contrarian strategies. Specifically, the strategies are implemented only for years in which the mean return of stocks in the buy portfolio exceeds that of the sell portfolio; in addition, for each strategy, we calculate the Calmar ratio as a measure of downside risk. Using the constituents of the S&P 500 index for the years 1990–2017 inclusive, we examine a variety of simple, ratio-based strategies and more complicated strategies based on formal valuation models. Overall, our evaluation makes us sceptical about the reliability of contrarian strategies as currently formulated. But of those strategies available, those based on discounted cash flow seem most likely to be profitable. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",asset pricing benchmarks; contrarian profits; fast and frugal; market efficiency; S&P 500,benchmarking; market conditions; profitability

Annual data were collected from 1986 to 2019 from the State Bank of Pakistan, and time series analysis co-integration and vector error correlation model have been applied. We found that only two variables, real wage and non-agricultural wage, are affected in the long run while the OS is not affected in the long run. There is no short-term effect of any variable except real wage and non-agricultural wage. It is recommended that the government should invest in the human capital of both agriculture and industrial sectors to overcome the problem of unequal functional income distribution in Pakistan. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",non-agricultural wage; operating surplus; real wage; VECM test,Pakistan; annual variation; cointegration analysis; error analysis; income distribution; wage determination

The impact of COVID-19 on unemployment rate: An intelligent based unemployment rate prediction in selected countries of Europe,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099214643&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2434&partnerID=40&md5=101003353dce8f104998fa4cdab2f649,"Unemployment remains a major cause for both developed and developing nations, due to which they lose their financial and economic impact as a whole. Unemployment rate prediction achieved researcher attention from a fast few years. The intention of doing our research is to examine the impact of the coronavirus on the unemployment rate. Accurately predicting the unemployment rate is a stimulating job for policymakers, which plays an imperative role in a country's financial and financial development planning. Classical time series models such as ARIMA models and advanced non-linear time series methods be previously hired for unemployment rate prediction. It is known to us that mostly these data sets are non-linear as well as non-stationary. Consequently, a random error can be produced by a distinct time series prediction model. Our research considers hybrid prediction approaches supported by linear and non-linear models to preserve forecast the unemployment rates much precisely. These hybrid approaches of the unemployment rate can advance their estimates by reproducing the unemployment ratio irregularity. These models' appliance is exposed to six unemployment rate statistics sets from Europe's selected countries, specifically France, Spain, Belgium, Turkey, Italy and Germany. Among these hybrid models, the hybrid ARIMA-ARNN forecasting model performed well for France, Belgium, Turkey and Germany, whereas hybrid ARIMA-SVM performed outclass for Spain and Italy. Furthermore, these models are used for the best future prediction. Results show that the unemployment rate will be higher in the coming years, which is the consequence of the coronavirus, and it will take at least 5 years to overcome the impact of COVID-19 in these countries. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",artificial neural networks; corona virus; hybrid modeling approach; nonlinear; prediction; prediction; support vector machines; unemployment rate,Europe; artificial neural network; COVID-19; economic impact; modeling; nonlinearity; prediction; support vector machine; unemployment
Investor sentiment and volatility of exchange-traded funds: Evidence from China,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099926392&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2443&partnerID=40&md5=0688745720ac488a8c5bc99b28c63fa8,"This study examines the relationship between fund-level investor sentiment and return volatility of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). We use the first principle component to form a composite fund-level investor sentiment index that is based on the common variation in four underlying proxies for individual fund sentiment for each ETF: relative strengthen index, psychological line index, Bull and Bear Index and trading volume. And we employ the GARCH model and the EGARCH model to estimate daily ETFs' return volatility, respectively. In our tests, the panel data regressive analysis reveals that investor sentiment reliably predicts ETFs' return volatility in different periods of sentiment state. Specifically, return volatility increases with investor sentiment in the periods of high-sentiment state, and decreases with investor sentiment in the periods of low-sentiment state. Furthermore, the panel quantile regression results exhibit nonlinear patterns across the quantiles obviously: weaker effects for lower quantiles and stronger effects for higher quantiles in general. More importantly, the empirical results are stable across different conditional variance models. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",behavior finance; exchange-traded funds; individual fund sentiment; investor sentiment; return volatility,China; behavior; financial market; investment; panel data; regression analysis

Predictive regressions support no predictability; in contrast, our results in the frequency domain verify significant predictability at medium and long horizons. To robustify predictability patterns, the analysis is executed repetitively for fixed-length rolling samples of various sizes. Overall, the stock returns are predictable for wavelengths higher than 5 years.

To shed light on country-level factors that can mitigate crisis and potential capital outflows across these countries, this article investigates which factors have influenced the evolution of their current accounts. Our analyses, using dynamic ordinary least squares, suggest that the long-run determinants of the current account have indeed changed over time, and threshold cointegrated estimates also confirm that, for each country, the parameters are dependent on thresholds for certain variables and there is significant heterogeneity across the countries. Our overall results are robust to complementary analyses, such as threshold estimation approach. We comment on some possible implications of these differences. © 2021 The Authors.

Simulation of interactive contagion between depositors' panic and banking risk,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099363497&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2426&partnerID=40&md5=ac17fc993b838f9d5651404531f1ebea,"Contagion (spread of harmful idea) and control of bank risk have been an eternal topic in the field of financial research. In this paper, we firstly use the savings mechanism to combine the social network of depositors with the network of balance sheets in the banking system to build multiple networks for the banking industry. Secondly, aiming at the heterogeneity of depositors, construct an improved SIS model based on node attitudes to represent the decision-making process of a bank run during the spread of panic emotions in social networks. Finally, three sets of simulation experiments were designed using a multi-agent model to analyse the interaction between bank risk contagion and depositor panic contagion under initial asset shocks, the sensitivity of two types of risk contagion, and bank risk contagion under initial rumour shocks. Results show that: (i) The contagion of bank risks and the spread of panic emotions of depositors will affect each other, which will further expand the scope of the spread of bank risk and panic emotions; (ii) depositors in social networks are more likely to be affected by the negative emotions around them; (iii) The key to stabilizing the banking system, while sufficient liquidity can effectively help the banking system resist rumour attacks. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",banking risk; complex network; multi-agent; panic contagion; simulation,banking; decision making; financial market; financial services; numerical model

Moreover, it allows provision for speculative future currency trading. This article shows that currency salam is prohibited in the light of Islamic rules of riba. Researchers have held three positions about modern currencies. The paper shows that the permissibility of currency salam is derived by combining together these three irreconcilable views about modern currencies. In other words, currency salam is the outcome of a fallacious methodology known as talfeeq which is merely a device of creating legal artifices (hiyal) for satisfying one's desires. It is argued that the permission of currency salam must be rejected because it is riba and it opens up the flood-gate for financial speculations in the name of Islam. The paper also attempts to draw attention of the regulatory authorities to tackle this issue seriously as it will adversely affect the trust on Islamic banking regarding its Shariah compliance. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,banking; compliance; currency; Islamism

Furthermore, it was established that the quantile approach used to test for the first- and second-order dominance does not work under the third-order. If these points are overlooked, it is possible to conclude that an investment is third-order inefficient when it is actually efficient. Also, an inefficient investment may not be relegated to the inefficient set. In this work, to test for third-order efficiency, we derive the expressions for the functions essential for testing the possibility of third-order stochastic dominance at the interior points and arrive at their restrictions on the common grid of the pairwise investments under consideration. We also develop a program to determine the efficient funds and the funds superior and inferior to the benchmark indices at a fast pace. We find that the size of the efficient set reduces drastically under third-order. Also, several funds are found to be superior to the indices under second- and third-order. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",first-order stochastic dominance algorithm; investment analysis; second-order stochastic dominance algorithm; third-order stochastic dominance algorithm,algorithm; investment; stochasticity

We deploy a newly developed financial development dataset and Lewbel instrumental variable two-step GMM estimator (IV–GMM), with Kleibergen–Paap robust SEs and orthogonal statistics in establishing our empirical relationships over the period 1990–2017. Initial estimations at the overall level of the real sector, manufacturing, and industry show that FDI has no growth effects, and even worsens growth of the agriculture sector. On decomposing the real sector, we found the interaction between FDI and financial development to enhance the growth of the real sector and its components at face value. However, our marginal effect analysis shows that the growth impact of FDI on the overall real sector, industry, and service sector growth starts at the threshold level of the 25th percentile of financial development, while the growth impact on manufacturing is only evident at the 90th percentile of financial development. Although financial development aids FDI in projecting the growth of the agriculture sector, their interaction cannot wholly eradicate the initial adverse impact from FDI. The results are robust to determinants of growth. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Africa; FDI; financial development; instrumental variables; value additions,Africa; agriculture; empirical analysis; finance; foreign direct investment; growth; manufacturing

The literature review reveals that magnetic resonance imaging has been significantly used worldwide compared to other imaging diagnoses. This study aimed to determine the number of unnecessary MRIs in 2015, 2016, and 2017, thus reducing them using the obtained information. Methods and materials: This descriptive-analytical and Retrospective study was carried out in 2015, 2016, and 2017. The Cochran formula was used to determine the sample volume: where P = q = 0.5 at the significance level of 5%, and N represented the statistical population. Since the number of hospitalized MRIs during these three years was 1,617, 1,499, and 2,090, the sample size was 310, 305, and 325. Finally, 940 cases were included in the study. The samples were randomly selected. MRI request indexes design and data were collected based on the AIM guidelines. Finally, by choosing specific indications based on the brain and spinal MRI guidelines and adding indications to software and data, they were analyzed using the SPSS23 software and chi-square test. Chi - squares test was used to measure the significance of the data. Results: According to the present study and based on the indications and diagnoses related to brain and spinal cord diseases extracted from inpatients' records, 20% of prescriptions were unnecessary; of all unnecessary requested MRIs, 70.8% related to the brain and 29.2% to the spine. Moreover, the notable point was the lack of MRI response in 18.3% of the cases. In this study, 35% (most) of the unnecessary MRIs were prescribed by physicians with non-neurological and non-orthopedic specialties. On the other hand, non-stamped MRI requests accounted for a significantly higher share of unnecessary MRIs (49.8%). Examining physicians' type of activity and work experience shows that the highest share of unnecessary prescriptions (almost 50%) was related to physicians' non-stamped records. Conclusion: Factors such as professional certainty, more time for examination, prescription of MRI by a related physician, supervision of professors of the medical department on the prescriptions of less experienced physicians, failure to perform MRI of unstamped files by master or residents by the imaging center, and the need to use indications Guideline-compliant prescriptions can reduce unnecessary patient and health system. So, it is essential to consider some aspects for reducing unnecessary requests in any subject of the health system. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Brain; MRI; spine; unnecessary MRI; unnecessary request,Iran; Tehran [Iran]; brain; health care; health status; literature review; public health
Uncovered equity returns parity in non-euro Central European EU member countries,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099070215&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2422&partnerID=40&md5=bd5bc5e7b5ec3428cf086bc8b9e590f1,"This paper examines a nexus between euro values of local currencies and returns to equities in non-euro Central European countries (CECs) relative to returns in a global equity market. In essence, it analyses whether the uncovered equity returns parity (UERP) condition holds in these countries. In theory, the UERP condition holds if higher returns in a local equity market relative to the global market returns are offset by the local currency depreciation. The underlying UERP model examines the relationship between local currencies in euro and CEC equity returns relative to a global market index proxied by Wilshire5000 index. We assume that the UERP relationship is country-sensitive, time-dependent and state-dependent, that is, it varies among countries and depends on economic and financial market conditions. The model is tested with the Bai–Perron multiple breakpoint regressions for structural breaks, as well as the two-state Markov switching test for state dependence, during the January 4, 1999–February 25, 2020 sample period. We find that UERP condition holds in CECs mainly at times of financial distress, including the peak and the aftermath of the 2008–2010 global financial crisis. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Central European countries; equity returns; exchange rates; uncovered equity returns parity condition,Central Europe; currency; equity; exchange rate; financial crisis; financial market

Using the data panel including economic and demographic trends in the countries of this region in the period from year 2006 to 2016, it is determined that price stability and higher deposit rates may cause faster development of insurance market. Contrary to previous findings, which indicate wages and population ageing as key driving factors in developed countries, in this region these are the youth dependency and care for their schooling. This indicates that a higher significance is given to the component of insurance of death risk than the savings one. However, during crisis period, more than post-crisis period, higher demand for this type of savings was determined due to the decline in confidence in banking sector. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Financial crisis; financial market; life insurance; premium reserve; western Balkans,Balkans; banking; demography; economic analysis; financial crisis; financial market; insurance system; savings

The findings of the study confirm that strong cybersecurity reduces the consequences of cyber threats to financial inclusion. This study suggests that numerous external and internal factors lead to criminals for illegal activities in the banking sector. Therefore, it is obligatory for the banks to enhance their cybersecurity control, to minimize the occurrences of cyber-attacks.

Banks' holdings of and trading in government bonds,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099065991&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2419&partnerID=40&md5=ae7a014bd5d7a177c3d33daba6f790b2,"In this paper we examine the holdings of government securities by domestic banks along those of the foreign banks/non-banks/official sector as well as the domestic central bank and domestic non-banks, using data for 21 advanced economies from 2004Q1 to 2016Q2. The research offers four main insights. Firstly, banks are reluctant to undertake large changes in their holdings of domestic bonds but do accept frequent changes of more intermediate size. Secondly, the foreign official sector emerges as the clearest example of contrarian investor, which buys when prices fall and sells when prices rise. Thirdly, the yields of 10-year benchmark sovereign bonds tend to be lower the larger the holdings by domestic and foreign banks are. Finally, we find in all countries of the sample a positive home bias in banks' sovereign holdings while foreign banks hold less than predicted by a neutral portfolio measure. These results suggest that banks regard domestic government bonds as a special asset class (hence the positive bias and the avoidance of large changes in inventories) which they manage in a flexible manner (hence the frequent intermediate changes and the lack of systematic timing of transactions) probably to meet requests from their customers. All in all, this behavior by domestic banks provides a positive contribution to the liquidity of the market as a whole. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",government bond yields; investor holdings; panel cointegration,central bank; cointegration analysis; debt; financial market; trade

This paper introduces and analyses a new sample of European Union (EU) banks, which faced distress during 2008–2015 and provides evidence regarding the relationship between distress and bank-specific, macroeconomic, banking sector and stock market distress determinants, paying particular attention to issues that have been central following the crisis, such as capital, size and revenue diversification. Our findings regarding these variables seem to “connect” well with current supervisory actions. The paper also focuses on banks in EU countries that faced economic problems and documents that the probability of distress in these countries has been influenced by different factors, in comparison to the rest of the EU. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bank distress; capital ratios; European union banks; GIIPS; revenue diversification; size,Europe; banking; capital; European Union; financial crisis; firm size

The predictive power of the social media sentiment index and Internet news sentiment index in the full sample is excellent, far better than that of the macroeconomic predictors, whereas the index established based on the traditional newspaper is unsatisfactory. The forecasting results of the indices across different business cycles imply that the social media sentiment index has the best predictive power during expansion periods, and the Internet news sentiment index significantly predicts stock returns during recessions. The two combination sentiment indices obtained by principal component analysis and equal combination provide more accurate forecasts of stock returns and can generate great economic value for investors. These results are broadly consistent across robustness tests. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Chinese stock market; forecasting; sentiment index; stock return,China; business cycle; forecasting method; Internet; mass media; principal component analysis; social media; stock market
Impact of bank regulation on risk of Islamic and conventional banks,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099462387&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2462&partnerID=40&md5=1d42b54bc763c9d87d2e48157a338d5a,"We analyse the impact of bank regulation on the risks of Islamic banks (IBs) and conventional banks (CBs) between 2004 and 2015 by employing 455 CBs and 95 IBs from 22 countries where IBs and CBs coexist. Since the objective of Basel regulations is to achieve a stable banking sector by mitigating risks, we examine the impact of bank regulations on various risks of IBs and CBs by using a regression framework. We examine solvency risk, credit risk, idiosyncratic risk and systemic risk by using capital oversight, restriction on activities, private monitoring and supervisory power bank regulation data provided by the World Bank. The findings show that though the Basel regulations were originally developed for CBs, our results imply that they are effective for IBs as well as CBs. However, our study also shows that regulations affect IBs and CBs differently as their business models are different. More targeted regulations towards IBs would be necessary to support IBs. Additionally, in regions with higher economic freedom indexes, banking regulations can mitigate the risk of IBs and CBs to a greater extent. Our results imply that the combination of free economic policies and banking supervision addresses risks in banking effectively. Finally, the bank regulations did not appear to be able to control the risk of the sample banks during the 2007–2009 crisis. Hence, the Basel committee needs to rethink about regulations during crisis times. © 2021 The Authors.

The role of corporate governance in attracting foreign investment: An empirical investigation of Saudi-listed firms in light of vision 2030,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099873883&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2420&partnerID=40&md5=e841237b8862a1a28337024b282de054,"Following the introduction of the Saudi Vision 2030, diverse developments have been considered concerning corporate governance as an effort to open Saudi Arabia's economy to the world. Identifying the significance of attracting foreign investment is considered an approach to accomplish one of the vision's targets. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of improved corporate governance policies on the magnitude of foreign investment. Regression analysis was employed using the data of 153 listed companies in the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) from 2015 to 2019 to examine the effect of three corporate governance indicators on foreign investment. Specifically, ownership structure was represented by institutional ownership, ownership concentration and managerial ownership. Board composition was identified by board size and independence. Executive pay was measured by the total top executive pay and the presence of long-term incentive plans (LTIPs). Findings indicated that foreign investment is positively associated with ownership concentration, board independence and the presence of LTIPs in compensation packages. A negative and significant association was found with institutional ownership and managerial ownership. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",agency theory; corporate governance; foreign investment; managerial ownership; ownership structure,Saudi Arabia; empirical analysis; foreign direct investment; ownership; stock market

Contrarily, the moral hazard hypothesis, under which banks practise excessive lending to relatively risky borrowers that pay higher premium but increase their credit risk, is supported in the pre-crisis period and for small banks. Additionally, we provide important implications to suggest that the post-crisis regulations have restrained banks with poor performance from the ‘gamble to survive’ behaviour. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bank lending; bank performance; bank risk; financial crisis; loan pricing,Europe; banking; debt; financial crisis; financial market; risk

A credit scoring model for SMEs using AHP and TOPSIS,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099264388&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2425&partnerID=40&md5=0f82ef9fcdd82143bbbc5ed2c07efff7,"Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have played a significant role in the development of any economy. However, easy access to finance from financial institutions is a prime challenge for them. Similarly, financial institutions also face difficulties while selecting the potential SMEs for granting credit. The SMEs are often seen as unorganized in terms of financial data as compared to large corporate sectors. The credit risk assessment based on unorganized financial data is a challenge for financial institutions. Most of the existing models used regression to predict the possibility of default of SMEs. However, the regression model may not perform well with limited data points and missing data. The problem can be solved by using a multi criteria decision-making (MCDM) model. Credit scoring, especially addressing the SMEs, has been infrequently reported in the archived literature. To fill the gaps of literature, the present study proposes a credit scoring model applying the hybrid analytic hierarchy process-technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (AHP-TOPSIS) technique. The study has been carried out in three stages. In the first stage, credit rating criteria and sub-criteria have been identified from the literature review and taking opinions from experts. In the second stage, weights of criteria and sub-criteria have been calculated using AHP. Finally, in the third stage, weights calculated by AHP have been used in TOPSIS to determine the credit score. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been illustrated through a case study. Further, the results of the proposed model are compared with the commercially available ratings. The proposed model may be a low-cost alternative for financial institutions for credit scoring of SMEs. Further, the model has the advantage of customization as per the needs of the financial institutions. The suggested model can help the managers to identify the potential SMEs for granting credit. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",AHP; credit scoring model; financial institutions; MCDM; SMEs; TOPSIS,analytical hierarchy process; credit provision; financial market; financial services; financial system; small and medium-sized enterprise
Does corporate tax planning mitigate financial constraints? Evidence from China,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099052384&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2433&partnerID=40&md5=7eb26d639f3f4ca0eeacae1b896f8eaa,"We hypothesize that tax planning behaviour mitigates a firm's financial constraints, and this effect is more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises and big firms compared to their counterparts. We use data for Chinese listed firms during the period 2010–2018 to test the hypotheses, based on both ordinary least squares and fixed-effect models. The regression results show that tax planning is positively and significantly associated with mitigation of financial constraints, suggesting that cash tax savings are likely to improve firms' financial slack. This effect is stronger for non-state-owned enterprises, big firms, non-political firms and firms in the eastern region of China. Further analyses reveal that, in the long run, tax planning increases firms' financial constraints, supporting Scholes-Wolfson's point of view of tax planning, that minimizing taxes is not the same as effective tax planning. These results are robust to various tests. Overall, our results suggest that minimizing tax generally produces immediate cash flow benefits and mitigates financial constraints in the short run; however, in the long run, firms should adopt sustainable financing strategies. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",financial constraints; firm size; state-owned enterprises; tax planning,China; financial crisis; financial market; financial policy; firm size; state owned enterprise; tax system
The effect of Confucian culture on household risky asset holdings: Using categorical principal component analysis,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099054843&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2452&partnerID=40&md5=06f185bba4dd0dc2205974188d07aa5f,"Confucianism, as an informal system, influences the risk preferences of households and, therefore, affects households' investment behaviours. This study investigates the effects of Confucian culture on household risky assets by using data from the 2016 China Family Panel Studies and using categorical principal component analysis. The empirical results reveal that Confucian culture is negatively correlated with risky assets held by households. Specifically, households more influenced by Confucian culture demonstrate a low probability of participating in the risky financial market and a decreased proportion of risky asset holdings. Further research indicates that this negative correlation is diminished in areas with high levels of social trust. Furthermore, foreign culture impact drives households to enter financial markets. Therefore, the Chinese government must thoroughly consider the potential effects of culture when formulating policies, utilize Confucian culture's adaptation to modern society and promote the healthy development of the financial market. This study augments the household finance theory from the perspective of informal systems and contributes to the research on ‘culture and finance.’. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",CATPCA; Confucianism; culture; household risky assets,China; cultural economy; cultural influence; financial market; governance approach; household expenditure; household income; housing finance; investment; principal component analysis; risk assessment; theoretical study

The results suggest that higher investor protection leads to the accumulation of more cash. Besides, a powerful country-level framework controls the value-destroying activities of firm managers. The results also support the flexibility hypothesis by providing evidence that strong CR in the economy lead to higher CH by the managers. Finally, investor protection in the presence of high CR reduces the incentive to hold more cash supporting stewardship theory in these markets.

The effectiveness of this policy remains an ongoing debate and largely limited to theoretical assertions. Using a dataset of 9,638 banks from 41 countries over the period 2009–2018, and a Difference-in-Differences estimator, this paper examines whether the adoption of a negative interest rate policy has any effect on bank lending margins. We find that bank margins have contracted in countries where negative rates have been implemented. Our results suggest that, in a negative interest rate environment, the rate on loans declines faster than the rate on retail deposits. Moreover, we show that the effects of negative interest rate policy (NIRP) on bank lending margins were stronger for smaller, less capitalized, deposit-dependent banks. Finally, our findings indicate that banks reliant on retail deposits increased lending in response to NIRP. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bank margins; deposit rate; difference-in-differences estimation; loan rate; negative interest rates,banking; debt; econometrics; financial crisis; interest rate; monetary policy

Investigating the role of ranking household expenditures to reform the subsidies payment system as an economic policy for Iran,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099058380&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2413&partnerID=40&md5=beacbbd50cde0e5c8b3d2cab11a4a1a3,"Given the problems created by the high volume of subsidies and their significant share in government budgets, as well as, the failure to achieve the governmental goals in the field of subsidies, reform of the subsidies payment system has constantly been a concern of various governments. The welfare of society, especially the low-income groups, has always been the focus of governments. To this end, subsidies are paid, particularly for basic goods, with the aim of decreasing prices and increasing purchasing power. However, since such payments are not targeted, a major part of subsidies will be granted to the upper classes and high-income deciles. Therefore, targeting subsidies and paying attention to prioritizing costs in the household basket regarding subsidies payment will be an undeniable necessity. Currently, Iran faces fundamental problems in equitable management and distribution of subsidies, and the distribution of subsidies is extremely unfair. Given the importance of this issue and in order to provide a solution to reform the subsidy structure of Iran, present paper tries to examine the share of consuming expenditures in Iranian households using econometric methods and thus establish as a basis for ranking the costs. Accordingly, as a policy on targeting subsidies, we also aim to provide policymakers with better ways to implement policies. In general, the results indicate that targeting the subsidies in the household sector is different due to the different share of costs in the household budget and implementing the same approach to policy of targeting the subsidies is not appropriate for all households. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",equitable distribution; household's expenditure basket; ranking; targeting the subsidies,Iran; economic policy; household expenditure; ranking; subsidy system
Is the cost of equity a mere function of leverage?

Using a sample of nearly 600 firms that have gone through a bond IPO over the 1980–2014 period, we show that the change in the cost of equity that results is not just a function of leverage influencing the risk of residual owners. The information and monitoring environment, and agency relationships of a firm change significantly with its first public debt, and these changes can have a significant impact on the firm's cost of equity. We find that firms that have relatively high information asymmetry before they undertake the bond IPO experience less of a rise in their cost of equity than firms with relatively low information asymmetry consistent with these firms benefitting from improvements in their information environment as a result of the IPO. We also show that firms with high pre-bond IPO free cash flow see less of an increase in their cost of equity than firms with low pre-bond IPO free cash flow consistent with the disciplining mechanism of additional debt and the benefit from additional monitoring. In addition, we find that firms with poor corporate governance experience less of an increase in their cost of equity after the bond IPO than firms with better corporate governance. The evidence suggests that the change in the riskiness of equity after a firm goes through a bond IPO is much more complex than what is predicted by the leverage increase. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bond; corporate governance; cost of equity; IPO; leverage,corporate strategy; cost analysis; debt

The findings also revealed a negative relationship between innovation and economic growth and between trade and economic growth. The paper concludes that further regulation of financial systems and the quality of funding are important ingredients to foster economic development. The paper also concludes that country-specific characteristics can play an important role in fostering innovation and productivity. Furthermore, policymakers should improve institutional quality and improve the regulatory environment in order to benefit more from trade openness. Also, policy makers need to use innovation incentives for local companies in order to counteract the negative effects induced by market opening. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",economic growth; european countries; financial development; innovation; panel VAR modelling; trade openness,Europe; economic growth; financial services; financial system; innovation; panel data; trade openness

This paper aims at studying the Tunisian exchange rate regime over the post-revolution period. It uses daily data from 2010 to 2019. The empirical results show that the Tunisian de facto regime is broadly consistent with the IMF classification. Nevertheless, the IMF stated that in 2018 the EUR is the only anchor, but this study shows that from 2017 the implicit weight of the USD becomes higher than the EUR. Most of the time, there is a discrepancy between the regime claimed by the Tunisian authority and the de facto regime detected by the model. Annual regressions, the Chow, and the Bai-Perron breakpoint tests show that the Tunisian de facto regime is not stable. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",de facto regime; de jure regime; exchange rate; fear of floating,Tunisia; empirical analysis; exchange rate; financial crisis; financial market; financial services; IMF

We find that FL and ML exhibit a large-and-positive mutual impact when money market is tight and equity market is volatile. But in normal regimes, FL is found to have a negative impact on ML with a much smaller magnitude than those in stressed regimes. Furthermore, FL is more stable than ML with less regime changes. Our article offers insight on the important mechanism by which central banks can improve ML through the funding market. © 2021 The Authors.

A span of continuous trades and liquidity dynamics in foreign exchange markets,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098272047&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2410&partnerID=40&md5=f757874dae954a684a6a25a88bd221cc,"This study incorporates the spans of sequences of continuous trades and reversal trades to investigate whether the currency liquidity is varying with the span of continuous trades or reversal trades. We highlight the dependency between the span of continuous trades and the realized bid-ask spread to explain the currency liquidity dynamics using high-frequency foreign exchange data. Our findings show that the spans of continuous trades play an important role in determining the market liquidity because a larger span of a continuous sequence puts a drain on the market liquidity and thereby consumes the funding liquidity, eventually increasing the bid-ask spread. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bid-ask spread; foreign exchange market; market liquidity; span of continuous trade,currency market; data; exchange rate; trade
"The crypto-trade volume, GDP, energy use, and environmental degradation sustainability: An analysis of the top 20 crypto-trader countries",2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098271230&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2442&partnerID=40&md5=a880db6c527c8e8d7dc1e015914b6be4,"The global ecosystem and human life are both endangered due to the amount of CO2 emission discharged into the natural environment. The exponential crypto-trade growth, high density of modern technology, and rapidly changing technological needs of human beings have experienced an unresolved problem in environmental sustainability and poisonous emissions in the top 20 crypto-trader countries. This research paper investigates the empirical impact of crypto-volume, gross domestic product (GDP), and energy use on environmental sustainability. The CO2 emission is considered as a proxy of environmental degradation in the top 20 crypto-trader countries. The cross-sectional dependence and data homogeneity are checked by employing panel unit root and cointegration techniques for 2012–2019. The study's empirical findings indicated a long-run relationship between CO2 emission, crypto-volume, GDP, and energy use. The long-run relationship confirmation was also received from the fully modified ordinary least square, dynamic ordinary least square, and vector error correction model (VECM). The VECM verifies bidirectional causality between environmental degradation and crypto-volume for long- and short-term and unidirectional causality for GDP and energy use. In this modern age, not only crypto-trading but also energy use and GDP are interlinked with e-wastage, which significantly disturbed environmental sustainability, leading to emissions and climate change. The adverse effects of crypto-trade, GDP, and energy use increase inequalities. This research recommends to governments and fiscal policymakers to de-socialize high energy-consuming blockchain technology. It replaces it with green and less energy-consuming technology to reduce the negative environmental impact of externalities. Furthermore, appropriate green fiscal reforms should follow to minimize the impacts of CO2 emission. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",crypto-trader countries; crypto-volume; energy use; environmental sustainability; GDP,carbon emission; currency; energy use; environmental degradation; Gross Domestic Product; sustainability; trade
Household choices on investing in financial risky assets: Do national institutional factors have their own merit?,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098289041&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2427&partnerID=40&md5=163ab9ef1ffdbcaac066028aa26ea8ee,"Using data from household surveys in United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and United States, spanning the period 2009–2018, we examine the institutional basis of households' portfolio choice decisions as related to investments in financial risky assets. We document that governance matters for households' investment decisions. A decomposition of the institutional factor effects on portfolio allocation reveals that a high degree of judicial independence and property rights protection drive households to invest in riskier assets.

Africa as the recipient of aid over this period is still wallowing in poverty and underdevelopment. This phenomenon has interested many researchers and donor agencies to unravel the true impact of aid to the developmental agenda of Africa but the findings are mixed and inconsistent. Our study focused on 50 African countries for the period of 1996 to 2017 on a panel study. The study adopts panel data methodologies such as generalized linear model, Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data estimations (GMM two-step approach), and granger causality to achieve our objective of identifying the linear and dynamic relationship among the variables. Foreign aid through developmental assistance is assumed to significantly impact growth but the results from our study report an opposing view thus negative and statistically linear and dynamic relationship. Moreover, the undermining factors hindering aid-growth relationships in Africa are high levels of corruption, poverty, low level of human development, political instability, and poor institutional quality. On this note, we would like to recommend to policymakers to focus on technical assistance and educational projects that could strengthen institutions rather than other developmental projects. In essence, these would propagate development in the immediate time to promote long-run growth agenda. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Democracy; Economic growth; Foreign aid; Governments' effectiveness; Political stability,Africa; democracy; development aid; economic growth; international aid; political relations; state role

The dynamic panel data analyses are distinct in that they comprehensively examine various network effects by integrating two branches of globalization topics: trade–migration relationships and trade–foreign direct investment (FDI) relationships. The results show that international royalty and license revenues are positively related with immigrants residing in Japan, but that networks created through Japanese emigrants, FDI inflows to Japan and Japanese direct investment abroad do not display significant relationships. The results imply that either some network effects do not exist, or that they do exist but are offset by other effects. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",emigration; foreign direct investment; immigration; intellectual property; license fees; service surplus,Japan; business development; emigration; foreign direct investment; immigration; intellectual property rights; migration; OECD

To refine inference about stationarity in the presence of structural breaks, the study employed the Lee and Strazicich and Zivot-Andrews stationarity tests, which all confirmed that the series are integrated of order one. Both the ARDL bound testing for cointegration and the Johansen cointegration approach all confirmed long-run relationship among the variables. From the cointegrating regression estimates using the Saikkonen and Stock-Watson Dynamic Ordinary Least Square procedure and the Phillip and Hansen's Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square technique, we found that imports in Nigeria are domestic inflation or cross elastic in the long run. The study, however, found import demand to be inelastic to EXR and income, same as to foreign exchange reserves. The sensitivity of these estimates was confirmed with the ARDL procedure suggested by Peseran, Shin and Smith. With the Granger non-causality test using the Toda-Yamamoto's technique, we found unidirectional causality running from domestic inflation to import demand, implying that previous values of domestic inflation offer additional information to explaining future values of aggregate import demand. Diversification of domestic production as well as other policies directed at enhancing price and quality competiveness of domestic products were recommended. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",cross elasticity; DOLS; FMOLS; import demand function; Toda–Yamamoto; Zivot–Andrews,Nigeria; cointegration analysis; demand elasticity; exchange rate; Granger causality test; Gross Domestic Product; import; inflation; least squares method; regression analysis

The estimated model uses Pooled Mean Group technique on a sample of 44 countries of sub-Saharan Africa during 1980–2017. It emerges that trade has a positive and significant influence on per capita income in the sub-Saharan zone. This positive effect can also be empowered by improving the level of governance and by ethnic fragmentation. This fact shows the importance of a good political governance and the mastering of trade policies to gain more from trade openness for these countries. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",economic growth; governance; international trade; PMG model; sub-Saharan Africa,Sub-Saharan Africa; economic growth; ethnicity; governance approach; income; international trade; modeling; trade openness; trade policy

After conducting an ordinary least square(OLS) regression, we find that the more frequent fund corporations site visits lead to better fund performance, and that is more evident for moderate-sized fund corporations. The results suggest that institutional investors obtain increased profit when they are diligent.

By applying the system generalized method of moments (GMM) technique, the results show that the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, with a 1-year lag, has a robust effect on economic growth. Both per capita domestic value-added (PCDVA) and institutional quality (IQ) exhibit a positive impact on economic growth in the long-run performance compared to the short-run performance. Human capital (HC) suggests statistical significance and adverse impact on economic growth in the short and long runs. However, our key variable of interest, namely the regional integration dummy variable (free trade area, FTA), has no robust effect on economic growth and exhibits insignificant effects across all interaction models and shows “inverted-U interaction relationships” with trade openness, intra-community export, and PCDVA. Other regional economic communities shows a statistically significant negative effect on the GDP per capita in both the short and long runs as well as in its interactions with FTA. The study suggests, among others, that there is a need for COMESA to address the issue of overlapping membership and to promote appropriate PCDVA, IQ, financial development, and HC policies and strategies to boost the economic growth of the member states. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Free trade area; intra-community export; ORECs; per capita domestic value-added; regional integration; sustainability,East Africa; South Africa; economic analysis; economic development; economic growth; Free Trade Area; Gross Domestic Product; regional economy; sustainability

Second, the expected real growth rate is increasing in the capital stock, which leads to a twin-peak shape of the world wealth distribution as shown in the data. With respect to financial markets, we show that the equity risk premium is reduced by the endogenous discounting and exhibits a cyclical pattern, which depends on the capital stock.

Income redistribution depends upon how the process of devolution is premeditated and implemented. This study reveals the empirical evidences on the effect of different types of intergovernmental transfers/grants, under NFC awards, on household income inequality using a sample of panel data of provincial units in Pakistan from 1990 to 2015. Empirical underpinnings contemplate that straight transfers and non-development grants have taken on the greater change in reducing income inequality and thus have made the utmost attempt to guarantee the equal distribution of revenues among the federating units. On contrary, the divisible pool transfers, augment the income inequality. Remarkably, even if devolution could be attractive due to efficiency reasons, it may have uninvited consequences on the income distribution. Further development grants indicate no relation to household income inequality. These results also have obvious policy implications as the normative scheme governs intergovernmental regional transfers in case of divisible pool transfers in Pakistan which must be revised, and focus should be given on implementation, if the objective is to confer the country' greater territorial cohesion. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",fiscal decentralization; household income inequality; intergovernmental transfers; NFC awards; panel data,Pakistan; fiscal policy; government; household income; income distribution; panel data

Consequently, we consider two categories of U.S. stocks—defensive and non-defensive stocks drawn from 10 different sectors and distinctly analysed over two data samples—pre- and post-Covid periods. We construct a predictive panel data model that simultaneously accounts for both heterogeneity and common correlated effects and also complementarily determine the predictive power of accounting for uncertainties in the valuation of U.S. stocks. We find that hedging effectiveness is driven by the types of stocks and measures of uncertainty. Defensive stocks provide a good hedge for pandemic-induced uncertainty, and the hedging effectiveness is higher during calm market conditions as compared to turbulent conditions, while both categories lack hedging capability in the face of equity-induced uncertainty. Finally, we find that the inclusion of uncertainty in the predictive model of U.S. stock returns improves its forecasts and this conclusion is robust to alternative measures of uncertainty and multiple forecast horizons. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Covid-19; defensive stocks; forecast evaluation; non-defensive stocks; pandemics; panel data; U.S. stocks; uncertainty,United States; COVID-19; financial market; forecasting method; health risk; pandemic; panel data; uncertainty analysis

Both growth accounting and econometric approaches are combined to estimate input terms (explanatory variables) parameters in the first step followed by the second step that plugs the estimated coefficients into the modified model to calculate the productivity indicators. The results show that the FDI inflows spillover effects are input-driven which was generally more predominant than total factor productivity (TFP) per worker (intensity) growth that is expressed the combined contribution of inputs' qualities technological progress or what so-called productivity-driven. TFP intensity growth results show that most of the selected Asian-Pacific counters economic growth is considered to be an input-driven and highly dependent on absorptive capacity per worker. This indicates that the FDI spillover effects (absorptive capacity) have a significant and low impact on these economies.

Our survey indicates that public embrace of cryptocurrencies continues to lag as the masses currently show reluctance in embracing cryptocurrencies as a complement, let alone a substitute to fiat counterparts. Governments have also successfully defended their sovereignty in preserving legal tender status, structural seigniorage and exclusivity. Market-based studies hint at consistent inefficiencies across the spectrum. Furthermore, whether fundamental and mining factors determine cryptocurrencies' values remain unsettled. The most promising areas of research for crypto-financial intelligentsia would be delving into establishing trial runs for central bank-backed cryptocurrencies.

This question is salient as there is a latent belief that both can actually produce hardships for people, making them to be economically deprived and aggrieved, thereby reducing their opportunity costs of rebellion against the incumbent government. This study answers the above raised question using a negative binomial regression on 38 African economies over the period 1980–2012, in which the following findings are established. Inflation volatility and not inflation per se constitutes a significant predictor of terrorism, particularly, for the domestic terrorist activity over the period of coverage. The prevailing impacts of other confounding variables such as surface areas, ethnicity, physical integrity rights, as well as the lagged value of terrorism are consistently notable across the model specifications. Thus, the paper argues that the non-statistical significance of inflation does not render it less important as it offers the enabling condition that makes inflation volatility to thrive. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Africa; inflation; inflation volatility; negative binomial regression; terrorism,Africa; decision making; ethnicity; inflation; local government; questionnaire survey; regression analysis; terrorism
The mitigating effect of governance quality on the finance-renewable energy-growth nexus: Some international evidence,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099044649&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2423&partnerID=40&md5=6e217f195fcb3a465557b496fad7b19e,"This study analyses the conditional effect of governance quality on the finance-renewable energy-growth nexus in 123 countries from 1990 to 2017. We built composite indexes of financial development and governance quality through the principal component analysis (PCA) using several financial variables and governance indicators. We employed the generalized method of moments (GMM) and the two-stage least squares (2SLS) techniques, but also the Granger non-causality in Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012). First, the disaggregated analysis shows that renewable energy consumption, financial inclusion, financial efficiency, and financial stability have positive marginal effects on economic growth under a good governance quality, except for financial depth. Second, the aggregated analysis confirms the positive marginal impact of financial development on growth only in low-income economies, whereas renewable energy consumption has positive marginal effects only in lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income economies. Finally, the results of the causality analysis differ among countries. Overall, governance quality has a threshold effect on the finance-renewable energy-growth nexus, which varies across countries. Accordingly, our study suggests more improvements in the governance quality in these countries, especially in the low-income and high-income countries, to enhance the marginal impacts of financial development and renewable energy consumption on growth. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",economic growth; financial development; governance quality; principal component analysis; renewable energy consumption,alternative energy; economic growth; governance approach; low income population; mitigation; numerical model; principal component analysis

Specifically, we apply the threshold quantile autoregressive model with exogenous variables and GARCH specification to model the realized kernel series of the Nikkei 225 stock market. Using this model, we investigate the relationship between the realized kernel series and its lagged one autoregressive effect, intraday returns, and abnormal trading volume. Applying an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme, our results confirm the existence of volatility clustering, a leverage effect, and a negative and asymmetric impact of trading volume on market volatility. We discover that the asymmetric characteristic of the news impact curve of the stock market varies over different quantile levels.

We review and analyse the uses of reserve requirements as a prudential tool and as a monetary policy instrument.

We attempt to address this puzzle and explore the impact of efficient utilization of debt on the linkage between R&D intensity and technology investment. Patent count data are used to measure enterprise innovation, therefore, negative binomial and Poisson regression is applied for empirical analysis. The estimations validate that the linkage between debt financing and corporate innovation is inverted U-shaped which approves the Kuznets curve hypothesis. Technology firms tend to decline debt undertaking after achieving a specific level, it is assumed as an optimum debt point, higher in incremental and lower in radical innovation. The mediation role of debt financing in the linkage between R&D intensity and technology investment is negative. However, efficient debt undertaking which remains under the optimum level improves the association between R&D intensity and enterprise innovation. High-tech firms should be cautious on external financing because abundant debt undertaking worsens a smooth innovative environment. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",debt financing; innovation; Kuznets curve; R&D intensity; technology investment,China; debt; finance; industrial technology; innovation; investment; Kuznets curve; research and development
The impact of exchange rate and exchange rate volatility on Mauritius foreign direct investment: A sector-wise analysis,2023,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098087887&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2416&partnerID=40&md5=22edac6b8b9f12ce7c0efb0cec8c4a7c,"This article analyses the structure of FDI inflow in different sectors of the Mauritian economy. While undertaking this investigation, we primarily allow interaction of FDI with exchange rate and exchange rate volatility and with other equally important macroeconomic variables such as trade openness, human capital, GDP, wages and salaries, gross capital formation, and inclusion of a dummy variable to assess the Mauritian Corporate Income Tax (CIT) reform of 2007. Sectors classified as manufacturing, financial, construction, real estate, tourism, and telecommunication, are considered. Using semi-annual data spanning from 1990 to 2015, the cointegration bound test reveals a systematic long-run relationship between the set of variables. This justifies the use of an ARDL model. While exchange rate and exchange rate volatility have negligible impact on FDI inflow in the short run, the ARDL results show that a real depreciation of the Mauritian Rupee against the U.S. dollar over the last decades has been beneficial as it has consistently enhanced FDI inflow in various sectors. Besides, there is evidence that investors in the construction, real estate, and telecommunication sectors, as compared to the financial and manufacturing sectors, are more affected by exchange rate volatility. The ARDL model also suggests that investors are particularly concerned with infrastructure capital, trading opportunity, and human capital, mostly when it comes to labour-intensive industries such as manufacturing, construction, and tourism. Additionally, the significance of the FDI lag values in the restricted error correction model (ECM) confirms the presence of short-run dynamism in FDI inflow modelling. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",exchange rate; exchange rate volatility; FDI; Mauritius; sector-wise,United States; exchange rate; foreign direct investment; Gross Domestic Product; human capital; inflow; macroeconomics; manufacturing

For that purpose, an equilibrating ripple effect is differentiated from a disturbing information cascade effect. Evidence suggests that a modest slow-moving equilibrating force originated from Hong Kong has flowed across all tier-one and most tier-two cities in the mainland, indicating a narrowing of regional inequalities between Hong Kong and the mainland cities. On the other hand, a powerful disturbing force emanated from Beijing has affected all other cities, widening the inequality gap in between. The impulse response functions further suggest that this disturbing force has a permanent impact on regional disparity. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",city house price; economic geography; information cascade effect; regional disparity; ripple effect,China; Hong Kong; consumption behavior; housing market; housing provision; national economy; regional development

The findings based on the ARDL model indicate that, in the long-run, foreign direct investment (FDI), trade balance and industrial production index (IPI) significantly affect emerging stock indices. In addition, the findings based on the QARDL model indicate that the short-run effect of FDI, consumer price index, interest rate and exchange rate varies across bullish, bearish and normal states of the emerging stock markets, whereas the long-run effect varies for all macroeconomic variables except IPI. These findings indicate that the results change when QARDL model is used; however, these findings remain same across seven emerging stock indices.

This study argues that the effect of government intervention on acquisition returns is partly dependent on institutional factors such as provincial marketization and the legal environment. This study employs ownership and merger and acquisition regulations issued by the Chinese government 2003–2018 to measure government intervention and also employs both the OLS and the random effects technique. The result shows a positive relationship between ownership intervention and acquisition returns. Next, the study finds that variances in regional marketization and the legal environment strengthen this relationship such that acquirers in high marketization regions and acquirers in a robust legal environment earn higher returns than acquirers in a low marketization region and acquirers in a weaker legal environment. The results imply that acquisition returns are not even across all locations in a transitional economy. Ongoing policies should aim at bridging the variances in different locations as it impacts acquirers' returns. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",China; grabbing hand or helping hand; legal environment; marketization; merger and acquisition (M&A); transitional economy,China; governance approach; ideology; merger; ownership; political economy; regulatory approach; regulatory framework; transitional economy

Hurwicz mechanisms are used to rigorously study the processes within which real and financial innovations are adopted into routine agents' activities. Mechanisms that could result in the existence of equilibrium in the economy with financial markets and private ownership are specifically under our consideration.

We construct the extended GARCH-MIDAS models to assess the forecasting ability of these indices and then compare them with four commonly used oil volatility drivers: oil supply, oil demand, oil speculation and interest rate. Firstly, the in-sample analysis suggests that all uncertainty indices and traditional determinants have significant impacts on oil volatility. Secondly, the out-of-sample evaluations suggest that US MPU, EMV and EPU indices are more powerful than other predictors to improve the forecasting accuracy of crude oil volatility, and US EMV exhibits the best prediction ability. Then, we find that EPU and MPU indices are more effective in forecasting high volatility in crude oil market, while traditional determinants together with US EMV index are more helpful in predicting low oil volatility. Finally, the forecasts of bad oil volatility can be improved by all predictors except for GEPU index, while the forecasts of good oil volatility can only be enhanced by US MPU, EMV and EPU. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Crude oil market volatility; GARCH-MIDAS; uncertainty indices; volatility forecasting,crude oil; energy market; forecasting method; geopolitics; monetary policy; uncertainty analysis

Gaps in previous research are addressed by using disaggregated firm-level data to construct trade-weighted firm-specific effective exchange indices and by applying copula theory. Our findings are as follows. First, extreme events leading to non-normality of stock returns are, at least partially, caused by a firm's international trade status. Second, Dutch listed firms experience stronger exchange rate exposure since they engage more into trade outside the Eurozone than the Belgian listed firms. Third, listed importing firms experience stronger exchange rate exposure than listed exporting firms, which indicates a dual effect of exchange rate risk arising from cash flow effects in both the domestic economy and the foreign market. Overall, our proposed methodology contributes to a better understanding of the link between exchange rate changes and trade, and may therefore be of use to policy makers involved with exchange rate or monetary policy. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Belgium; copula; exchange rate exposure; firm-specific trade-weighted exchange rate; Netherlands,Belgium; Netherlands; exchange rate; firm size; international trade; monetary policy

Using multi-scale wavelet decomposition, asset returns are decomposed into three timescales (short-, medium- and long-term), and a three-step filtered framework is used to explore dynamic non-linear linkages. We document significant bidirectional causal relationship between ESG, conventional and ethical equity portfolio returns. While the causality persists from the short- to medium-term, it is relatively weaker in the long-term. We further observe statistically significant causality running from ESG portfolio returns to currency and commodity returns. This causality is strongest in the short-term, turns weaker in the medium-term and, in some instances, disappears in the long-term. These results are generally robust for the use of original returns and VAR-filtered returns. However, as we control for conditional heteroskedasticity in the return series, the causality appears weaker particularly between ESG portfolio and commodity returns.

Government and private sectors' electronic transfer practices and financial inclusion in the economic community of the West African States,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097274136&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2357&partnerID=40&md5=2b3dcb5e9e27e9fd5a3e7213b4c51c9a,"Relying on a pooled-cross-sectional panel of the 2014 and 2017 Global Findex data, and a random utility theoretic model for revealed financial preferences data analysis, this paper examines the impact of government and private sectors' electronic transfer practices on financial inclusion, in terms of individuals' ability to save and borrow within the Economic Community of the West African States (ECOWAS). For sensitivity analysis, we adopt a sequential empirical strategy, in which we estimate and contrast four specifications of the saving and borrowing processes. Overall, our findings are stable across all specifications and show that along with socio-economic factors such as age and income, public welfare transfers and employment-based salary transfers foster financial inclusion by significantly raising individuals' marginal propensity to save (MPS) (by 11.6% and 12.9% respectively) and marginal propensity to borrow (MPB) (by 12.6% and 8.2% respectively) within ECOWAS. We found however that, within ECOWAS, both MPS and MPB have decreased by 21.4% and 7.2%, respectively, between 2014 and 2017. Therefore, in addition to other economic growth promoting fiscal tools in national governments' toolkits, mandates on public (governments to citizens) and private (Business to citizens) electronic financial transfers are significant policy leverages for improving financial inclusion and growth within ECOWAS. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",borrowing; economic growth; ECOWAS; electronic government; financial inclusion; saving,West Africa; economic development; financial market; financial provision; financial services; governance approach; public sector
Assessing the effectiveness of the emergency liquidity assistance tool in the euro area,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096882046&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2363&partnerID=40&md5=58d667c8b8efefc228e5cad5fc5bbbfb,"We examine the role and the efficiency of the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) tool in the Euro area which has been used to confront the contagion in the banking sector and the illiquid financial market conditions. We study four European countries (Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, and Ireland), which have received substantial ELA since the 2008 financial crisis. Through Bayesian VAR models, we seek to determine the effectiveness of national central bank lending, which includes the amount of ELA received by the domestic banking sector, an assessment of the direct effect of ELA on banks' liquidity and lending through deposits thus allowing banks to supply loans. In general, we find that the ELA tool was very effective in alleviating financial strains in these countries' central banks. For the Greek case, in particular, our findings indicate that the ELA was influenced not only from any changes in bank deposits but also from changes in the spread between the 10–year Greek and German government bond yields. Finally, the volume of non-performing loans in Greek banks was declining to capital injections to banks as their capital base was continually being restored through the ELA mechanism. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,Belgium; Cyprus; Greece; Ireland; assessment method; banking; capital; financial crisis; financial market; lending behavior
Managerial overconfidence and bank loan covenant usage,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097558769&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2388&partnerID=40&md5=b33ae1f188daba6c631b044c216af264,"This paper examines how managerial overconfidence affects loan covenant usage. We find that creditors significantly use more covenants; increase covenant intensity; use financial (but not general) covenants; use performance-based and capital-based covenants and rely on different types of covenants such as debt to cash flow, coverage ratio, net worth, debt to balance sheet and liquidity covenants to curb the default risk emanating from managerial overconfidence. Besides, creditors tighten individual covenants such as debt to cash flow covenant and current ratio covenant in order to alleviate their risk exposure. Covenants that serve to allocate the control rights ex-post are found to be important in controlling overconfidence risk. Covenant usage is reported to be quantitatively larger in the loan contracts of firms with higher market-to-book ratios, reflecting that high growth firms provide the opportunities for overconfident CEOs to invest more intensively. To address endogeneity, we use propensity score matching to mitigate potential endogeneity problem. In addition, we employ the SA Index and WW Index to control for firms' financial constraint. The effects of overconfident CEOs to loan covenant remain significant regardless of the firms' financial conditions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bank loan; covenant; credit risk; option price; overconfidence,banking; capital; credit provision; industrial performance; price dynamics; risk assessment
Determinants of stock market returns in emerging markets: The linkage between institutional quality and macro liquidity,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097494578&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2382&partnerID=40&md5=e188697a83a43cb6d8d8d610094e77e5,"This article identifies that the institutional framework of a country and its liquidity are the main key drivers of stock market returns. To study this, we used the worldwide governance indicators as proxies to measure institutional quality. We apply the Sys-GMM to model the correlational relationship of our variables. Our analysis for both institutional quality and macro liquidity in this study differs from the mainstream literature. In this paper, we modelled the stock market returns by adding the quality of a country's institutional framework and the country's liquidity level (measured by M2 account of money supply) to redefine classical models found in the mainstream literature. Sys-GMM is applied for a panel of 34 emerging countries between 2002 and 2013. We observed an excess of liquidity for the country's level positively affects stock market returns in these countries. This positive influence is actually enhanced through the development of an adequate institutional framework. In this context, a high national liquidity volatility, as it is often observed in emerging countries, is not necessarily a bad thing for the financial markets and their influence can actually be enhanced through an adequate institutional structure to promote long-term wealth for the society's well-being and not only the wealth resulting from temporary capital market returns. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",emerging markets; institutions; macro liquidity; stock return,financial market; governance approach; institutional framework; panel data; stock market
Trade credit and firm profitability: Empirical evidence from India,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096899382&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2352&partnerID=40&md5=27674919496fc65ff30ca99999858703,"We investigate the association between trade credit and firm profitability among large, Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) listed Indian corporations, identify an optimal trade credit level, and analyse how financial constraints influence the relation between trade credit and firm profitability. We use a sample of six broad non-financial sectors, constituting over 60 industrial sub-sectors, presented in panel form, and apply regression analysis to examine the relationship between trade credit and firm profitability. The findings suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship between trade credit and firm profitability and support an optimal receivables and payables level. Trade credit is profitable for firms until the associated benefits exceed the costs. Breaching the optimal level affects firm profitability. The extent of the financial constraints influences the optimal level of trade credit. Knowing the relation between trade credit and firm profitability may induce managers to form proactive trade credit management policies and help investors assess firm profitability and operational risk.

Estimating price impact via deep reinforcement learning,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096988150&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2353&partnerID=40&md5=b6fe22128984083ad10699df763461b3,"Price impact is the adverse change of the asset price against trader's action. As a crucial part of the indirect trading cost, price impact has attracted increasing attention in both econometric and data science literature. In this paper, we draw upon both strands of the literature and develop a deep neural network enhanced recursive (DeRecv) model to estimate temporary and permanent price impact of an order or trade. The temporary price impact is calculated as the sum of the expected immediate impact at each time point after taking action in an ad hoc market condition. The permanent price impact is defined as a new permanent level at which the information of the incoming order is entirely absorbed by the market. Through the experimental evaluation based on data from 10 stocks at NASDAQ and Shanghai Stock Exchange, we show that the proposed DeRecv model is better than the reinforcement learning model and the traditional vector autoregressive model. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",deep neural network; finance; price impact; reinforcement learning,artificial neural network; experimental study; price determination; stock market; vector autoregression
Does crude oil futures price really help to predict spot oil price? New evidence from density forecasting,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096678705&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2345&partnerID=40&md5=2b899b2833be602d3075f74840d54213,"In this paper, we detect the contributions of various predictors in terms of density forecasts of monthly West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices. In the first step, we use a simple predictive regression of crude oil prices on different predictors one-by-one as explanatory variables, and then two kinds of criteria, Log Score and Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), are employed to evaluate the density forecasting accuracy of them. In the second step, we utilize a CRPS-weighted combination and an equal-weighted combination, respectively, to assemble various density forecasting results in the first step. Finally, a novel test proposed by Rossi and Sekhposyan (2019) is adopted to verify the correct calibration of predictive densities by these two combination methods as well as an AR benchmark model. The empirical results indicate that those predictors proved to perform well (poor) in point forecasts of crude oil price in extant literature do not necessarily offer high (low) density forecasting accuracy. Interestingly, WTI oil futures price is the only predictor that can produce good out-of-sample density forecasts across various time horizons. In addition, we find that the two model combination methods can beat the AR benchmark in density forecasting of crude oil price. However, no model can produce correct calibration of predictive densities for crude oil price at time horizons longer than about 5 years. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Cramér-von Mises test; crude oil price; Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; predictive density; probability integral transform,Texas; United States; crude oil; energy market; forecasting method; oil supply; prediction; statistical analysis

Microstructure theory shows that participants increase bid-ask spreads in response to macroeconomic news to account for asymmetric information and inventory costs. However, the role of perceptions or biases of the market participants in influencing the bid-ask spread has been largely overlooked. This paper incorporates the role of ‘Recurrence bias’ in influencing trading decisions and therefore market volatility. Empirically, the model is tested using high-frequency exchange rate data and time-stamped news data on Indian rupee, which has seen sharp volatility in the period under study. Logit and GARCH analysis shows that volatility is positively linked to ‘Recurrence Bias’, which arises from the ‘availability of mental models’ to traders, created by past response of exchange rate to unexpected component of news. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",behavioural finance; exchange rate volatility; heuristics; unexpected and expected news,India; empirical analysis; exchange rate; financial market; heuristics; logit analysis; mass media
Modelling sustainability efficiency in banking,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096871668&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2349&partnerID=40&md5=53cd27849e628884b95fac5e3ce7bd1b,"We significantly contribute to the empirical literature by investigating sustainability efficiency in the banking industry and decompose it into internal sustainability and external sustainability in an explicit manner. We fill in the gap of the literature by considering internal sustainability from two perspectives which are banking stability and economic performance. We also extend the current studies by including both banks' social contributions (contributions to the society and the company development) and environmental responsibility to the estimation of external sustainability. Finally, we fill in the gap of the literature by estimating the determinants of bank sustainability efficiency. The findings from the output distance function and the panel vector autoregressive model show that the sustainability efficiency level in the Chinese banking industry (2007–2017) ranges from 0.45 to 0.75 (maximum sustainability efficiency score is 1 and minimum sustainability efficiency score is 0). There is a larger difference in terms of external sustainability efficiency in the sample, while stability is still one of the most serious issues, as reflected by the low stability efficiency score compared to other efficiency concepts. The results also show that internal sustainability efficiency is significantly affected by the firm specific determinants, business environment determinants and economic environment determinants. © 2020 The Authors.

Similarly, the long-run estimates from the quantile regression models and non-parametric approach indicate that the financial development indicators, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, inflation and trade openness have significant positive impact on income inequality in Australia.

Using individual data for 10 MENA stock markets, we found a positive unidirectional causal relation from market return to trading volume in most markets, indicating that overconfident investors attribute past market gains to their own talent in selecting securities and trade later as if they had generated these gains. Consistent with the hypothesis of the investors' overreaction to private information, we found that the trading activity becomes more excessive as the level of private information increases. Moreover, the overconfidence helps explain the observed excessive volatility in presence of high level of private information. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",overconfidence; price nonsynchronicity; private information; trading volume; volatility,Middle East; North Africa; empirical analysis; literature review; price dynamics; stock market; trade performance

All the six crypto markets exhibit a time-varying efficiency throughout the studied period, thus indicating a varying degree of exploitable profitable trading opportunities. The inefficiency ratio indicates that Bitcoin is the third most inefficient market, while the first and second most inefficient markets are DASH and NEM, respectively, thus they provide the most abnormal profit opportunities.

The empirical work uses data from 31 regions in China from the first quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2018 as observations. The outcome shows that, if the aggregate social financing increment reaches full efficiency, the rate of output growth could provide a chance to stabilize in the short term up to around 10%, while the surging leverage and debt ratio could become moderate. There should also be an opportunity to eliminate the threat of financial risks in the medium term if combined with the deployment and implementation of ongoing supporting measures. This paper recommends a three-step strategy of promoting efficiency, easing the risks and optimizing the structure.

Despite agriculture's diminishing role as a share of overall gross domestic product (GDP) in India, it plays a crucial role by providing a large proportion of jobs to the workforce. Acknowledging the central role of agriculture in the economy as well as the diversity between the states in terms of availability of resources, this study analyses the impact of various inputs like land area, fertilizers, electricity and labour use on the production efficiency of food grains at the state level from 2006 to 2017 using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI). The results highlight the variation in the performance of states with five out of selected 20 states experiencing efficiency under the CCR model of DEA and nine out of 20 states being efficient under the BCC model of DEA. MPI results indicate that 11 out of 20 states have progressed in terms of MPI during the period under consideration.

Using firm-level data from Turkey, changes in monthly crude oil prices per barrel of oil is, respectively, added to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), three-factor (3F) model and five-factor (5F) model and tested against the returns of portfolios constructed based on different firm-specific fundamentals. The results indicate that the oil price risk factor extracts significant coefficients in the cross-sectional regressions when conditioned against the returns even after controlling for the market and firm-specific risk factors. But, the asset pricing summary statistics used to evaluate the relative contribution of the oil price risk suggest that it cannot improve the relative performance of the base asset pricing equations to explain the average stock returns.

Our analysis spans the period 2003–2016. We identify three regimes corresponding to positive sensitivity, insensitivity and negative sensitivity and provide economic explanations of our findings. We find that negative sensitivity regimes mostly occurred during the financial crisis. Our research advances understanding of the financial economics that governs the interdependence of interest rate risk and credit risk. By reassessing interest rate risk management through the prism of the downside risk hedge, our results shed light on how financial institutions may better withstand adverse financial conditions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",emerging markets; endogenous regime detection; financial sector debt; interest rate sensitivity; Markov-switching,United States; debt; detection method; financial market; interest rate; sensitivity analysis
Detecting crisis vulnerability using yield spread interconnectedness,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089685915&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2191&partnerID=40&md5=5b636d9470e803db971c2bd015890c1d,"This paper explores the interconnections among foreign term spreads across different economies and their systemic implications on crisis vulnerability. The term spread, understood as the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates on Treasury securities, has a well-known predictive ability to forecast economic recessions in the short-run. An initial explanatory analysis evidences an increasing correlation between term spreads in the recent years and, in particular, the constitution of country clusters whose term structures share common latent factors. Moreover, these correlations seem to have augmented after the last international financial crisis. Further, the results from a probit model considering domestic term spreads, supply shocks on oil and energy prices, and an international term spread network structure reveal a statistically significant effect of term spread interconnectedness on future economic output. Following, this paper empirically shows how an increasing number of Granger-causality in-degree connections may be associated with a higher crisis vulnerability in the short-run. Additionally, a panel data regression corroborates the latter result to be robust under a wide range of conditions. Thus, an economy whose term spread is significantly caused in the Granger sense by external yield rates may be more prone to experience future recessions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",financial networks; Granger-causality; Interest rates; term structure,crisis management; economic instability; financial crisis; Granger causality test; interest rate; panel data; vulnerability

Using data from 2012 to 2018 across 165 economies across different continents, income levels and regulatory environments, we test a number of complex and related hypotheses. (a) We examine the effect of anti-money laundering regulations on financial sector development. (b) We examine if this effect differs across developing and developed economies. (c) We examine the nonlinearities in the anti-money laundering regulations-financial sector development nexus. We use the Prais-Winsten approach and the panel threshold estimation approaches to test our hypothesized relationships. We find evidence that anti-money laundering regulations generally promote financial sector development; however, this positive effect is concentrated in developing economies. We also find evidence of threshold effects of anti-money laundering regulations for our sample. Consistent with the earlier findings, the positive effect of anti-money laundering regulations on financial development is concentrated in countries below the threshold value of anti-money laundering regulations. These countries are mostly developing countries. Our findings suggest that strengthening anti-money laundering regulations will be beneficial to developing countries. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",anti-money laundering; financial sector development; money laundering; regulations; threshold analysis,developing world; financial market; financial system; regulatory framework
Leveraging random forest in micro-enterprises credit risk modelling for accuracy and interpretability,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096825826&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2346&partnerID=40&md5=a6f00b026bb61a3fb3aa7205c1d2722a,"This paper applies the Random Forest (RF) method for the robust modelling of credit default prediction. This technique has been proven as an efficient classifier and can provide better interpretability in comparison to other classifiers. Using Chines micro-enterprise credit data set, this study emphasizes the multidimensional analysis of credit risk, such as the whole sample, subsample, and the incremental effect of the group of predictors. To that end, relative variable importance (RVIs) has been presented for all predictors according to the contribution in the prediction accuracy so that to ensure interpretability of the model. The empirical findings confirm that RF technique is reliable and efficient across all of the criteria used in this study. In addition, the examined experimental analysis indicates that non-traditional variables have a significant effect on the classification accuracy. Thus, this paper recommends some alternative predictors like the legal representative's basic information, internal non-financial factors, along with traditional financial variables for sustainable model development. The performance is compared from the perspective of five different performance measures. This modelling algorithm can be used by different financial markets participants to measure systematically credit default prediction of individual and institutional customers. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",accuracy; high-dimensional data; interpretability; micro-enterprise; Random Forest; relative variable importance,accuracy assessment; comparative study; credit provision; experimental study; microenterprise; risk assessment

Furthermore, we reveal there exist significant long- and short-term risk spillovers and that the long-term spillover effects are generally lower than the short-term ones. Finally, we confirm that downside and upside risk spillovers are asymmetric. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",BRICS; oil; risk spillovers; stock markets,energy policy; oil supply; risk assessment; spillover effect; stock market

We focus upon differences across timescales since they represent heterogeneities of investors in markets. This study employs a wavelet approach to decompose return data into multiple timescales. Furthermore, we impose a same risk-aversion parameter constraint into all portfolios, which is proposed by Engle and Bali who show that the constraint provides a reasonable equity risk premium at a daily frequency. We observe positive relations between the expected returns on portfolios and the covariance of the market at a daily frequency, while these relations change as timescales increase. We find that a negative risk–return relation, which might be related to a correction process of overreaction at an approximately weekly frequency (2–16 days). The strongest positive relation is observed at an approximately monthly frequency (16–32 days). Monthly portfolio re-balances are widely used and might impact stock market return patterns. The equity risk premium in the longer frequency ranges from 8.64 to 11.10%. Our results are robust after controlling for macroeconomic variables, market implied volatility and test portfolios. Moreover, we investigate size and value factors and reveal that the risk premia disappear in the longer frequency, which suggests that ICAPM is satisfied. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",ICAPM; investment horizon; risk factor; risk-aversion; wavelet,capital market; investment; macroeconomics; price determination; pricing policy; risk factor; stock market

The results suggest that the effect of the latter's interest rate adjustment on China/U.S. exchange rate volatility is stronger than that of China's interest rate adjustment. Moreover, changes in the China/U.S. exchange rate have a slightly stronger effect on the U.S. interest rate than on China's interest rate. Our findings reveal that the interest rate parity theory does not hold for the entire sample period but may hold in subperiods.

Stock market development and nexus of market liquidity: The case of Fiji,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097130116&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2376&partnerID=40&md5=90106dd6f123f77ada37c2f16e98164e,"The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, to explore the macroeconomic and institutional factors influencing stock market development (SMD) in Fiji during the period 1996–2018 and second, to explore the causes of the prolonged sluggish nature of the South Pacific Stock Exchange (SPX) in Fiji. A mixed-method approach was employed: autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) testing framework was used to estimate the influence of the structural determinants in Fiji while descriptive and narrative analysis was used to explain the status of the SPX. The study findings partially confirmed the findings of previous studies. The findings that economic growth promotes SMD while inflation is negatively correlated to SMD were consistent with previous findings. However, the finding that regulatory quality and banking sector development have negative impacts on SMD was contrary to the findings of previous studies. Many determinants, which have been shown to have significant impact on SMD in other studies, did not show any significant impact on the SPX in the Fijian context, particularly the stock market liquidity showed no correlation to SMD and not distributed normally. Exploration of the nexus of the market liquidity reveals that present regulatory conditions are not conducive for the stock market to be vibrant and suggests eliminating excessive paperwork and entry restrictions are critical, not only to attract new players to the market but also to increase trading volumes. We argue that the concentration of ownership and market disintegration resulted in the current sluggish status of the SPX. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",determinants; Fiji; financial liberalisation; market integration; nexus of stock market liquidity; stock market development,Fiji; banking; economic growth; financial market; macroeconomics; stock market
Insider trading in the run-up to merger announcements.

The Financial Services Act 2012 was developed as a result in order to give more control and authority to the regulators of financial markets. Thus, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) succeeded the Financial Services Authority (FSA). An area requiring an improvement in regulation was insider trading. Our study examines the effectiveness of the FCA in its duty of regulating insider trading through utilising the event study methodology to assess abnormal returns in the run-up to the first announcement of mergers. Samples of abnormal returns are examined on periods, under regulation either by the FSA or by the FCA. Practically, stock price data on the London Stock Exchange from 2008 to 2012 and from 2015 to 2019 are investigated. The results from this study determine that abnormal returns are reduced after the implementation of the Financial Services Act 2012; prices are also found to be noisier in the period before the 2012 Act. Insignificant abnormal returns are found in the run-up to the first announcement of mergers in the 2015–2019 period. This concludes that the FCA is efficient in regulating insider trading. © 2020 The Authors.

Using two-step dynamic system generalized method of moments the study shows that while public sector-led financial sector transparency reduces bank market power, private sector-led financial sector transparency promotes bank market power given that private sector-led transparency gives financial cost advantage to financially sound banks to solidify the market power and dominance. Similarly, while financial crises reduce the market power of banks implying that during financial crises banks lose their market power, financial sector transparency promotes the negative effect of financial crises on bank market power. This implies that during financial crises, financial sector transparency whether enforced through private or public sector, boosts the weakening effect of financial crises on bank market power. These findings imply that regulators can rely on financial transparency to tame bank market power to enhance banking competitiveness. The findings and results are consistent even when country, time and continental effects are controlled for. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bank; financial sector transparency; market power; private sector; public sector,banking; financial crisis; financial provision; market conditions; private sector; public sector

While it is documented that an increased takeover likelihood increases the peer firm values, it is also possible that an increase in the expected shareholder gains, conditional on receiving an acquisition offer, affects the valuation of peer firms. In this paper, I document that peer firm abnormal returns during the announcement period are positively affected by the target firm announcement return and offer premium, which reflect target shareholder gains from the announced deal. Moreover, I find that target announcement returns are lower, on average, when the offer premium is lower than those of recent transactions in the industry. This paper highlights that investors reflect not only the increased takeover likelihood but also the revised expectations on the gains from a potential takeover bid in the valuation of peer firms. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",announcement returns; mergers and acquisitions; offer premium; peer firm valuation,financial market; financial services; firm size; merger; price dynamics; stock market
Threshold effects in the relationship between inflation and economic growth: Further empirical evidence from the developed and developing world,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096960607&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2368&partnerID=40&md5=1c04b1649bc8e183ef9451941b4e448d,"We re-evaluate empirically the threshold effect of inflation on economic growth for 27 countries (16 developing and 11 developed economies) over 1975–2018. Our research differs from the previous one in that it employs non-average inflation data with a balanced panel for a longer period of time. The methods of fixed effects and feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) are used to estimate the inflation threshold and its effects on growth. The empirical estimates show a significant negative association between inflation and growth above the threshold level of inflation. The empirical estimate indicates that inflation impede growth when inflation exceeds the turning point 12.23% and 5.36% in Panel-1 and Panel-2, respectively, and with the greatest negative effects in Panel-2. In addition, our findings provide evidence that gross fixed capital formation, government spending, household spending and real exports stimulate economic growth while the growth rate of the population is detrimental to the growth of the regions. Overall, the empirical result of this study could be of use in providing policy direction to governments and management authorities. In developing and developed economies, the management authorities need to cogitate a maximum rate of 12.3% and 5.4%, respectively, as an inflation target to avoid the detrimental effects of high inflation on economic growth for sustaining macroeconomic stability. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",growth; inflation rate; panel estimation,economic growth; empirical analysis; estimation method; financial market; financial services; inflation; macroeconomics; panel data

Then, we determined the significant predictors or leading indicators of currency crisis with logistic regression. Finally, we tried to measure and compare the in-sample and out-of-sample performances of our method with an index generated by principal component analysis (PCA). We found that the models using the currency crisis index generated by our method have higher in-sample and out-of-sample performances than the models using the currency crisis index generated by PCA. We concluded that the change in real exchange rate, bank loans over bank deposits, bank reserves over bank assets, growth in foreign reserves, growth in central bank foreign assets, M2 over foreign assets, change in exports, change in imports, industrial production index, M1 growth, M2 growth, foreign reserves over M1, central bank foreign assets over M1 and public sector credit growth are the leading indicators of currency crisis among 20 explanatory variables. As policy implications, we recommend that government and the monetary authority should strictly monitor the ratio of bank loans over bank deposits, public sector credit growth, the volatility of foreign trade, ratio of foreign reserves and central bank foreign assets over money supply among significant explanatory variables to avoid currency crisis as policy implications. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",dating currency crisis; EWSs; logistic regression; meta fuzzy functions; MPFIF,Turkey; capital flow; capital market; currency; early warning system; exchange rate; fuzzy mathematics; numerical model; principal component analysis; regression analysis

Wavelet analysis shows evidence of weak co-movement between stock returns (real and nominal) and inflation in the short run and strong co-movement between them in the long run. A movement towards the long run increases the strength of co-movement between the two variables. Analysis based on annual data and time domain indicates unidirectional causality running from nominal stock returns to inflation using both linear and nonlinear causality tests. However, causality between real stock returns and inflation vary depending on the tests employed. Time-scaled analysis shows that irrespective of the causality tests, a feedback relationship exists between stock returns (nominal and real) and inflation at the intermediate and long time scales. Results based on monthly data for time domain show bidirectional causality between stock returns (nominal and real) and inflation using both linear and nonlinear causality tests. Analysis by frequency bands reveals that, irrespective of the causality tests, stock returns (both nominal and real) have no link with inflation in the short to medium term. Some important policy implications are derived from the foregoing findings. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",hedging; inflation; nonlinear causality methods; stock returns; wavelet approach,United States; financial market; inflation; nonlinearity; stock market; wavelet analysis

Results indicated that strong and clear property rights protection, corruption freedom, fiscal and trade freedom, cause FDI inflows in Oman, whereas business freedom had no effects. It is crucial for policy makers in Oman to strengthen these institutional factors, craft and implement a policy framework to sustain their efficacy, while improving business freedom towards an open economic model. This also includes strengthening the legal framework, combating corruption and reducing subsidies and other forms of favouritism towards state-owned enterprises.

Existing empirical evidence suggests that countries are heterogeneous in their attitude towards innovation: Some countries rely more on technology adoption while other countries rely more on internal technology production. European countries that rely more on adoption are also typically characterized by lower fiscal policy flexibility and higher labour market rigidity. We develop a two-country model, in which both countries rely on R&D and adoption, to study the short- and long-run effects of aggregate technology and adoption probability shocks on economic growth in the presence of the aforementioned asymmetries. Our framework suggests that an increase in the ability to adopt technology from abroad stimulates future economic growth in the country that benefits from higher adoption rates but the beneficial effects also spread to the foreign country. Moreover, heterogeneity helps to explain the differences in macro quantities and equity returns observed in the international data. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",asset prices; asymmetric tax regimes; R&D investment; technology adoption,economic growth; fiscal policy; investment; labor market; macroeconomics; quantitative analysis; research and development; tax system; technology adoption; technology diffusion

Our findings are consistent with the view that the larger ownership combined with longer tenure of corporate insiders, while potentially entrenching insiders, extend the time horizon of these insiders so that they have stronger incentives to minimize the incidences of severe and serious corporate crimes, as reflected in insider arrests and indictments, that can substantially harm long-term firm value. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",cash flow right; controlling shareholder; corporate crime,Korea; corporate strategy; crime; governance approach; ownership; stock market

For this purpose, empirical tests are conducted using panel dataset of the fixed and random effects estimates form the period of 2007 to 2018. The results of fixed effects show ample evidence of significant impact from interest, profitability and credit supply to credit default when financial crisis in included in the panel data analysis. As result, interest and credit supply positively impact non-performing loans (NPLs) with statistical significance, while profitability has significant negative affiliation with NPLs. It also found that Palestinian commercial banks are able to cushion their NPLs during and after the global crisis. The novelty of this research provides a good knowledge in credit quality and risk control. Therefore, it can help in understanding the underlying causes of credit risk in this country and empower the commercial banks to sustain their competitive environment. Hence, it could be of considerable use to the monetary authorities to control credit default and protect Palestinian banks from financial distress. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",capital adequacy; credit default; interest; nonperforming loans; return on assets,Palestine; banking; capital; credit provision; estimation method; financial crisis; financial market; interest rate; macroeconomics; panel data; profitability; risk assessment
Detecting capital flow surges in developing countries,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096746766&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2335&partnerID=40&md5=50850c6cb4184f4c1786065130117ec8,"This study investigates excessive movements in capital flows called surges or bonanzas. Contrary to the previous work that extensively uses ad-hoc measures and discretionary thresholds; we adopt a distinctive methodology to detect capital flow surges based on right-tailed unit root tests. Generalized supremum augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) proposed by Phillips et al. (2015) is successfully applied to identify asset price bubbles. Exploiting the technical and conceptual similarities in the formations of asset price bubbles and capital flow surges, we perform the GSADF procedure using quarterly net capital flows data from 43 developing countries. The advantages of this procedure are twofold: it can distinguish the behaviour of volatility and explosiveness and diagnose multiple surges in a series. We identified 727 individual surges, 130 different surge episodes, and 4 global capital flow waves over the periods of 1995–2017. Compared with the existing measures, the application of this surge-detection technique provides a useful tool as a data-driven method with no need for discretionary thresholds. We also investigate the factors triggering capital flow surges, employing the Fernandez-Val and Weidner (2016) bias-adjusted fixed effects probit model and find that domestic factors play a dominant role on the surge occurrences in developing countries. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",capital flow surges; developing countries; fixed effect probit model; GSADF procedure; right-tailed unit root tests,
Examining the relationship between unconventional monetary policy and exchange rate movements: Empirical evidence from United States quantitative easing,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096672761&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2330&partnerID=40&md5=31b41f1a236e5fb7bc8c5987a72a5503,"This study employs Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasctic (ARCH) models to examine the impact of the unconventional monetary policies implemented in the United States upon the exchange rate movement and volatility in the emerging and growth-leading economies (EAGLEs), which include Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines and Turkey. Two series of exchange rates, namely average exchange rate (AER) and end-of-period exchange rate (EER), are used with different sets of sample, EER covers 1990:01 to 2018:04 and AER spans over 1980:01 to 2018:04 period. The variance series of the ARCH model is used to measure the volatility of AER and EER. The best ARIMA model is estimated for AER and EER for each country, and the ARIMA model serves as the mean equation for the ARCH volatility measure. Unlike the previous studies, this paper focuses on the EAGLEs, employs exchange rate, and considers various ARCH alternatives in choosing the best model. The findings of the study reveal that India is the only country among the EAGLEs whose exchange rate movement is affected by the U.S. unconventional monetary policy. Another important point is the negative effect of QE policies on the volatility of both AER and EER across the EAGLEs countries. The implication is that QE policies tend to reduce the uncertainty in the foreign exchange of the EAGLEs countries. Hence the policy makers in the EAGLEs countries do not need to take any action whenever the United States pursues unconventional monetary policy. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","ARCH; ARIMA(p,d,q); EAGLEs; exchange rate; unconventional monetary policy",Brazil; India; Indonesia; Mexico [North America]; Philippines; Turkey; United States; capital flow; capital market; exchange rate; monetary policy; policy making; regression analysis
The financial requirements of tech startups over its lifecycle in Bangalore: An analysis of why and how do they differ?,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097000366&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2362&partnerID=40&md5=d017f908339d57399a607d28d65830dc,"It is widely recognized by researchers, practitioners and policy makers that for a tech startup adequate financial capital is an essential resource in order to emerge, survive and grow over its lifecycle. However, there is a lack of understanding on what are the various needs for financing, what factors drive these needs and how do they vary over a startup's lifecycle. This study makes a key contribution to the literature by investigating the financial requirements for a tech startup and their determinants based on primary data gathered from 93 tech startups in Bangalore. Our findings suggest that, out of the three major categories of financial requirements, namely, Human Capital (HC), Research Capital (RC) and Social Capital (SC), financial requirements for HC and SC vary with a startup's lifecycle stage while financial requirement to acquire RC does not. With these results, we assert that, while all the three resources are essential, RC is the most critical financial requirement for a tech startup as it assumes predominance throughout a tech startup's lifecycle and acts as oxygen for its growth and sustainable competitive advantage. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",human capital; lifecycle stages; nature of financial requirements; research capital; social capital; startup financing; tech-startups,Bengaluru; India; Karnataka; competitiveness; finance; human capital; life cycle analysis; social capital
Are cryptocurrencies connected to gold?

Cryptocurrencies are new category of assets that can reduce the risk of well-diversified portfolio including gold. The paper explores the connections between seven cryptocurrencies and gold at bear (bull) markets across time to uncover the hedging properties of cryptocurrencies for gold investors. Wavelet technique was used to decompose the daily return series of the assets into short-, medium- and long-term frequencies. Quantile regression (QR) and quantile-in-quantile regression (QQR) were applied on the decomposed series to establish the association between the assets over 19 quantiles (τ = 0.05 to 0.95). QR results show all cryptocurrencies as hedges for gold regardless of market regime in the medium to long-terms. QQR results depict inverse association at bear market but positive association at bull market across time suggesting hedging possibilities at bear markets. Our study provides precise information to investors, regulators and policy makers on risk mitigating strategies for extreme gold market fluctuations across time and market states. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",cryptocurrencies; gold; MODWT; quantile regression (QR); quantile-in-quantile regressions (QQR),financial crisis; financial market; financial policy; gold; investment; regression analysis; stock market
Delayed informed trades and opinion divergence: Evidence from earnings releases,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097604805&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2387&partnerID=40&md5=ab8513ae99932d201e9a4f74c0403758,"This study begins to verify whether delayed informed trades occur surrounding an earnings release. Next, we discover that post-event investor opinions tend to diverge when more informed trades are delayed after the earnings release. As additional empirical evidence indicates, investors are likely compelled to postpone their informed trades due to information complexity, stock illiquidity, and institutional competition. Finally, such a documented association between delayed informed trades and opinion divergence remains robust to the placebo test, endogeneity problem, and large-cap sample bias. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",delayed informed trades; information complexity; institutional competition; opinion divergence; stock illiquidity,competition (economics); complexity; international trade; investment; stock market

The empirical finding lends strong support to the global presence of informed herding. Moreover, the effect of informed herding remains significant despite using various robustness checks. Eventually, we discover that informed herding is likely to be driven by two macro-level institutional characteristics: corporate transparency and foreign accessibility. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",corporate transparency; cross-country study; foreign accessibility; informed herding,accessibility; corporate strategy; financial market; global economy; industrial investment; institutional framework; investment; market conditions

This study employs two-step generalized method of moment's technique to arrive at results. Results of study confirm that firms with more liquid stock tend to provide more trade credit to their customers and also reduce the use of expensive trade credit financing from suppliers. Further, we find that higher stock liquidity is associated with significantly longer receivable period and shorter payable period for firms facing high financial constraints and also for firms with high external financial dependence. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",financial constraints; financial dependence; India; panel data; stock liquidity; trade credit,India; credit provision; database; financial system; industrial investment; industrial performance; panel data; stock market; trade performance

Meanwhile, empirical evidence often reveals complex non-Gaussian characteristics in the state-dependent dynamics. We generalize the latent-factor-driven endogenous regime-switching Gaussian model of Chang, et al., Journal of Econometrics, 2017, 196, 127–143 by allowing the state-dependent conditional distributions to be non-Gaussian. Our setup is more general and promises substantially broader relevance and applicability to empirical studies. We provide evidence to justify our generalization by a simulation study and a real data application. Our simulation results confirm that when the state-dependent dynamics are misspecified, the bias of model parameter estimates, the power of the likelihood ratio test against endogenous regime changes, and the quality of the extracted latent factor all deteriorate quite considerably. In addition, our application to the S&P 500 index return data reveals strong evidence in favour of our non-Gaussian assumption, and the superiority of our model specification delivers an important risk management implication. © 2020 The Authors.

Environmental disaster and women self-sustainability—A survey study on microfinance female clientele in Pakistan,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097008928&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2340&partnerID=40&md5=881f5881736690764ba172772e9986d4,"The prime objective of this study is to investigate the role of microfinance institutions towards women's self-sustainability in Pakistan because women are the most vulnerable community in Pakistan and in the world, too. Due to various issues like gender discrimination, women's self-sustainability is quite low, and this accounts for the negligible contribution of women in Pakistan's economy (up to 20 to 25%). In addressing this issue, the current study adopted a quantitative research approach and cross-sectional research design. By using a survey questionnaire, data were collected from female clients of microfinance institutions during May 1, 2018 to August 30, 2018. SmartPLS 3 was utilized to analyse the data. The results of the inquiry revealed that microfinance institutions have an essential role to play in promoting women's self-reliance. With the help of micro-enterprises for women, services offered by microfinance institution such as micro-credit, micro-savings, micro-insurance, micro-training and social capital have a major role in developing women's self-sustainability. However, an environmental disaster is one of the crucial factors, which limits the positive contribution of microfinance institutions towards women's self-sustainability. Our thorough research and knowledge on the subject indicates that the current study is the pioneer study that has investigated microfinance institutions as major facilitators of women's self-reliance but which has been limited by many factors such as environmental disasters. Hence, the current study appears salient for microfinance institutions, the government of Pakistan and other practitioners that desire to boost women's self-sustainability. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",An environmental disaster; gender mainstreaming; microfinance; women micro-enterprise success; women' self-sustainability,Pakistan; gender identity; gender role; microfinance; quantitative analysis; social capital; socioeconomic status; sustainability; vulnerability; womens status

Exploiting the heteroskedasticity in the stock market data, we identify shocks that originated in the respective domestic markets and shocks that are common to all markets. Our results underline the leading role of the United States in international equity markets, but also point to the importance of indirect spillovers for all economies. Variance decompositions show that while domestic shocks explain the bigger part of the variation in each stock market, a substantial part of the variation in the euro area and the emerging economies can be attributed to foreign shocks. A comparison with a sample covering the pre-crisis period from 1999 to 2007 suggests a strengthening of the linkages among global stock markets in recent years. In particular, the spillovers from advanced to emerging economies have become more pronounced. © 2020 The Authors.

Investigating the determinants of commercial bank interest rate spreads in Lesotho: Evidence from autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and non-linear ARDL approaches,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097661190&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2370&partnerID=40&md5=f34f9179be8d042c0ecd27c442faaa5d,"This article investigates the determinants of commercial bank interest rate spreads in Lesotho using monthly time series data from January 2009 to December 2018. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach is used to measure long-run co-integration while the non-linear ARDL (NARDL) model is used to test validity of long-run symmetric effects. The bounds tests revealed existence of long-run co-integration between the study variables. Inflation and the Treasury bill rate have a positive and statistically significant impact on interest margins while the deposit rate has a negative and significant effect. The pass-through of inflation and the deposit rate to interest margins is less than one, respectively. This confirms that inflation affects banks' lending rates with a second round effect while deposit liabilities are not the only source of credit financing for banks. The null hypothesis of long-run symmetry is rejected for Treasury bill rates. Authorities are advised to ensure price and general macroeconomic stability while also pursuing policies aimed at maximizing savings. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",asymmetry; co-integration; commercial banks; interest rate spreads; Lesotho,banking; credit provision; financial market; financial provision; financial services; inflation; interest rate; nonlinearity

We use hand-collected data for 80 listed Nigerian multinational corporations for the period 2011–2016 (480 firm-years) and apply a three-stage least squares regression to address endogeneity issues. Our findings show international exposure of EMMNCs motivate appointment of FIBCs and FCEOs who positively affect their CG quality. In addition, international board interlocks positively moderate the likelihood of FCEOs to export and enhance EMMNCs' CG quality, but negatively moderate FIBCs impact on CG practices of EMMNCs. Finally, we develop a framework to show how EMMNCs' CG practices are exemplary to local firms in the home country who may mimic these governance practices. We contend the repeated game of governance spill-over and mimetic isomorphism drives the evolution of CG institutions and, potentially, will generate institutional change in CG practices in emerging markets. © 2021 The Authors.

This type of modelling delivers better quantile forecasts at various forecasting horizons. The forecasting results not only imply that the risk measure of EPU measure is linked to the future evolution of the index itself, but also it help constructing explicitly EPU risk measures, which are used to identify what drives such risk policy measures, especially across certain sub-sample periods associated with major global events, such as the collapse of the Lehman Brothers, the Trump's election and the trade-war tensions between the United States and China. The findings offer a new empirical perspective to the existing EPU literature, documenting that special world events carry a strong informational content as being a primary key to understand the dynamics of the economic policy tails. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Economic policy uncertainty; QADL-MIDAS model; risk,United States; economic policy; empirical analysis; forecasting method; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis

First, we develop a theoretical model to obtain insights into the propagation of shocks through input–output linkages, which suggests that the network effect arises via sectoral downstream linkages. We then quantitatively assess this theoretical implication with United States manufacturing industries, where the aggregate technology shocks are derived from a dynamic factor model. We find that aggregate technology shocks lead to an increase in the output growth of the sector, both directly and indirectly via its intersectoral linkages. More interestingly, we document a crucial role of the intersectoral network channel, which contributes about 50% of the total effect. In addition, the network-based effect comes mostly from downstream linkages of sectors, which is broadly consistent with theory. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",aggregate technology shocks; business cycle; input–output linkages; intersectoral network; manufacturing industries; productivity; TFP,United States; business cycle; input-output analysis; manufacturing; productivity; quantitative analysis; technological development; theoretical study

Does operating leverage increase firm's profitability and bankruptcy risk? Evidence from China's entry into WTO,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097742365&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2395&partnerID=40&md5=e6b9c31a9455a87631d1297c8d42b3b1,"This study tests the relationship among operating leverage, profitability and financial leverage. Operating leverage boosts profitability and cuts down the optimal financial leverage of the firm. Therefore, operating leverage renders a negative relationship between profitability and financial leverage that is inconsistent with the static trade-off theory. By considering WTO and using data of export manufacturing firms in China for the period 1990–2018, our results indicate that operating leverage and profitability have a positive relationship, and operating leverage is a central cause to create an inverse correlation between profitability and financial leverage when firm's revenue declines. In addition, operating and financial leverages have substitutions effect when the firm operating cost is quasi-fixed. Furthermore, the firm's bankruptcy risk is linked with higher operating leverage. Our study suggests that firms should consider both operating and financial leverage to maximize their profitability because the preference of one leverage on the other increases bankruptcy risk, and operating leverage preference creates an inverse correlation between profitability and financial leverage. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bankruptcy risk; financial leverage; operating leverage; profitability; WTO,China; bankruptcy; industrial performance; profitability; risk assessment; World Trade Organization
Credit information sharing and non-performing loans: The moderating role of creditor rights protection,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097660504&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2398&partnerID=40&md5=86a52e579b8d2bc8e532e1598a65bc5f,"This study uses data from 132 countries to investigate the effect of credit information sharing on non-performing loans (NPLs) as well as whether the effect is sensitive to creditor rights protection. The results show that credit information sharing improves NPLs, while creditor rights protection worsens NPLs. Generally, we observe that in the presence of creditor rights protection, the positive impact of credit information sharing on NPLs is higher. We also observe that in the presence of credit information sharing, creditor rights protection reduces NPLs. We, therefore, argue that there is complementary effect of credit information sharing and creditor rights protection on NPLs in the study countries. Further analysis involving breaking the data into income groups shows that credit information sharing slows down NPLs in high income, upper-middle income and lower-middle income countries. It does not significantly impact NPLs in low-income countries. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",credit information sharing; creditor rights; moderation analysis; non-performing loans,credit provision; developing world; information management; legal rights; performance assessment

However, exchange rate has a significant positive impact on oil volatility. And short-run interest rate does not have a significant effect on oil price volatility in most cases. In addition, the responses of oil price volatility to all five macroeconomic fluctuations are significant.

The research analyses the differences between Catalan companies and the rest of the country and it is focused on the determinants of the variability of returns after the illegal independence referendum. Determinants such as firm country risk concentration, measured as the level of internationalization or the growth opportunities, and others like size or financial constraints. An additional event study examines the impact of the flight of companies from the region. The general approach used in this article is the event study methodology. The experiment is divided in two parts (geographical and firm level). The market model is used to describe the returns, abnormal returns are obtained in one step using dummy variables and all equations are estimated together through a seemingly unrelated regressions framework. Then cross-sectional regressions are employed to explain the abnormal returns' variance. Changes in sample, variables and volatility are also implemented. It demonstrates that larger and more internationalized firms were less exposed to this event, unlike those with higher growth opportunities and higher financial constraints. Lastly, the flight of companies served to mitigate the adverse effect. This research highlights investors' fear of drastic political changes and points out characteristics that make some securities a refuge in a unique case, as an attempt of unilateral independence. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Catalonia; event study; internationalization; political uncertainty; stock returns,Catalonia; Spain; experimental study; globalization; independence; political conflict; regression analysis; risk assessment; stock market; uncertainty analysis

We analysed the impact of turnovers of these local core officials upon the investment and financing of local private-sector enterprises. We found that when changes in provincial inner core officials happened normally, the long-term impact on the investment and financing of local private-sector enterprises was not so obvious. However, when senior officials were investigated for corruption, the investment and financing of enterprises dropped significantly. For enterprises with personal political capital only, the impact of local core official turnover upon firm financing was even more pronounced.

(2009) and Bali, Brown, and Demirtas (2013), which examine from the perspectives of asset weight of Inverse VIX and holding periods. We employ the refined definition of almost stochastic dominance by Chang, Liu, and Hung (2019) via its first- and second-order definitions. We also compare this asset's performance with S&P 500 and a 30-year T-bond. The empirical evidence indicates that the Inverse VIX is preferred over the other two investment alternatives. Our conclusions indicate that the holding period length plays a role. It is recommended to increase the asset weight of the Inverse VIX within its upper limit that is bound to enhance portfolio performance. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",almost stochastic dominance; inverse VIX,comparative study; empirical analysis; investment; performance assessment; stochasticity
Governance and financial development: Evidence from a global sample of 120 countries,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096773125&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2327&partnerID=40&md5=173762d4cc0b5728d91ac0b1d9ca43fc,"This study empirically investigates the impact of governance quality on financial development. The study employs a Dynamic Common Correlated Mean group technique using data from a global sample of 120 countries, among which 32 high- and 88 low-income countries, for the period 2002–2017 to examine this linkage. Political stability and absence of violence, rule of law, control of corruption, regulatory quality, government effectiveness, and voice and accountability are used as proxies for governance quality, whereas financial institutions depth and credit to private sector are proxies of financial development. The following findings have been established. Regulatory quality and political stability and absence of violence are positively associated with financial development, whereas voice and accountability, and government effectiveness are negatively associated with it. Moreover, the degree of the impact of these governance indicators on financial development is relatively greater in high-income countries as compared to low-income countries. On the basis of these results, governments in high- and low-income countries must implement the following policies in order to improve the development of their financial systems: Firstly, they should promote a better regulation quality by implementing sound policies and regulations that permit and improve private sector development. Secondly, they should maintain a stable political environment by allowing people to enjoy, but not excessively, their rights and freedoms under the constitution. Policy makers should lastly moderate their commitment towards certain public policies, such as imposition of high tax rate to the private sector. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",dynamic common correlated mean group; financial development; quality of country governance,capital market; corruption; financial crisis; financial system; governance approach; investment

Our results show that there exists a long-run cointegrating relationship between financial development and FDI in financial services after incorporating the extent of heterogeneity among emerging economies. We find long run unidirectional causality from financial development to financial services FDI. Using fully modified OLS (FMOLS) estimation, we estimate the long run elasticities between financial services FDI and financial development. Our results show that financial development has a positive and significant impact on FDI in financial services, which implies that a country with well-developed financial markets tend to attract larger amounts of FDI in financial services. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",emerging economies; FDI; financial development; services,cointegration analysis; developing world; error correction; financial market; financial services; financial system; foreign direct investment

The study evaluates this relationship in the third-sector, faith-based charity organizations (FCOs) context. Using a longitudinal sample of FCOs operating in a developing Muslim-majority country, this paper reports that CEO's educational background, that is, an MBA degree matters for financial inclusion. These findings demonstrate how CEO's educational background shape the strategic posture of third-sector organizations such as the FCOs. Additionally, the interaction effects further suggest that MBACEOs derive their imputes from robust sutural positions within the organization such as role duality, founder and internally hired CEO status.

Thus, based on the internationalization framework of Dunning (Multinational enterprises and the global economy, Addison-Wesley, 1993), this article aims to empirically investigate and compare the FDI determinants of the tourism industry in Oman and Egypt not only through the investors perceptive but more importantly through other stakeholders perspective such as experts in economy and tourism sector due to their vital role in decision making. It also examines the moderating role of investment environment on the relationship between the determinants and attractiveness of FDI. Further, PLS-SEM was employed for data analysis purposes. The results revealed that resource-seeking and efficiency-seeking have a significant role in both countries. However, though market-seeking was positive and significant in Egypt, it was found insignificant in Oman. Interestingly, the investment environment has a significant moderating role in both countries. The current study contributes to the literature by providing an obvious understanding of tourism FDI determinants with a special emphasis on the essential view of the related experts. It also presents a clear sight to tourism authorities on the essential factors that attract FDI in tourism. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",efficiency-seeking; FDI; investment environment; market-seeking; resources-seeking; tourism-FDI attractiveness,Egypt; Oman; financial market; financial services; foreign direct investment; investment; tourism management

In this paper, we examine whether CEO overconfidence could explain cross-sectional heterogeneity in the systemic risk of U.S. bank holding companies. Using measures of overconfidence based on CEOs' options exercise behaviour and language used in the Managerial Discussion and Analysis of the 10K-filings, we find that banks with overconfident CEOs have higher systemic risk than their counterparts with non-overconfident CEOs. Banks with overconfident CEOs also have higher holding of private mortgage-backed securities and higher leverage. During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, banks with overconfident CEOs experienced higher realized systemic risk. Our work shows that the behaviour of overconfident bank CEOs could impose negative externalities beyond individual bank boundary. © 2020 The Authors.

We also find that intrinsic motivations significantly mediate between financial advice and stock trading behaviour. Extrinsic motivations have significant mediation effects between sources of information and stock trading behaviour. Taken together, the results indicate that financial advice indirectly sparks stock trading through intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, whereas WOM communication performs the same function only through extrinsic motivations.

Based on a small-scale macroeconomic model, info-gap theory is used to rank different monetary policy strategies in terms of their robustness against this uncertainty. Applied to the euro area, we find that an inert or patient monetary strategy is more robust to natural rate uncertainty than a strategy that follows an estimated Taylor rule. An actively responsive monetary strategy is least robust.

We find that BH reputation proxied by the past II rankings has no significant impact on the recommendation performance, suggesting that the II rankings are largely “popularity contests”. However, BH reputation proxied by the past year recommendation performance of BHs has a significantly positive impact on the recommendation performance in the next year, implying that the recommendation performance of BHs in the UK market is persistent.

Therefore, this study investigates the impact of corporate tax reduction, terrorism, energy shortfall, availability of labor, infrastructure and degree of business openness on the FDI in Pakistan. Further, it compares democratic and autocratic regimes to evaluate their impact on attracting FDI in Pakistan. A vector error correction (VEC) model is used on the secondary data of the period 1989–2016. The results of the study show that corporate tax rate, terrorism, and energy shortfall have significant negative impact on FDI.

First, NIM is significantly influenced by the different institutional designs of capital-based (the UK and the US) and bank-based financial markets (continental Europe). Second, there are differences in NIM caused by bank size.

The results reveal that a dynamic adjustment in economic growth in the MENA region occurred from the short to the long run. Arguably, government expenditures can promote economic growth. In the long run, the coefficients of government expenditures are positive and significant in oil and non-oil countries; in the short run, the coefficient is statistically significant in oil countries but not in non-oil countries. The coefficients of government expenditures markedly differ between the two groups. For the MENA region, as a whole, government expenditures exhibit a crowding-in effect instead of a crowding-out effect on growth. Importantly, to sustain economic growth, non-oil countries must embark fiscal reform measures promptly by optimizing government expenditures. Oil countries should consider the implications of short- and medium-term fiscal imbalances. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",economic growth; government expenditures; MENA region; pooled mean group,Middle East; North Africa; dynamic analysis; economic development; economic growth; estimation method; fiscal policy; governance approach; heterogeneity; panel data; public spending

To this end, the fixed effect models are adopted using 28 country-level panel incorporating countries that have experienced dollarization from 1995 to 2016. The overall estimation results show that first, high inflation, less flexible exchange rate movements, the sluggish real economy and the inadequacy of the institutional environments are contributing factors to intensify the dollarization. Secondly, the estimation results using the de-dollarization country group indicates that real appreciation of the domestic currency is an important factor in mitigating the degree of dollarization while the increasing effects of inflation on dollarization are more pronounced in the dollarized economies. Finally, high dollarization or a high depreciation rate of the domestic currency tends to increase inflation, and those effects are found to have more significant in the dollarized economies, while real depreciation is a factor contributing to lowering inflation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",dollarization; foreign exchange; inflation,currency market; exchange rate; inflation

To explore whether these risks can be alleviated by fintech and study its specific mechanism from the perspective of managers, we investigate on a sample from the establishment of fintech subsidiaries in Chinese commercial banks during 2014–2018. The results show that fintech can alleviate pre-loan risk associated with credit activities, and this negative effect is more pronounced in banks with higher level of managerial ownership. As the control of post-loan risk is more dependent on the regulators, fintech in banks has no significant effect on reducing post-loan risk associated with credit activities.

Can black swans be tamed with a flexible mean-variance specification?,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094642281&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2317&partnerID=40&md5=ac999f3912990936b95cf317af1ab54c,"We examine the homogeneity of the highly improbable returns, what practitioners and the mainstream economic press also call black swan events. By setting up a simple framework and using the benchmark stock market indices of all OECD countries, we find that the frequency of black swans varies greatly over the last two decades often with dramatic changes that can be related to major economic events. Moreover, during the global financial crisis, black swans were substantially more frequent for most countries even after controlling for the level of volatility. This implies that, despite the plethora of appropriate financial instruments to counter this effect, during an obvious economic turmoil, stock markets are still more likely to experience highly improbable events. © 2020 The Authors.

This paper studies the conditions under which excess “losers” are generated during the process of liberalization with a focus on the role of institutions in economic transition. I contend that poor institutions, in particular property rights and democracy, can create unnecessary hardship in the transition to greater openness, generating a much higher burden on compensatory policies and making it more difficult to sustain open trade policies. Using a new dataset of trade openness, economic inequality, and institutions, and using 3SLS estimation to account for endogeneity, the analysis finds that this is indeed the case: high property rights and more democracy appear to help to mitigate trade-related inequality. Moreover, poor institutions create a downward spiral, with greater inequality leading to lower trade openness. These results imply that basic institutions can help to minimize losses sparked by globalization, while other well-meaning policies can actually increase disruptions. © 2020 The Author.

How does regulation affect the organizational form of foreign banks' presence in developing versus developed countries?,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092357531&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2278&partnerID=40&md5=45d421e33ffabc1cc08749ccbf1c7467,"Using a unique hand-collected dataset of 1,251 European Union banks and 20,850 foreign affiliates hosted in 154 countries, this paper investigates how both host country and home country regulations affect the decision on where and how to go abroad in developing countries as opposed to developed countries. We find that banks prefer high-income countries with numerous activity restrictions and weaker supervision but less developed countries with less restrictions and stronger supervision. In all cases, they avoid locations with stronger capital regulation than at home. Regarding the choice of foreign organizational form (branches versus subsidiaries), banks rather operate subsidiaries in both high and middle-income countries with stringent entry requirements but prefer branches in developing countries with stringent capital requirements and greater supervisory power. Our findings contribute to the literature examining bank internationalization and have several policy implications for regulatory reforms in developing and developed countries. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",bank regulation; cross-border entries; economic development; foreign branch; foreign subsidiary,Europe; banking; developing world; economic development; globalization; industrial regulation; multinational enterprise

First, a long–short-term-memory (LSTM) model is trained to learn the monthly closing prices of the stocks. Then these predictions are used in the calculation of portfolio weights. Five different portfolio construction strategies are introduced including modifications to smart-beta strategies. The suggested methods are compared to a number of baseline methods, using the stocks of BIST30 Turkey index. Our strategies yield a very high mean annualized return (25%) which is almost 50% higher than the baseline approaches. The mean Sharpe ratio of our strategies is 0.57, whereas the compared methods’ are 0.29 and −0.32.

Using the companies listed on the Shenzhen A-share Main Board from 2003 through 2017, we test the relationship between managerial ability and the quality of information disclosure. We further explore the internal mechanism by which managerial ability impacts on idiosyncratic volatility. The empirical results show that competent managers reduce idiosyncratic volatility by improving corporate transparency. In other words, corporate transparency plays an intermediary role. Competent managers disclose higher quality information. In turn, reputable management and high-quality company information attract more attention and information mining. This improves corporate transparency, which can reduce arbitrage space and alleviate the idiosyncratic volatility of the stock price. Our main findings survive a series of robustness tests including an alternative measure of managerial ability, the application of a 2SLS regression and so on. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Corporate transparency; idiosyncratic volatility; managerial ability; panel regression,China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; corporate strategy; data mining; empirical analysis; management practice; panel data; price dynamics; regression analysis; stock market
A developing country's commercial banking risk governance disclosures: Post-financial crisis,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096642254&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2320&partnerID=40&md5=bd94e18af9376b1688f3c7955c1cd622,"Risk governance disclosures (RGDs) provide users with valuable information and greater corporate insights about the management, oversight and strategic direction of the organisation. However, insufficient research has been conducted in this area. RGDs reduce information asymmetry and increase transparency. This study examines the level of RGDs in the commercial banks (CBs) of a developing country where most RGDs are voluntary and made at management's discretion. The study adopted a quantitative, multi-method approach. RGDs for two publicly listed CBs in Barbados were analysed over 10 years (2007–2016) using a risk governance disclosure index (RGDI). Correlations were also used to determine if a relationship existed between the disclosures and performance. Disclosures were found to be general and non-standardized. Company-specific disclosures were infrequent, and annual disclosures were repetitive and symbolic. No significant relationships were discovered between corporate governance disclosures and performance. However, but bank performance indicators were found to be positively related to risk disclosures. A limitation of the study is that only two of the six CBs reported in a manner suitable for this study. Hence, reducing the number of observations. This was overcome through the use of a longitudinal approach which allowed for improved understanding of RG reporting practices in this sector. The results provide valuable insights which supplement the existing literature. They also provide pertinent information for standard-setters, regulators and preparers of the reports. The study contributes to the existing literature in that it examines the disclosure behaviours of CBs in a non-traditional governance model in an economy with limited research. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",disclosures; institutional; legitimacy theory; qualitative; risk governance,banking; commercial activity; developing world; financial crisis; governance approach; institutional framework; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; research work; risk assessment
Debt stabilization and financial stability in a monetary union: Market versus authority-based preventive solutions,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092366917&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2288&partnerID=40&md5=0ec2fd2d3d3cd1b45f8c21fca5456304,"Is a debt-concerned monetary authority desirable? This article deals with the impact of fiscal-monetary policy interactions in a monetary union on country-specific and union-wide debt stabilization, when the authorities act strategically. The focus is on the impact that monetary policy would have on a debt-concerned fiscal authority through the debt constraint and the corresponding interaction with decentralized fiscal policies. It is shown that the fiscal-monetary (overall) policy coordination strategic regime delivers better results than the non-cooperative regime for both the output gap and the outstanding level of debt at the union level. Two further institutional arrangements are investigated and compared: An authority-based preventive procedure, which works through a debt-concerned monetary authority, and a market-based one, which works through financial markets by assuming a risk premium on country-specific nominal interest rates according to the country-specific fiscal stances. The risk premium acts as a form of ‘market-based’ discipline. Both regimes stand between the decentralized and the centralized setting. The central bank's optimal weight on union-wide debt stabilization is computed when financial markets provide discipline to the fiscal authorities. It is optimal for the social planner to appoint a debt-concerned central banker, if there is a degree of conservatism from the monetary authority, and/or if the social planner cares about union-wide debt stabilization. A higher risk premium parameter enhances the impact of the former on the optimal weight on union-wide debt stabilization, while it reduces the impact of the latter. © 2020 The Authors.

Using panel data for the period 2004–2013, our results indicate that the 2008–2009 crisis caused a negative shock to banking sector loan growth rates which was considerably higher during 2008 compared to 2009. Although loan supply decreased during the crisis, there were differences under different ownership types and between high and upper-middle income countries. Our findings suggest that consumer and retail loans declined significantly more in high income economies compared to upper-middle income countries. Further, in upper-middle income economies, the reduction in consumer and retail loans in 2009 was higher under foreign bank ownership in comparison to domestic-private bank ownership. Overall, the results indicate that the lending behavior of banks with different types of ownership is significantly different in upper middle income countries compared to high-income countries. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",bank ownership types; banks; financial crisis; lending,banking; comparative study; financial crisis; financial system; firm ownership; lending behavior; retailing; state owned enterprise

Most importantly, we derive the theoretical properties of the multivariate asymmetric power model and explore its finite-sample performance through a simulation experiment on the size and power properties of the diagnostic tests employed. Our empirical application shows that all three power transformed conditional variances are found to be significantly affected by the powers of squared returns, realized measure, and range-based volatility as well. We demonstrate that the augmentation of the HEAVY framework with the range-based volatility estimator, leverage and power effects improves remarkably its forecasting accuracy.

We filled this gap by investigating firms' collateralized borrowing in 131 countries between 2005–2017 using the World Bank Enterprise Surveys. Overall, 77% of loans require collateral, and the median loan-to-collateral value is 60%. While small firms and loans from non-bank financial institutions are less often associated with collateral, when collateral is pledged, the type of collateral assets is strongly correlated with the loan-to-value ratio. When more illiquid and indivisible assets such as land and buildings are pledged as collateral, higher collateral value is required. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",access to finance; collateralized borrowing; financing constraints,finance; lending behavior; survey; World Bank
Can sentiments on macroeconomic news explain stock returns?

However, do sentiments on macro-economic news explain stock returns? This article proposes a theoretical model to explain the relationship between stock returns and the market misperception which is driven by investors' sentiments. Then, microblogs regarding the macro-economy posted on Sina Weibo, a mainstream Chinese Social Network Site, are extracted to measure investors' macroeconomic sentiments (IMSs) through machine learning approaches. A preliminary event study suggests that IMSs capture the development of influential macroeconomic events. Empirical results demonstrate that orthogonalized IMSs including anger, disgust, fear, joy and sadness exert heterogeneously significant effects on the Shanghai Composite Index (SHCI), and no reverse effect is found. Thus, the IMS contains additional information related to the macro-economy; but cannot be explained by macroeconomic factors. IMSs improve the in- and out-of-sample predictabilities of SHCI returns. Thereby, investors' sentiment can be an important channel through which the macro-economy affects the stock market. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Macro-economy; predictability; sentiments; stock return; Weibo,China; Shanghai; capital flow; investment; machine learning; macroeconomics; social network; stock market; theoretical study

The available literature on wealth effects mostly focuses on advanced economies. Hence, this article studies the financial wealth effects on private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) in an emerging economy like India. We use the quarterly data for the period 1951-2015 and employ the ARDL method that has the flexibility in overcoming the econometric issues associated with the traditional methods in the analysis of time series models. The results suggest that financial assets wealth in the form of stock market capitalization (MC) significantly affects the PFCE. This article establishes the long-run positive relationship between financial wealth assets and household consumption. The major inference is that households are closely linked with the financial markets through their investments in the form of insurance, mutual funds, company deposits, company stocks, and other forms. Hence their consumption behavior is significantly affected by the financial wealth created by the financial markets. The policy implication is to make the financial markets more transparent, easy to access by reducing the related financial intermediation costs leading to a deeper integration of the households with the financial markets, which in turn would result in increased financial asset wealth generation and consequently increased household consumption to boost economic growth. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Consumption; economic growth; exchange rate; fiscal deficit; inflation; stock price; wealth effects,India; consumption behavior; economic growth; exchange rate; financial market; fiscal policy; household expenditure; inflation

This paper reviews literature on the negative impacts of the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU) on individuals, businesses, governments, and economies at the local and international levels. This reveals that a high EPU is associated with adverse effects on households, corporations, and governments, which tend to delay many financial decisions under high uncertainty, which leads to lower consumption, fewer issuances of debt, fewer investments, and higher unemployment. The effects of political and regulatory uncertainty also extend to the commodity markets, such as the adverse effects on both oil and gasoline markets, and can potentially create adverse impacts on the crypto-currency market and its potential growth. We demonstrate that governmental uncertainty also affects financial, housing, and equity markets; debt issuances; and the entire economy. This underscores the importance of considering EPU as a risk factor. The association with several components of the global economy reflects not only the EPU index's critical influence, but also the importance of risk management. Our results lead us to consider the gravity of economic policy uncertainty and call for innovation across different sectors to mitigate its adverse effects. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Capital investment; corporate finance; economic policy uncertainty; macro-economic & microeconomics; risk management,

The findings obtains through the PSTR model confirm this conclusion when the financial market represents more than 34% of financial institutions. For middle-income countries, the Cup-FM and Cup-BC estimators reveal that the financial system relies on banking industry. However, this result is not supported by the PSTR model. In fact, it indicates that the financial system in these countries is based on financial markets when government expenditure as percentage of gross domestic product is less than 2.62%.

To improve risk management in China's commodity futures markets, this paper employs a regular vine (R-vine) copula model to study the dependence structure of commodity futures and to enhance Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecast. In doing so, we find that China's commodity futures market is not centred on one category of commodity futures and the tail dependence between different categories of commodity futures varies significantly. Based on the dependence structure analysed using the R-vine copula model, we forecast the VaR of individual indices, which are formed of several commodity futures, as well as forecasting the VaR of an equally-weighted portfolio. Our method can outperform the standard GARCH-VaR method in terms of VaR backtesting.

Using data on listed companies in China, this article uses the panel smooth transfer regression (PSTR) model and multiple regression models to test the nonlinear relationship between capital structure and firm performance. The optimal capital structure is calculated using the partial correlation function of the PSTR model, and the ownership structure–optimal capital structure relationship is analysed. This research found that (a) the effect of the debt-to-asset ratio on firm performance shows a nonlinear relationship with sudden changes in characteristics, and a debt-to-asset ratio interval exists that can significantly improve firm performance; (b) under the premise of the effect of ownership checks and balances, an increase in ownership concentration can improve the optimal capital structure; thus, enterprises can achieve effective operations with higher debt; (c) the promotion effect of ownership concentration on firm performance varies depending on a company's debt-to-asset ratio; and (d) different industries have different optimal capital structures. The raw materials industry has a high optimal capital structure. A series of robustness tests verify the robustness of these conclusions. This research enriches the theoretical interpretation of the optimal capital structure and provides new insights into the relationship between ownership structure and firm performance.

In addition to the four segment-specific and aggregate national financial cycles estimated for each country, we also derive regional and global financial cycles. The analysis reveals highly persistent and recurring nature of financial cycles, which tend to fluctuate at frequencies lower than business cycles, 9–15 years on average, and are indicative of major financial distress episodes.

Second, ODA and remittances are found as negative factors for economic growth; notably, higher human capital accumulation of receiving countries reduces these negative impacts. Overall, the results imply that foreign financial flows are correlated differently with human capital in influencing economic growth among African countries. Nevertheless, the significant implications are that more attention must be paid to human capital in these countries, and more feasible policies are urgently needed for better absorption of external capital flows. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",economic growth; FDI; human capital; ODA; quantile regression; remittance,Africa; capital flow; developing world; economic growth; human capital; regression analysis; remittance
Fiscal decentralization and convergence in government spending in Malaysia,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092574337&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2293&partnerID=40&md5=6f09035cc95a7403226bb9fe86f6e340,"In this study, we highlight the influence of the federal system on the development expenditure of the states, which is crucial for socio-economic development. First, we examine whether there is a convergence in development expenditure across Malaysian states. Second, we investigate the importance of decentralization in affecting the pattern of development expenditure in the short-term and in the long-term. The convergence analysis utilizes annual growth data from 2000 through 2015 for the short-term and the averages of 3- and 5-year growth for the long-term. In this study, we employ the panel data approaches of pooled OLS, fixed effects and random effects estimation procedures. The findings provide empirical evidence of the convergence of development expenditure across the states in Malaysia in both the short-term and the long-term. Generally, all fiscal decentralization indicators (state per capita revenue, state own-source per capita revenue, state own-source revenue as a share of total revenue and inter-state fiscal capacity) are imperative in influencing the fiscal behaviour of state governments in Malaysia. These indicators, as well as assistance from the federal government in the form of transfer payment, are very much needed to strengthen the expenditure capacity of the Malaysian states. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",convergence; decentralization; developing country; government spending,

By employing the Autoregressive Distributed Lag Bounds Cointegration approach (ARDL) and the Fully Modified OLS model (FMOLS), the study documented broad money supply, domestic credit provided by the financial sector, domestic credit to the private sector, bank deposit to GDP, liquid liabilities to GDP, deposit money banks assets to GDP, deposit money bank assets to deposit money bank assets and central bank assets, non-life insurance premium volume to GDP, stock market capitalization to GDP and the number of listed companies to have a significant negative effect on Ghana's economic growth in the long-run. The joint effect of financial development was also found to have a significant negative effect on Ghana's economic growth from the FMOLS model. The study recommended the imperative for policymakers to increase infrastructure investment by promoting reforms to boost cooperation between civil societies, the public sector, and the private sector to address the high cost of investment to improve the macroeconomic performance of the country. The study further recommended policymakers to support the financial sector by injecting liquidity during these distress times. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Economic growth; financial development; Ghana,Ghana; banking; economic growth; Gross Domestic Product; macroeconomics; stock market

Do socially responsible firms demand high-quality audits? An international evidence,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092105149&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2270&partnerID=40&md5=91aa096e9d0803ed383b9fb98cc4ce01,"This paper investigates whether corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance influences the demand for high-quality audits in terms of audit effort measured by audit fee. Using a sample of listed firms from 20 developed countries across three regions, namely United States (US), United Kingdom (UK) and Europe (EU) over the period 2002–2016 and different measures of CSR performance (environmental and social), we find that socially responsible firms demand high-quality audits from external auditors. Further analysis shows that this result is robust to the use of alternate samples, country and firm level governance systems, and endogeneity concerns. Taken together, these findings suggest that socially responsible attributes of being ethical, honest, trustworthy, and transparent while reporting financial results motivate firms to demand high-quality audits in order to preserve their reputation or socially responsible image. The main implication of our findings is that the stakeholders may place greater confidence in the financial reports of socially responsible firms as they are likely to demand high-quality audits. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Performance; Ethical Concerns/Behaviour; Financial Reporting Quality; High-Quality Audits; Reputation Concerns,corporate social responsibility; ethics; governance approach; industrial performance

A comparison between SOEs and Non-SOEs have been analysed empirically. In this regard, the data of listed Chinese SMEs have been accumulated for the years 2012–2016. Conclusively, hierarchical CEO succession, hierarchical CEO succession intensity and its three types have been formulated while contemplating the SMEs' profile. Empirical underpinnings witness the positive impact of hierarchical CEO succession and hierarchical CEO succession intensity on state-owned SMEs performance. Moreover, medium hierarchical CEO successor has been declared to be a promoter of SMEs performance. Hierarchical CEO successor, specifically, medium hierarchical CEO successor mitigate the SMEs cash holdings vehemently. However, earnings management as a moderator invigorates the state-owned SMEs cash holdings. Remarkably, SME' performance is splendid if it is matured, designates a large percentage of independent directors and attains maximum earnings per share.

Moreover, for most oil-exporting economies, oil revenues are an essential source of fluctuations in macroeconomic variables, which necessitate the adoption of macroeconomic stabilization policies. By constructing a macro-financial DSGE model, this paper examines the role of macro-prudential policies in financial stability and how they interact with macroeconomic policies in an oil-exporting economy. Applying quarterly data of the economy of Iran during 1990–2017, the results show that macroeconomic stabilization policies are not considered as sufficient condition for financial stability. The implementation of macro-prudential instruments is necessary to reduce financial instability. Moreover, the results indicate that the cooperation of the macro-prudential and monetary authorities increases the effectiveness of the macro-prudential and monetary policies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",banking System; DSGE; financial stability; macro-prudential policies; oil-exporting economy,Iran; banking; economic policy; finance; macroeconomics; numerical model; oil supply

The empirical findings of this paper suggest that CPFTA positively contribute to Pakistan exports to China and her imports from China but the increase in Pakistan imports was far greater than Pakistan exports after CPFTA. Resultantly, Pakistan's trade deficit with China increased and Pakistan's growth hampered. Constant market share analysis suggests that a better understanding of the Chinese market, efficient utilization of tariff lines and focus on products of the comparative edge are important for Pakistan to benefit from CPFTA. Otherwise, CPFTA is counterproductive for Pakistan. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",bilateral trade; China; comparative advantage; FTA; Pakistan; trade potential,China; Pakistan; comparative advantage; economic growth; empirical analysis; export; free trade

Export and import links increase the firm-level correlation but net out for firms that both export to and import from the same market, evidence that this type of ‘natural hedging’ can help reduce a firm's exposure to foreign economic shocks. We proceed to aggregate the firm-level results to the whole economy and find that severing firm-level ties with a foreign market is predicted to lower the correlation between Swedish value added growth and foreign GDP growth from 0.72 to 0.64 on average. Gabaix's ‘granularity’ of trade is central to this result: if all firms are given equal weight overall correlations are essentially unaffected by severing firm level ties. Natural hedging is quantitatively important at the firm level and also plays a role in limiting overall comovements. © 2020 The Authors.

We also find that higher levels in GDP growth and lending interest rate and are associated with more NPLs, while higher inflation is associated with less NPLs.

This study combines these strands of the literature. Essentially, the study conjectures that Global Financial Cycle (GFCy), drawing inspiration from PBT, has some predictive information content on exchange rate. Using dataset from 25 countries, we produced some mixed results. On the whole, the GFCy is able to produce lower forecast error, as compared to the that of benchmark model.

The productivity differential is found to depend on geographical localization. Female managed firms located in the North–West regions significantly increase the positive firm productivity differential of the geographical area, while firms located in the South and Islands reduce the firm differential productivity gap registered by the area.

Since the proposal of the Belt and Road (B&R) Initiative, the RMB is shown to have made more remarkable progress as an anchor currency in B&R countries compared to non-B&R countries. The ordered logit model is then used to examine the determinants of the RMB anchor effect. The results show that the probability of the RMB being an anchor currency increases with the higher the trade integration, the higher the investment dependence, the better the RMB infrastructure and the closer the policy cooperation. The results also provide evidence on how to further strengthen the RMB anchor effect and promote the RMB internationalization in the long run. On the basis of strengthening its policy cooperation with B&R countries, China should use its sustainable growth of trade and investment to provide the impetus for RMB internationalization. Furthermore, it should optimize the layout of the RMB offshore market, increase the openness of the financial market, and strengthen currency cooperation among central banks to provide guarantees for RMB internationalization. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",anchor; belt and road initiative; exchange rate; renminbi; renminbi internationalization,China; central bank; currency market; exchange rate; financial market; globalization; infrastructural development; international cooperation; international trade; investment; sustainable development; trade policy

Using 841 observations of Malaysian firms over the period 2013–2015, we find that firms with overlapping audit and remuneration committees are perceived by debtholders to be transparent and of lower operating risk and, consequently, be associated with lower cost of debt. We also find that the beneficial effect of the presence of overlapping committees is weakened by the level of CEO power. Our results are robust to concerns of endogeneity and alternative measurers of the key variables. This study is timely in light of recently increasing call for the broadening of audit committee members' understanding of business strategies, risks and incentives provided by firms' executive compensation structures. Our study also contributes to the ongoing debate surrounding CEO power by suggesting that debtholders perceive potent CEO power as detrimental to their investments and thus charge higher interest rates from firms with powerful CEOs and overlapping directors. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",audit committee overlap; CEO power; cost of debt; Malaysia,Malaysia; business development; debt; incentive; interest rate; numerical model; perception; state role

Some empirical evidence for Ghana,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092075268&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2276&partnerID=40&md5=39ee54afedbb5822a24021c9eaa84bf7,"Informal banking activities have been increasing in many economies in recent times. These activities, though are interrelated with the formal banking activities, fall within a different regulatory framework within which the central bank conducts monetary policy. This has a potential effect on monetary transmission. The study, thus, investigated this issue in the Ghanaian perspective using the local projection approach. Using data sourced from the World Bank and Bank of Ghana databases, the study estimated an incomplete monetary pass-through for Ghana. Notwithstanding this, informal banking further weakens the pass-through. Other factors such as non-performing loans, excess liquidity and the level of financial development were identified to weaken the pass-through. These findings highlight the need for a prudent monetary framework that can address the challenge informal banking bring forth in monetary policy implementation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Ghana; informal banking; interest rate pass-through,Ghana; banking; empirical analysis; financial system; interest rate; monetary policy; policy implementation
Does culture play a role in the stock market's response to uncertainty?,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092143677&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2285&partnerID=40&md5=72eb4453f81842d979044024938037de,"While a growing body of literature documents a decrease in stock returns with an increase in economic uncertainty, the magnitude of this decrease may differ across countries. This paper examines whether a national culture that shapes its people's views towards uncertainty can serve as an explanation if there are heterogeneous responses of the stock market responses to an increase in economic uncertainty at the country level. Using the economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index to proxy for economic uncertainty and employing an SVAR model, this paper first finds that the magnitude of a stock market's response to an increase in uncertainty varies across countries. This paper then adopts the uncertainty avoidance index (UAI) as a proxy measure of culture relating to people's views towards uncertainty and finds that the observed cross-country heterogeneity is correlated with the degree of a society's uncertainty avoidance. The stock market index is likely to drop more in response to an increase in uncertainty in countries with higher uncertainty avoidance. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",economic policy uncertainty; national culture; stock market,economic policy; financial market; financial system; policy implementation; stock market; uncertainty analysis
Is there a threshold effect in the liquidity risk–non-performing loans relationship? A PSTR approach for MENA banks,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089596656&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2248&partnerID=40&md5=7bebf823c67631405acabae6e7c0a82c,"This study analyzes the nonlinear relationship between liquidity risk and nonperforming loans (NPLs) for a sample of MENA banks over the period 2004–2017. Results of the Panel Smooth Transition Regression model indicate that there is a threshold effect in the liquidity risk and NPLs relationship. More specifically, we found that above the threshold of 73.10% for loans to deposits ratio, liquidity risk significantly increases the level of NPLs. However, below the threshold of 87.61% for liquid assets to deposits and short-term funding ratio, the NPLs are also significantly and positively correlated with the liquidity risk. Furthermore, we found that NPLs are more sensitive to bank performance, bank capital, bank size, international financial crisis, and the inflation rate. However, no significant effect was found for the impact of ownership concentration and board characteristics either below or above the thresholds. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",liquidity risk; MENA banks; nonperforming loans; PSTR,Middle East; North Africa; banking; financial crisis; inflation; lending behavior; regression analysis; threshold

First, we employ Cappiello et al., Journal of Financial Economics, 2006, 4, 537–572 model and copula functions to detect and cross-check the correlations and the contagion thereafter. Second, we uncover evidence of correlation behaviour between policy uncertainty indexes and stock market returns. The results demonstrate that no country and sector was immune to spillover effects, highlighting the limited effectiveness of policy makers for both the Subprime Crisis and the European Sovereign Debt Crisis. The empirical application provides evidence of significant volatility and tail dependence from the financial sector to many real sectors in the U.S. economy.

Hedging capabilities of Bitcoin for Asian currencies,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089449541&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2241&partnerID=40&md5=dfa80a73ff08e9031ab5984c55621bd2,"This study investigates whether Bitcoin (BTC) can provide a hedge against the fiat currencies in Asia over various investment horizons. We focus on Asia because it is one of the fastest-growing regions worldwide, where cryptocurrencies are actively traded. A wavelet transform technique is combined with a multivariate factor stochastic volatility (SV) model to examine the dynamic correlation properties and risk reduction effectiveness of BTC in both the time and frequency domains. We use gold and oil as benchmarks and compared their results with those of BTC. The estimated correlations indicate that the Asian currencies tend to be negatively correlated with BTC; therefore, the latter could provide a hedge against the former over the medium (8–32 days) and long (32–64 days) terms. By contrast, Asian currencies tend to be positively correlated with oil and gold for the same horizons. We also analyze the downside risk reduction effectiveness of BTC for the portfolio of Asian currencies and find that BTC provides better risk reduction than oil and gold, particularly over the medium and long terms. This study makes significant contributions to the literature by demonstrating that the correlation properties and risk reduction effectiveness of BTC differ depending on the investment horizons. We believe our findings using the wavelet-based SV model can help heterogeneous investors detect portfolio risks and thus, identify optimal hedging strategies over various investment horizons. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Asian currencies; Bitcoin; hedge; stochastic volatility model; wavelet transform,Asia; currency; investment; stochasticity; transform; wavelet analysis
"Does counter-guarantee affect microcredit mechanism's performance on repayment?

We use a sample of 176 poor urban borrowers from the Guangzhou Municipal Labor and Social Security Bureau (GZMLSSB). Their loans were guaranteed by the Guangzhou Financing Guarantee Center (GZFGC), then counter-guaranteed by borrowers. The size of loans offered to urban borrowers varies from 20,000 RMB to 30,000 RMB per individual per year (60,000 RMB if part of a partnership and maximum of 50,000 RMB per individual in a given loan cycle). We estimated the model using a conditional mixed process given the binary dependent variable and a binary endogenous explanatory variable in the model. We find that the real estate mortgage as a financial counter-guarantee mechanism has no effects, but a training certificate as a non-financial counter-guarantee mechanism has a negative impact on the microcredit repayment rate. Group lending and focusing on women have no impact as well. The findings help to minimize the management cost of pre-default and default risk on microcredit loans in GZMLSSB and other similar projects by targeting university graduates. Our study is the first to assess the impact of microcredit mechanisms together with counter-guarantee on loan repayments in China. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",counter-guarantee; mechanisms; microcredit; repayment rate,China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; credit provision; lending behavior; mortgage lending; urban economy

Why do sukuks (Islamic bonds) need a different pricing model?,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090996070&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2269&partnerID=40&md5=0cdcd8edf4a0c6a7e3cd577d5e17f54c,"The global interest in sukuk, an Islamic alternative to bond financing, has grown rapidly, particularly after the 2008 global financial crisis, due to its distinctive features and investment quality. Sukuk were first launched in Malaysia and are presently available in 29 countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Luxembourg. Despite the global market prevalence of sukuk, asset pricing literature has not yet addressed the pricing mechanism of sukuk, which is inherently different from bonds and equity due to the contractual differences. However, analysts use LIBOR, or the Islamic interbank benchmark rate, as the ad-hoc benchmark to evaluate sukuk performance. In this study, we develop a basic pricing model that captures the common risks in sukuk returns. We identify two risk factors for sukuk that require risk premiums: (a) sukuk market risk and (b) information asymmetry risk. Using these two common sukuk risks factors, investment analysts can estimate the fair value of sukuk more precisely than other ad hoc measures available. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",reference rate; sukuk pricing; systematic risk factors; two factor model,Belgium; China; Hong Kong; Luxembourg [Belgium]; Malaysia; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; United Kingdom; United States; benchmarking; capital market; factor analysis; financial crisis; financial market; investment; price dynamics

Furthermore, FMOLS, DOLS and Cup-FMOLS are applied to examine impact of scale effect, technique effect, composition effect, financial development, oil prices and economic globalization on energy consumption. The empirical results show that variables are cointegrated for long run relationship. Scale effect and technique effect are negatively and positively linked with energy consumption. Composition effect and economic globalization stimulate energy consumption. Contrarily, financial development and oil prices decline energy consumption.

This relationship is driven by the asymmetric large return sensitivity of short-leg of momentum portfolio to changes in market liquidity that increases the tail risk of the momentum strategy in panic states. Identifying this partly explains the forecasting ability of known predictors of tail risk of the momentum strategy. The contemporaneous increase in market liquidity explains, to some extent, the documented negative relationship between predictors and future momentum returns.

An empirical examination of the impact of country-level corporate governance on profitability of Indian banks,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089991479&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2250&partnerID=40&md5=d6d59b3bf1116c69b6e1df543cfa58d6,"The main aim of the present study is to examine the impact of country-level corporate governance on the profitability of Indian banks using a sample of 61 banks that is, 42 private and 19 public banks. The study employs descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, regression analysis of two-way variable intercept random effect model, and robustness checks including robust regression, Generalized Methods of Moments, and Panel Correction Standard Error. The results reveal that country-level corporate governance has a significant impact on the profitability of Indian banks. Private banks demonstrate better performance over public banks and the effect of country-level governance on the profitability of private banks is positive and it is better than public banks. Further, the results show that demonetisation has a significant negative impact on the profitability of Indian banks as measured by Return on Assets and Return on Equity, but it also has a significant positive effect in the case of Net Interest Margin. The findings of the current study have considerable implications for regulators, policymakers, bankers, analysts, and academicians. Regulations and several policy measures could be introduced to improve the profitability of Indian banks. To promote greater transparency, better accountability, strong rule of law, and corporate governance, corruption must be eliminated to enhance higher profitability of Indian banks. This paper presents novel evidence linking country-level corporate governance to the profitability of banks in the context of India, as an emerging economy. Therefore, it bridges an existing gap in the body of literature on the profitability of banks in India. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",country-level corporate governance; India; private banks; profitability; public banks,India; banking; corporate strategy; profitability

The analysis tests certain hypotheses, such as: (i) the housing wealth effect on consumption is stronger than its financial counterpart, (ii) overall wealth effects increase (decrease) during bubble (post bubble) periods, (iii) the higher level of financial development and the lower level of housing affordability ratio both result in stronger wealth effects, (iv) increasing wealth effects show a bubble formation. The results suggest that housing wealth has generally a greater positive effect on consumption. The effect of housing and financial wealth on consumption increases, depending on higher financial development and declining housing affordability.

Firstly, we implement the technique of Diebold–Yilmaz to compute the spillover index between cryptocurrencies and currency markets. We find a significant return spillover effect between Bitcoin and Litecoin in the first three quarters of 2017. Still, the return spillover is merely meaningful in the first three quarters of 2015 for Ripple. However, the total volatility spillover index in the system decreases in the fourth quarter of 2017. Secondly, we apply the Bayesian graphical structural vector, autoregressive estimations, and find that the current level of Bitcoin depends only on the previous level of the Chinese Yuan. The current level of Ripple strongly depends on the prior levels of Bitcoin, followed by Litecoin. The current level of Litecoin strongly depends on the previous level of Ripple, followed by the Chinese Yuan. These results indicate that there is a significant causal relationship among cryptocurrencies.

Monetary policy reaction to uncertainty in Japan: Evidence from a quantile-on-quantile interest rate rule,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091133368&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2258&partnerID=40&md5=ea6828bd997703ef1dbad12c75a595b9,"Japan's episodes of lower bound of interest rates together with macroeconomic uncertainty for over the past two decades stands as a tremendous hurdle for the estimation of Taylor-type rule models. We demarcate our study from previous literature by conducting the estimations not only at various points on the conditional distribution of the interest rate but also at various quantiles of an additional regressor on top of inflation and output, viz., an economic uncertainty measure, by adopting a quantile nonseparable triangular system estimation. The results show that the reaction to uncertainty seems to have substituted the Bank's reaction to inflation and output, lending support to the Brainard attenuation principle. In essence, faced with higher economic uncertainty, the monetary authority reacts by cutting (attenuating) its policy rate across all quantiles of uncertainty at all conditional quantiles of interest rate, with an increased response of the Bank of Japan to uncertainty at its lower quantiles when interest rate is at its lower conditional quantiles. A possible explanation is the greater concern of getting out from the lower bounds of interest rate amidst deflationary outcomes. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",conditional quantile on quantile regressions; interest rate rule; Japan; shadow rate of interest; uncertainty; zero lower bound,Japan; interest rate; monetary policy; numerical model; regression analysis; uncertainty analysis

For our purpose, we use the local Gaussian correlation approach during the dot-com, global financial, European sovereign debt crises and the more recent period involving the Brexit in the UK. The employed method not only avoids the bias of the conditional correlation, but also describes any nonlinear structure in dependence and the deviation from global normality. In general, we find strong evidence of nonlinear contagion between equities and REITs of not only matured and established markets, but also in economies with an emerging REITs sector, especially during the global financial and sovereign debt crises. Further, when we considered contagion across REITs of the US and the other countries, and between US REITs and equities of the remaining 18 countries, a similar pattern emerges.

The results we obtain confirm that macroeconomic information strengthens the accuracy of models forecasting credit default of non-financial firms. With a negative effect on the probability of default, GDP growth stands out among the key macroeconomic predictors of default. Yet, we find compelling evidence that asymmetries exist within the Eurozone regarding the benign effects of GDP growth over credit risk; the reduction of the probability of default due to economic growth mostly occurs in economies more exposed to conditions of financial stress. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Credit default; crisis; Eurozone; macroeconomic effects; multi-period logit model,Europe; financial crisis; financial market; financial system; Gross Domestic Product; logit analysis; macroeconomics

As far as whole set of countries is concerned, our findings imply that countries having developed financial systems, qualified institutions and stable macroeconomic environment benefit from financial integration. Moreover, threshold effects are stronger and different for emerging countries compared to the industrial countries. Unlike emerging economies, higher levels of financial integration and trade openness decrease benefits from financial openness for the industrial countries. Besides, high fiscal deficit has more pronounced negative effect on the growth of the industrialized countries compared to emerging economies and other indicators. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",financial integration; growth; nonlinearity; panel data; smooth transition regression,developing world; economic growth; financial market; financial services; nonlinearity; panel data; regression analysis
The impacts of oil price shocks and United States economic uncertainty on global stock markets,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089567163&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2232&partnerID=40&md5=acf521c374c70c5eeb907e683fb9bf38,"This article examines interdependence between oil price shocks and United States economic uncertainty and their effects on global stock markets within a structural VAR model over the last 40 years. I find that aggregate demand shocks cause a transitory rise in global real stock returns, whereas precautionary oil demand and United States economic uncertainty shocks decline the returns. Especially, oil demand shocks significantly increase United States economic uncertainty, indicating that their direct impacts on global stock markets are amplified by its endogenous response. Variance decomposition analysis shows that oil price shocks and United States economic uncertainty explain 17% and 6% of long-run variations in global real stock returns, respectively. These figures have more than tripled when the model is estimated on post 2000 data, suggesting that oil market fundamentals and United States macro uncertainty are an important determinant of global stock market movements. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",oil shocks; stock returns; structural VAR; United States economic uncertainty,United States; decomposition analysis; oil supply; price dynamics; stock market; uncertainty analysis; vector autoregression
The predictive power of the term spread on inequality in the United Kingdom: An empirical analysis,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090961048&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2254&partnerID=40&md5=802170b64f9331f9fd021cef7d60fa22,"A common tool in forecasting literature used in predicting future economic conditions is the term spread, which tends to contract near peaks and rise near troughs. Building on this known relationship, this paper explores the predictive power of the yield spread on the distribution of income in the United Kingdom (UK). The results reveal that income inequality responds negatively to increases in the yield spread over the medium-term. Specifically, we show that the term spread can help to predict UK's income inequality growth both in- and out-of-sample. Our empirical findings show that it is the expected component of the term spread that has predictive power for lower income inequality in the UK. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",inequality; predictions; term premium; yield spread,United Kingdom; economic conditions; future prospect; income distribution; literature review; low income population; prediction

Using the results of the Lerner index, we find evidence of the significant decrease in market power for the ECB supervised entities in Austria, France, Germany and Spain. In a similar vein, the Boone indicator points towards an increase in competition among significant supervised entities of Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The evidence on changes for the total banking sector are mixed, whereas no significant effect is found for the banks remaining under national supervision. We do not find any support for significant increases in the market power of banks in Italy or Spain, suggesting that large increases in concentration do not necessarily result in anticompetitive conduct. © 2020 The Authors.

We apply the monthly data of country-specific economic policy uncertainty indices and realized volatility to calculate the directional spillover indicator. Then we use a Fourier transformation to calculate the frequency of spillovers to study the duration of the spillover effect. We find that the spillover effect of EPU on stock market volatility is relatively large in the U.S., Japan and Canada, and has certain regional similarities. EPU has longer spillover effects on the stock markets of France, Germany and Italy, which is strongest over 3–18 months. Finally, important economic events such as the financial crisis and the Brexit, increased EPU spillover level and lasting time. We provide the dynamic and frequency spillover characteristics between EPU and the stock market in G7 countries, making this study useful for international asset allocation and risk management. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",economic policy uncertainty; frequency spillover; realized volatility; stock market,France; Germany; Italy; economic policy; frequency analysis; spillover effect; stock market; uncertainty analysis
The non-payout functions of deposit insurance schemes,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090023401&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2240&partnerID=40&md5=521abda3b7a2d29dc65cbc0a61c14d80,"Institutional and functional development of entities responsible for the provision of deposit insurance remains a marginal area of scientific research. The literature does not offer comprehensive analyses of the organization of deposit guarantee schemes (DGS), including the identification of all their possible tasks supporting the performance of its main goal (deposit insurance). Nevertheless, the potential synergies and cost savings justify broad range of tasks that could be carried out by DGSs in order to facilitate their functioning. At the same time, the problem of the functional shape of DGS is also of utmost practical importance. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to fill the identified gap by classifying the non-payout functions and presenting the empirical review about them. To this end, the activities of 109 deposit guarantors around the world were analyzed. The review allowed to distinguish seven DGS functions supplementary to the payout of covered deposits, as well as to examine the interdependencies between the recognized roles and evaluate in terms of the DGSs' fulfillment of their objectives. Additionally, the advantages and disadvantages of every supplementary DGS activity were presented. The analysis allowed for the distinction of desired functions of deposit guarantee schemes. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",bank restructuring; crisis preparedness; deposit insurance scheme; financial markets; financial safety net; financial stability; social responsibility,banking; crisis management; empirical analysis; financial market; insurance system

To tackle the issue, we propose novel complex networks methods to identify financial crises and explain some performance of the Chinese stock market. Firstly, we use the daily closing prices to construct the dynamical complex networks and their minimum spanning tree (MST) maps. Secondly, we characterize topological evolution of dynamical MSTs by employing normalized tree length, node degree distribution, centrality measures, node strength distribution and edge survival ratios. Furthermore, empirical analyses show that: (i) the normalized tree length can be used to identify financial crises, it declines sharply in the run-up to, and during the financial crisis, and increases rapidly afterwards; (ii) the normalized tree length is positively correlated with market return and negatively correlated with market tail risk and volatility; (iii) the closeness centrality of most stocks is significantly negatively correlated with individual returns and positively correlated with individual volatility; (iv) the node degree and node strength in most of MSTs follow the power-law distribution; (v) the edge survival ratio analysis indicates that the dependence structure of the Chinese stock market is relatively stable. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Chinese stock market; complex network; financial crises; market performance; minimum spanning tree,China; financial crisis; market conditions; mortgage lending; performance assessment; power law distribution; stock market; topology

We compare our own spot rates estimation from GovPX bond data and three popular available interest rate datasets.

In order to achieve this objective, this study uses International Monetary Fund aside from World Bank database and standards, more specifically financial development and credit bureau coverage variables. Results indicate a positive impact of credit bureaus over financial development. The potential channel associated with this effect might be related to the information produced by credit bureaus, which implies a reduction in asymmetric information in credit markets, thus, leading to a lower level of risk associated with borrowers and, consequently, reducing the risks faced by banks. With lower levels of uncertainty and risk, banks tend to lend more, improving financial development, which could suggest the adoption of a policy to create or stimulate credit bureaus coverage. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",credit information; developing countries; financial development,credit provision; developing world; financial crisis; financial market; financial services; monetary union

Specifically, though the average external debt-to-GDP ratio has declined by 22% points between 2005 and 2016, since 2012, however, external debt has steadily increased in HIPCs. Using panel data over the period 2005–2016, the article finds that economic growth rate, nominal exchange rate and remittance inflows negatively and significantly affect the ratio of external debt-to-GDP.

The investigation is carried-out using asymmetric threshold regression developed by Hansen (1999, 2000) through 1,000 bootstrapping replications and the grid search. Our empirical results based on 44 SSA countries reveal a significant single threshold of 2.60%. We consider the effects of real income, openness, and the terms of trade on the real exchange rate measures, which exhibited a significant effect on the exporter's currency-invoicing when exceeds beyond the threshold's values. Furthermore, we also consider the distribution of the effect of the regressors on currency-invoice and found significant quantile coefficients appeared differently from the OLS coefficients. The quantile estimates for the exchange rate pass-through reveal an asymmetry and gradual decay on the real exchange rate coefficients from 10th quantile. Hence, the pass-through on the exporter's currency-invoice is incomplete. Besides, the dynamic panel two-step difference GMM estimators revealed statistically significant short-run and long-run impacts of ERPT on exporter's currency-invoice in 44 SSA countries.

The study reports some insightful findings. The results show that, financial inclusion is less developed in Tanzania than in other East African countries contrary to expectations. According to expectations from development finance theories financial inclusion directly relates to economic development. However, Tanzania having better GDP than its neighbour countries ranks behind other countries with lower GDPs. One may say that weak financial system, inappropriate policy and poor financial instruments hamper significant effect of finance on growth. The paper argues that regardless of a significant economic growth reported in Tanzania inability of the financial system to reach majority of the population may be considered as a major reason behind the unexpected link between economic growth and financial inclusion. Furthermore, the study shows that financial inclusion is positively related to the income level and education level of the households, and negatively relates to gender. Moreover, a non-linear relationship between age and financial inclusion is reported- that is the relation is positive at a certain age level, and change to negative at a higher age level.Consequently, the study recommends promoting equal participation in both labor and financial markets, and that East African's Governments to fully capture the dynamics of markets and track informal as well as formal economic activities to attract inclusive economy which will, ultimately, match with financial inclusion agenda. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Tanzania; economic activity; economic growth; education; financial market; financial system; household income; labor participation; policy approach

Although recent empirical investigations document a positive effect of the bank levies (BL), it may also reduce banks' activity. In this paper, we aim to analyse the Polish BL on assets. Poland's interbank market might be affected by a new BL introduced in 2016, as interbank positions of the balance sheet have been also taxed. The analysis covers the panel structure of data of Polish banks with unconsolidated financial statements. To evaluate the impact of the BL on the above interbank market features, we use the OLS regression with fixed effects in relation to the bank. Data has been sourced from OrbisFocus and Central Banks' websites and covers the period 2011–2017. The result demonstrates that the BL on assets applied in Poland has a negative impact on the interbank market. Estimation results shows that the BL on assets significantly decrease the value of 1y and increases the value of 3 months interbank loans. In addition, the BL on assets in the banking sector positively affects the value of government securities and negatively affects the interest income on interbank loans. Moreover, the dispersion of 1 and 3 months quotations was reduced as a result of the BL introduction. In case of short-term transactions, dispersion amplifies. Additionally, the volatility of quotation decreases due to reduced trading after the BL implementation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Poland [Central Europe]; banking; central bank; financial market; regression analysis; trade

It has experienced several stagnation episodes and was plagued, from the mid-1970s to the early 2000s, by hyperinflation. This phenomenon took place at different moments in time and with varying intensity. Using a novel data set for Chile, we identify the main drivers of fiscal reforms and seigniorage shocks that were crucial for inflation dynamics. We conclude that inflation, after the military coup that deposed Allende's socialist government, was used to finance defence spending non-explicitly considered in the official figures. We interpret these fiscal expenditures as seigniorage shocks. Hence, the Chilean economy was addicted to fiscal deficits for most of the 1970s. Addiction to inflation, in the form of destabilizing inflation expectations that evolved independently of the level of seignorage, was not relevant. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,Chile; financial crisis; fiscal reform; income distribution; inflation; public spending; social mobility

The long-run relationships between the stock markets of the Baltic States and selected developed stock markets are studied by means of cointegration analysis on the weekly returns. For the Baltic stock markets and key indices from the European markets, the empirical results over period 2005–2015 provide clear evidence that the Baltic stock markets are integrated with the Swedish stock market, and that this cointegrating relationship implies transmission of shocks from Sweden to the Baltic States. The cointegration analysis is also conducted for rolling windows over consequent sub-samples, which only verifies the robustness of the integration between the stock markets of the Baltic States and Sweden. Given that there is no support for the long-term relationships between the Baltic market and euro area, it may be that Baltic markets offer diversification benefits for the euro area indices. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Baltic States; Sweden; Western Europe; financial market; market development; stock market
Financial crises and institutional quality,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090090659&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2228&partnerID=40&md5=534597cd912a847845fc4a37f0e33cb0,"Are financial crises particularly bad for economies, if the institutional quality deteriorates at the onset of crises? Policy responses can mitigate adverse consequences of financial crises. However, implementation and effectiveness of prudent policy actions are in turn dependent on the institutional environment. Using panel data for a large set of countries, I show that a weakening in the institutional quality within the period of a banking crisis is associated with additional output losses, above and beyond the effects of the individual banking crisis and weakening in the institutional quality, which are long lasting. This is not the case for a deterioration in the institutional quality within the periods of debt and currency crises. Finally, I document that additional losses from a deterioration in the institutional quality at the onset of a banking crisis are more pronounced in financially less open economies in which domestic policy actions are potentially more crucial in recovery. These suggest that policymakers should take steps to strengthen the institutional environment to facilitate recovery, especially during the periods of banking distress. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,banking; financial crisis; financial policy; panel data
Financial frictions and wage inequality,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090060798&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2200&partnerID=40&md5=2efb4740786e6cb727706162fffea2f1,"This paper investigates how financial frictions affect skilled-unskilled wage inequality. In both the cost constrained model and the quantity constrained model, we find that a decrease of financial frictions in the skilled (resp. unskilled) sector will increase (resp. decrease) wage inequality when there is a properly large elasticity of substitution between capital and skilled labor (resp. unskilled labor). In sum, the role of financial frictions is sector-specific, which is largely neglected by the existing literature. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,elasticity; financial market; financial system; income distribution; skilled labor; wage determination
Are public spending determinants significant in per capita budget spending decisions in Nigeria?,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089520835&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2146&partnerID=40&md5=ec98de7cde2690f9cb587cbf88b04869,"The motivation for this study had been to assess whether the established determinants of public spending decisions in Nigeria which are government revenue, the inflation rate, the exchange rate, the growth rate of real gross domestic product, and the international price of oil, do actually affect per capita budget spending as assumed by the fiscal authorities. However, evidence from the baseline symmetric and asymmetric auto-regressive distributive lag regressions suggest otherwise. A further probe by adding population growth rate, and gross fixed capital formation to the baseline variables to have a robust regression, suggests that while gross fixed capital formation which measures for infrastructure development was insignificant, population growth rate was crucial for the instituted determinants to exert substantial effect on per capita spending. This outcome can be taken as evidence of why the budget on a yearly basis is being perceived by most citizens as an ineffective tool of fiscal policy. Since the fiscal authorities have continued to always assume that factors that play crucial role in formulating their spending decisions; are the same with those necessary in deciding the share of Nigerians in the budget; without due consideration for population growth. Hence, ridiculing whatever goal the budget is set out to achieve. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,Nigeria; capital; decision making; Gross Domestic Product; infrastructural development; population growth; public spending; regression analysis

In the first step, we estimate a traditional-type panel vector autoregressive (VAR) model and analyse the evolution of credit procyclicality in the CEECs by comparing the impulse response functions for different business cycle periods. The results confirm the existence of credit procyclicality in the CEECs and show that procyclicality is higher during boom periods. Furthermore, we observe the heterogeneity of credit procyclicality in the different countries in our sample. To explain the cross-country heterogeneity in credit procyclicality we construct an interacted panel VAR model and analyse whether bank-level competition, proxied by the aggregate Lerner index, constitutes a driving force of credit procyclicality. Our findings indicate that bank competition affects credit procyclicality and explains the differences in credit dynamics across the CEECs. Specifically, we show that the reaction of credit to a gross domestic product shock is on average higher in a less competitive banking market. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Central Europe; Eastern Europe; banking; competitiveness; computer simulation; credit provision; financial market; heterogeneity; numerical model; vector autoregression

Empirical study on the impact of major asset restructuring on the price of sub-new stocks in Chinese A-shares,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090450776&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2225&partnerID=40&md5=5cdad2bf8d961ffc294f2bade30a742f,"With the improvement of Chinese economic status, Chinese A-share market has attracted more and more attention from international investors. Sub-new stock is a general name for the companies which list less than a year, most companies of this category come from the China Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) and are high-tech companies with high growth. To study the influence of major asset restructuring on the stock prices of different companies, this paper adopts the event study method to calculate the samples' abnormal return in a 20-day window period, compares related party transactions and unrelated party transactions, as well as different payment methods for the restructuring. The analysis shows that the listed companies of Growth Enterprise Market can get higher excess returns, the sample of unrelated transaction obtains more abnormal income than the sample of related transaction.

The HAR-RV model is our benchmark model. We utilize two popular shrinkage methods of the elastic net and lasso to solve the overfitting problem. In addition, we establish the HAR-RV-AVERAGE model by an easy combination approach. Our empirical results indicate that the HAR-RV-AVERAGE model exhibits the best prediction performance in predicting the RV of most indices and developed countries equity markets benefit the most from the inclusion of US-based crude oil and equity market volatility information, while emerging country stock markets benefit the least, especially for Asian equity indices.

Thus, in an effort to extend the literature by shedding additional light on the validity of the J-curve hypothesis, this study revisits the J-curve hypothesis using data on bilateral trade involving China and the U.S. Results from error correction estimation show that an increase in domestic as well as foreign income significantly improves China's trade balance with U.S., while the monetary variables (both domestic and foreign) have no effect on that trade balance. The key finding is that a depreciation of China's currency initially worsens its trade balance, but, over time, its trade balance improves. This pattern supports the J-curve hypothesis that is tested in prior studies with mixed results. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,China; United States; currency market; empirical analysis; international trade; trade flow; trade performance

We use the VECH specification of the multivariate GARCH model. The results indicate the existence of significant co-movement of returns although some important differences before and after the elections are noted. Lagged values of the US returns significantly affect all other market returns in the pre-election period, but not in the post-election period. There is also evidence of volatility spillovers.

De-dollarization in Zimbabwe: What lessons can be learned from other sub-Saharan countries?,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090190660&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2177&partnerID=40&md5=f2713dd1a09ff46d5f72923c4fea9fa9,"Zimbabwe has had a tumultuous currency history. In 2019, it introduced a new currency. To make the new currency widely acceptable, International experience suggests that the introduction of a new currency, following a period of official dollarization, requires the introduction of policies that go beyond just changing the law. This paper, aims to draw lessons from other African countries on how to de-dollarize effectively. Using various econometric techniques and a new database, this paper documents the pattern of dollarization in African economies over the last decade and assesses the determinants of dollarization compared to the rest of the world. It illustrates that despite an improved macroeconomic environment, dollarization remains elevated, likely due to the region's volatile history. This indicates that dollarization should decline going forward provided that macroeconomic stability is achieved and preserved. The lessons for Zimbabwe are also that it's important to use legal, regulatory and market based incentives to nudge de-dollarization, and that it will take time. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Zimbabwe; currency market; financial market; financial services; financial system; macroeconomics; regulatory framework

There is also evidence that the probability of currency crises increases when right-wing parties are in office. Moreover, time in office of incumbent chief executives reduces the likelihood of any type of financial crises. The incidence of twin and triple crises is lower when majority governments are in office.

Using national representative household survey data from China, we show that the Internet has a significant positive effect on households' private insurance participation. Then, we use both an instrumental variable analysis and propensity score matching to identify this causal effect. Furthermore, we find that this positive effect of the Internet is mainly driven by positive information on News Portals. In contrast, information regarding insurance on BBSs is usually negative and, thus, has a deterrent effect on insurance participation. Additionally, we examine the role of trust in these impacts. The results show that netizens with a high level of trust are more likely to purchase insurance, indicating that trusting the information received online is an essential factor for participating in private insurance. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,China; household survey; insurance industry; Internet; local participation
Role of financial development in economic growth in the light of asymmetric effects and financial efficiency,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090058659&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2157&partnerID=40&md5=eebd3f14edf75346374f73cb286024cd,"The growth effects of financial development might be asymmetric and nonlinear according to the level of financialization of countries. As a corollary to this notion, in the subject study, we developed a three-regime threshold autoregressive distributed lags (TARDL) model, which allows us to accommodate the asymmetric effect of financial development on economic growth in top 10 financially developed countries. We augmented the TARDL model by including trade openness, capital formation and labour as potential determinants of economic growth. The empirical findings revealed the existence of threshold asymmetric co-integration between variables. In particular, in the upper regime, financial development boosts economic growth in Singapore while it exerts a negative impact on economic growth in Finland. In the middle regime, financial development increases economic growth in Australia and Singapore. However, in the lower regime, financial development hampers economic growth in the US, Malaysia and Singapore. Trade openness has a positive long-run influence on economic growth in Canada, South Africa, Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Finland and Norway. Capital formation strengthens economic growth in the US and Malaysia in the long-run. Labour is found to sustain economic growth in the long-run for Malaysia and Singapore. The dynamic multipliers which depict the response path of economic growth to a one-unit shock of financial development in the three regimes highlight the discrepancies in the reaction of economic growth to financial development shocks occurring in different regimes. Important policy implications can be instigated from the empirical results. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,Australia; Finland; Malaysia; New Zealand; Norway; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; United States; capital; economic growth; labor; trade openness
A firm level analysis of asymmetric response of U.S. stock returns to exchange rate movements,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089588888&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2210&partnerID=40&md5=ad640a9cae516793ea73968dbb430d5a,"The extant studies on stock returns–exchange rate nexus have been suspected of aggregation bias, we therefore resolve to revisit the nexus using firm-level data while also accounting for asymmetry. We utilize stock price data covering 326 firms listed in S&P500 index and organized into 11 sectors. We examine the probable asymmetric response of these firms to exchange rate movements using the nonlinear panel ARDL method which simultaneously accounts for any inherent asymmetry and heterogeneity effects and suitable for large N and Large T panels. We establish that asymmetry exists in the stock returns–exchange rate nexus predominantly in the short run. We further show that exchange rate appreciation (depreciation) produces primarily positive (negative) effects on stock returns. We also find that the positive impacts overwhelm the negative impacts in magnitude and statistical significance. Thus, returns on investment in U.S. stocks differ significantly between currency appreciation and depreciation and by implication investors seeking to maximize returns need to exercise some level caution when confronted with sharp swings in exchange rate particularly during turbulent periods. While the results are robust to data frequency and to an extent, the choice of foreign currency, they are sensitive to different market conditions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,United States; exchange rate; heterogeneity; market conditions; nonlinearity; stock market
"Deconstructing three-stage overall efficiency into input, output and stability efficiency components with consideration of market power and loan loss provision: An application to Chinese banks",2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088600204&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2185&partnerID=40&md5=d5bdda571f1dd76208bdf803785eca6c,"The current study proposes a new three-stage network data envelopment analysis (DEA) model to estimate three different types of efficiencies. More specifically, the input efficiency is estimated in the first stage, followed by the evaluation of stability efficiency in the second stage, and finally, the output efficiency is derived from the final stage. In particular, we consider market power in deposits and market power in loans in the banking production process. Rather than using non-performing loans as an undesirable output, this paper innovatively uses loan loss provisions in bank production. We argue that the loan loss provisions are helpful to improve bank stability because they provide a cushion to absorb unexpected losses, therefore we treat it as a good intermediate output in the second stage and a good intermediate input in the third stage. The results exhibit that the scores of stability inefficiency are the highest, followed by output inefficiency, while Chinese commercial banks have the lowest level of input inefficiency. Not only did we observe that the Chinese banking industry has the highest level of stability inefficiency, but we also noticed that the stability inefficiency had the strongest volatility during 2007–2017. We also explore the impact of non-performing loan ratios from three different geographical areas on bank efficiency in China in a second-phase regression analysis, the results of which show that the input inefficiency results from higher levels of financial risk from the central area in China, while the western area in China has the opposite sign. © 2020 The Authors.

Employing the System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), the following insightful outcomes are established. First, while there is an unrestricted positive impact of physical access to ATMs and ICT measures of financial inclusion on SSA's growth, only the former was found significant. Second, the four institutional components via economic, political, institutional and general governances were also found to be growth-spurring. Lastly, countries with low levels of real per capita income are catching=up with other countries with high levels of real income per capita. The empirical evidence of some negative net effects and insignificant marginal impacts are indications that imperfections in the financial markets are sometimes employed to the disadvantage of the poor. On the whole, we established positive effects on growth for the most part. The positive effects are evident because the governance indicators complement financial inclusion in reducing pecuniary constraints hindering credit access and allocation to the poor that deteriorate growth. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Sub-Saharan Africa; accessibility; banking; financial market; financial system; governance approach; growth rate; information and communication technology; institutional framework

Does petroleum tax revenue drive sales tax effort of Indian states?

From empirical analysis, it is observed that sales tax revenue is significantly influenced by higher non-agriculture GSDP, greater supply of bank credit and higher urbanization. The calculation of Sales tax effort is found to be overstated when petroleum tax revenue is included in sales tax. States' sales tax effort tends to become lower when the influence of petroleum tax revenue is factored out. It is found that Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala and Haryana are the top five states with greater sales tax effort, inclusive of petroleum tax revenue, during the said period. The West Bengal, Maharashtra, Bihar, Goa and Madhya Pradesh are the bottom five states. Further, it is observed that only half of the states in India have shown improvement in their tax effort between 2011–12 and 2016–17, indicating no uniform improvement across the states. From the robustness analysis, a regression model exhibit similar results. Therefore, it can be suggested that assessment of the sales tax effort of Indian states should be made after having excluded the petroleum tax revenues from sales tax. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Bihar; Goa; India; Madhya Pradesh; Maharashtra; West Bengal; marketing; modeling; petroleum hydrocarbon; regression analysis; tax system

However, there persists an efficiency gap among banks with different ownership structure, suggesting that privatization matters for performance improvement. One of the major contributions is the analysis of the impact of non-performing loans on bank performance. We argue that this category of loans and bank size have nonlinear effects on the estimated efficiency levels. Medium-sized banks are more efficient than big and small banks. This finding implies that the ongoing restructuring scheme pushing banks' scale expansion via capital build-up should be carefully taken into consideration. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Viet Nam; banking; capital market; efficiency measurement; financial crisis; financial system; lending behavior; liberalization; nonlinearity; performance assessment
The impact of mandatory K-IFRS adoption on IPO underpricing,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089782591&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2203&partnerID=40&md5=38b65e9105918c3eb52cd3bb1c18ee4f,"This paper examines whether mandatory Korean International Financial Reporting Standards (K-IFRS) adoption in Korea reduces initial public offering (IPO) underpricing. We find that IPO underpricing has increased following the mandatory adoption of K-IFRS in 2011. We also show that this relation is more pronounced for non-chaebol firms, firms not backed by venture capital, and firms in concentrated industries. This suggests that the negative impact of K-IFRS adoption is concentrated on the firms with a greater pre-adoption information asymmetry. Our results indicate that some policy consideration is needed in order to help investors adapt to the newly adopted standards, especially to those related to firms seeking to go public.

Modelling cryptocurrency high–low prices using fractional cointegrating VAR,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089554706&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2164&partnerID=40&md5=f6d2412fd1301113c687f35301cc6246,"This paper empirically provides support for fractional cointegration of high and low cryptocurrency price series, using particularly, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple; synchronized at different high time frequencies. The difference of high and low price gives the price range, and the range-based estimator of volatility is more efficient than the return-based estimator of realized volatility. A more general fractional cointegration technique applied is the Fractional Cointegrating Vector Autoregressive framework. The results show that high and low cryptocurrency prices are actually cointegrated in both stationary and non-stationary levels; that is, the range of high–low price. It is therefore quite interesting to note that the fractional cointegration approach presents a lower measure of the persistence for the range compared to the fractional integration approach, and the results are insensitive to different time frequencies. The main finding in this work serves as an alternative volatility estimation method in cryptocurrency and other assets' price modelling and forecasting. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,currency; modeling; price determination
Assessment on estimations of currency basket weights—With coefficient correction for common factor dominance,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091790045&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2222&partnerID=40&md5=8ccdbe43c3ab3fcec7c43eaadd2c1c54,"This paper proposes an approach to correcting parameter misrepresentation under the dominance of a common factor, a customarily overlooked phenomenon. Meanwhile, it provides a general solution to a specific regression bias, namely coefficient correction for common factor dominance in econometrics, which is commonly encountered in the research on currency interactions and co-movements and beyond. The RMB basket weights are then scrutinized exhaustively, going through all stages of the evolving RMB regime and reforms. Correct and sensible currency basket weights are derived accordingly. It has been found that only the introduction of the central parity regime in 2015 has changed the RMB exchange rate patterns notably. The RMB market behavior and patterns virtually did not change during the prior reforms that had widened the band of daily fluctuation in the RMB exchange rate against the US dollar from 0.3% through to 2%, given the band's unique link to the US dollar. © 2020 The Authors.

Impact of information on winners' curse and long run performance of initial public offerings,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089753371&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2186&partnerID=40&md5=54956b26a424896dc698dc96ae511835,The current research focuses on the short run and long run performance of initial public offerings (IPOs) during 2005–2012. The study evaluates the impact of informational variables (both internal and external) on the first day returns. The performances have been measured through market adjusted excess return (MAER) and buy and hold abnormal returns (BHAR). A structural equation model (SEM) has been designed to identify how information affects the short run performance of IPOs. The results reveal that new issues are underpriced thereby proving winners' curse hypothesis. The study highlights that the informational variables have a significant effect on first day returns. The results also indicate that the average long run returns are negative. The results of this study will assist global investors in decision making and will facilitate active participation of these investors in IPOs in emerging markets like India. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,,India; decision making; investment; market conditions; performance assessment; public access

However, economic growth in the region plunged from 6.5% recorded in 2014 down to 6.0% in 2015 and reduced drastically to 3.5% in 2016. This study employs the generalized two-stage least square instrumental variables regression to examine growth catalysts and the challenges and prospects of sustaining economic growth. The empirical results suggest that external resources significantly promote economic growth and pose a significant threat to growth sustainability, given the uncertainty and globally declining trend in external resource inflows to Africa. Furthermore, the domestic savings rate was found to contribute significantly to economic growth, indicating that the sustainability of economic growth will require a deliberate effort to mobilize domestic resources. Finally, the study established that, while participation in the COMESA trading bloc by member-countries does not significantly impact the region, the joint participation of some COMESA members in both COMESA and Southern African Development Community (SADC) trading blocs has a detrimental effect on economic growth in the region. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,East Africa; South Africa; economic growth; regional economy; sustainability; sustainable development

For this purpose, it employs GARCH models by using real-time data on macroeconomic news and exchange rates. The results exhibit that daily Pak rupee exchange rates dynamics are linked to macroeconomic fundamentals. Both foreign and domestic macroeconomic news announcements significantly affect Pak rupee exchange rates. The exchange rate returns and volatility of Pak rupee immediately adjust to most of the foreign and domestic macroeconomic news. Most of the US and PAK domestic macroeconomic news immediately affect PKR/USD exchange rates as compared to the effect of other foreign and domestic macroeconomic news on other Pak rupee exchange rates. Finally, the article shows that Pak rupee exchange rate returns and their volatilities are responsive to foreign and domestic macroeconomic news announcements with different magnitudes for all the currency pairs.

Innovation, shown as a cause of technological developments, contributes to the transformation of technology into social and economic benefits. Innovation changes the structure of employment. However, there is no consensus in the literature about how innovation affects employment. Some suggest that technological innovations will lead to an increase in unemployment as a result of the substitution of machines instead of labour. The others state that technological innovations can improve the working life and create a reducing effect of unemployment as a result of every technological innovation creating their own fields of work. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of innovation on unemployment. The data of 12 EU countries with high and relatively low level of innovation were analysed with the panel threshold model for the period of 1998–2015.

The significance of asymmetric information in realized volatility of stock market forecasting is also considered by examining the case of good and bad realized volatility. The Clark and West, Journal of Econometrics, 2007, 138, 291–311 forecast evaluation approach is employed to evaluate the forecast performance of the proposed predictive model vis-à-vis the conventional HAR and threshold HAR (T-HAR) models. We find evidence in favour of the MAT-HAR model relative to the HAR and T-HAR models. Also observed is the significant role of asymmetry in modelling the realized volatility as good realized volatility and bad realized volatility yield dissimilar predictability results.

Present study is an applied research, which was based on structural equation modelling in terms of the method of analysis. Statistical population was villagers of Nahgadeh County (N = 12,155) that was estimated using Krejcie and Morgan sampling table (n = 375). The samples were selected using stratified random sampling method. Research tool was a structured questionnaire which its validity confirmed by a panel of experts. Furthermore, the reliability of the research instrument was accomplished through Cronbach's alpha coefficients (0.86 ≤ α ≤ 0.92). Structural equation modelling was employed in order to test the hypotheses. The results indicated that direct effect of psychological capital on psychological empowerment (t = 3.61, γ = 0.24) was positive and significant. Besides, psychological capital (t = 4.28, γ = 0.28) and psychological empowerment (t = 8.67, γ = 0.59) positively and significantly affected entrepreneurial spirit. The analysis of indirect effects demonstrated that the indirect effect of psychological capital on entrepreneurial spirit was significant (γ = 0.42).

The article is based on the assumption that the bankruptcy filing of the company affects the stock returns of its industry competitors and that the competitive effect dominates. The event study method is employed to assess the effect on the valuation of announcing and non-announcing firms. The empirical study is conducted on the example of stock-listed companies in Poland, where bankruptcy proceedings are not aimed at preserving the firm in distress. Averaged results suggest that the bankruptcy filing has a positive short-term effect on the valuation of industry competitors in the sample, which indicates the competitive effect. However, looking at results broken down by industries there is no robust evidence of the effect.

Trade policy and return on capital: An empirical analysis based on China's antidumping,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089173514&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2181&partnerID=40&md5=40a60d6f60bc0943bcb49e9abf90451a,"This paper examines that how China's antidumping actions against other counties affect the returns to capital of involved industries. Using CSMAR from 1997 to 2015, we estimate the excess returns of a firm's equity by three different methods. Then combining with the Global Antidumping Database, we conduct an empirical analysis. Our empirical results show that China's antidumping investigation in specific industries promotes the return on equity of listed companies in the industry, meaning antidumping has positive impact on returns to capital. Antidumping promotes the marginal and average market value of firms' investment, thus showing excess returns on their equity, and then firms invest. As the investment stock increases, firms tend to be in equilibrium and excess returns fall. Furthermore, this paper conducts a series of heterogeneity analyses from the perspectives of capital intensity, capital specificity, and corporate ownership, and proves that antidumping measures can significantly increase the rate of return on capital in the industries involved. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,China; capital; empirical analysis; industrial investment; stock market; trade policy
"Liquidity, time-varying betas and anomalies: Is the high trading activity enhancing the validity of the CAPM in the UK equity market?",2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090066949&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2136&partnerID=40&md5=d7e5491f3798542e86f247529a9ecc68,"In the last decades, a large number of multifactor assetpricing models have emerged with the aim of correcting the estimated equity risk premiums for some well-documented market anomalies. In any case, recent research on asset pricing shows how the higher liquidity resulting from the globalization of financial markets has significantly reduced returns tied to many strategies based on market anomalies. In this framework, questions arise about the possible renovated validity of classic assetpricing models. On this basis, in this paper we study to what extent the capital assetpricing model (CAPM) has recovered its past explanatory power. Specifically, we propose a time-varying beta CAPM in order to control for the variable nature of beta risk to changes in the market liquidity, using the variation of the Amihud illiquidity measure to account for the degree of trading activity. We test both the time-varying and constant beta models on different sets of anomaly portfolios for the UK equity market, and we compare their performance to that of the Fama–French three- and five-factor models. Additionally, we test the constant beta model on a set of actively managed portfolios, formed according to the variation in market illiquidity in the previous year. Our results show that the pricing errors of the CAPM have significantly decreased with respect to those of previous literature. Furthermore, the time-varying beta model performs similarly to the Fama–French models in most cases. These results are consistent with increased trading activity that reduces arbitrage opportunities and, therefore, enhances market efficiency. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,United Kingdom; capital; financial market; globalization; market system

This not only reflects favourable external conditions but also coincides with a significant decline in long-term inflation expectations in financial markets. It is argued, however, that this market-based measure of inflation expectations actually underestimates the true decline in long-term inflation expectations of price setters. To extract this unobserved wedge between inflation expectations of price setters and financial agents, we estimate a time-varying parameter Phillips curve model for the inflation-targeting period since 2001, adjusting also for an unobserved risk premium in market-based inflation expectations. The empirical results suggest that the expectations wedge was significantly positive until early 2012, after which it starts to gradually decline towards zero. The true decline in long-term inflation expectations of actual price setters is, therefore, much steeper than is captured by the market-based measure and taking this into account results in a stable and plausible specification of the Phillips curve that can explain key features of the recent inflation developments in Iceland. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,Iceland; financial crisis; financial market; inflation; long-term change; model

In addition, using a narrative approach to identify fiscal consolidations, it is seen that private consumption continues to exhibit a non-Keynesian response to tax increases, both in the short and long-run, and ‘other expenditures’ have a recessive impact during ‘normal times’. Furthermore, ‘social benefits’ are more contractionary in consolidations than in both expansions and ‘normal times’. In addition, after the launch of the Economic and Monetary Union, expansionary fiscal consolidations became harder to observe, and ‘other expenditure’ and ‘investment’ lost their non-Keynesian role. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,fiscal policy; monetary union; numerical model; public spending; tax system

This environment puts pressure on insurance firms who generally rely on debt markets to provide returns to fund their future financial obligations and to produce profits for their shareholders. This study examines the impact that the yield curve has on equity returns of Canadian and U.S. insurance companies during the past two decades. Using various measures of the yield curve, U.S. insurers' equity returns tend to have a negative relationship with the yield curve. In the Canadian sample, although the yield curve coefficients are negative and thus directionally align with the U.S. results, there is little statistical significance. Finally, there is additional support for the information diffusion hypothesis and asymmetric impacts of the yield curve on insurers' equity returns. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Canada; United States; equity; financial market; financial system; insurance system; stakeholder

The revealed predictability is also of economic significance, because it enables examining of the performance of portfolios that are constructed on IC_RF-based forecasts of oil volatility. Additionally, IC_RF contains robust predictive power beyond what is embedded in traditional fundamental variables. Further analysis provides solid evidence supporting the superiority of asymmetric and regime change models over linear specifications in forecasting oil realized volatility, and it only provides weak evidence for implied oil volatility. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,capital market; crude oil; forecasting method; oil production; oil supply; oil trade; price determination

In a sample of 17 countries examined, 15 countries exhibited significant breaks in trend function of growth process as per the fit and filter approach. We found total 41 plausible breaks – 19 up breaks and 22 down breaks. Moreover, the spatial distribution of breaks shows that over 68% of the breaks are reported from oil-rich countries while as 31% from non-oil.

Endogenous money supply has demonstrated the fallacy of these assumptions by showing that it is not the deposits that create loans, rather the other way round. Unlike commodity money, modern money is credit, generated by the central and commercial banks in the process of advancing reserves and loans. When this correct version of money and banking is evaluated in the light of the correct understanding of riba, it becomes evident that modern money involves riba and this result is equally valid for Islamic banking. Genuine Islamic monetary and banking systems require commodity money, which may include gold and silver, such that its face value is equal to its intrinsic value and it does not represent credit. Riba is not merely a matter of eliminating the institution of interest from economic system, it is about eliminating credit-based monetary or financial system because credit creation is as much riba as is charging interest. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,banking; capital market; commodity market; credit provision; financial services; financial system; institutional framework; Islamism

However, when the sample is split into companies with high and low FOR, the significantly positive effect of CEO power is evident only in the group with high FOR, thereby suggesting that CEO power works positively on earnings management given high FOR. These results remain qualitatively the same when the composite CEO power is replaced with individual measures of CEO power.

On the transmission mechanism of Asia-Pacific yield curve characteristics,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089784917&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2163&partnerID=40&md5=aafd1cfdebac28665fcd6b7c45a63924,"This study investigates the transmission mechanism of Asia-Pacific sovereign bond yields using a monthly data set, which reaches over the period from January 2003 until December 2017. Sovereign bond yields are decomposed into three latent factors – level, curvature and slope – using the dynamic Nelson–Siegel procedure proposed by Diebold and Li, Journal of Econometrics, 2006, 130(2), 337–364. The yield curve propagation mechanism is examined using the dynamic connectedness framework of Diebold and Yılmaz, Journal of Econometrics, 2012, 182(1), 119–134 and Diebold and Yılmaz, Journal of Econometrics, 2014, 182(1), 119–134 which is based on a time-varying parameter vector auto-regression (TVP-VAR). The results suggest that the net transmitters of shocks are Australia, Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore whereas China, India, Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia have been net receivers of shocks. Across factors, those results are consistent except for the Korean curvature factor. In addition, findings revealed that the highest market interconnectedness can be found in the level factor followed by the slope and the curvature factor. Notably, all dynamic connectedness indices strongly increased during the Global Financial Crisis (2009), which illustrates that the Asia-Pacific monetary policy is interconnected with each other especially during periods of economic unrest. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Asia; Australia; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim; economic instability; financial crisis; financial market; financial system; sovereignty; stock market
Securitization and CDS in U.S. bank lending,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089368124&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2204&partnerID=40&md5=bb47bf276e37fac48328605581cfc2a5,"Using a sample of quarterly observations of U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs), we investigate the effect of securitization and CDS on credit supply. Furthermore, we test the hypothesis that securitization and CDS have a different effect on the U.S. bank's lending. The use of CDS and securitization boosts lending cyclicality, reduces the credit supply and amplifies the cyclicality of bank credit supply, particularly in period of financial stress. Furthermore, the worst effect on U.S. bank lending is caused by the use of CDS. We find empirical evidence of effects of CDS and securitization on the bank lending channel following changes in monetary policy. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,United States; banking; credit provision; lending behavior; monetary policy
Capacity utilization under credit constraints: A firm-level study of Latin American manufacturing,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089393842&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2220&partnerID=40&md5=46cb3fd4b3cf034f0b929f905ea3cf80,"In developing countries, the credit market usually is underdeveloped. Low access to credit affects firms' production decisions and restrains them from optimizing inputs to achieve the maximum output. This article examines the link between credit constraints and capacity utilization and whether it varies across manufacturing subsectors. The sample consists of 4,790 private manufacturing firms in six Latin-American countries. The endogenous switching model is applied to control for endogeneity between credit constraint conditions and capacity utilization and heterogeneity between credit-constrained and credit-unconstrained firms. The counterfactual analysis based on the estimation results suggests that constrained firms would have seen an increase of 26.8% capacity utilization had they not been constrained and unconstrained firms a decrease of 23.7% capacity utilization had they been constrained. Credit constraints generally affect medium-high-tech firms more severely than low-tech firms. The counterfactual analysis further reveals that, for credit-constrained high technology firms, depressed outputs are primarily related to labor productivity rather than capital productivity. © 2020 The Authors.

Asymmetric relationship between interest rates and exchange rates: Evidence from Turkey,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091008032&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2213&partnerID=40&md5=8fae661f49196424d9b6ce7ac31e69da,"This paper deals with the dynamic relationship between the interest rate and exchange rate using the data from the Turkish economy. Macroeconomic variables possess both asymmetric and non-linear features; however, most of the empirical research relating to the dynamics of the exchange rate has been conducted only within a linear framework. Therefore, in this paper, a non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model is used to explore asymmetrical relations in the long-run. The pieces of evidence provided in this article show that an increase in the domestic interest rate has a more robust effect on the exchange rate compared to a decrease of the interest rate. The results further indicate that the impact of the domestic interest rate in the short-run is different from their long-run effects. The linear models which neglect asymmetric relation can yield misleading results by showing no relationship between the two variables in the long-run. This paper shows that there is a robust and stable but asymmetric relationship between the interest rate and exchange rate in the long-run. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Turkey; exchange rate; interest rate; macroeconomics

Although slope-based asymmetry tests deriving from non-linear VAR model of Kilian and Vigfusson suggest that the effects on oil production and oil prices are symmetric, the directions and the magnitude of the impulse response functions (IRFs) of TVP-SVAR models did not confirm the relevant relationship. More specifically, it was revealed that the rise/fall of the GPR of Brazil, Russia and India can lead to increasing/decreasing oil prices. While our findings imply that changes in oil prices may not be a factor affecting the oil production through the changes in GPR, we stress that the increase/decrease of GPRs affect the future economic expectations negatively/positively which in turn leads to a change in the oil production. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Brazil; India; Russian Federation; crude oil; future prospect; geopolitics; oil production; price dynamics

This paper investigated the impact of economic development, fossil fuel consumptions and population density on CO2 in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh using annual data over the period 1971–2014. We have applied panel Autoregressive distributed lags model to estimate the long-run dynamics and Vector error correction model specified Granger causality test for finding the causality direction. Using three multivariate equations model, the empirical outcome of our study has established key associations that have crucial policy implications. Firstly, the results of auto-regressive distributed lags (ARDL) confirmed the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis that the relationship between CO2 and economic development is U-shaped. Moreover, fossil fuel consumption and population density have a positive impact on CO2 emission in the long run. VECM test evidence suggests that short-run causalities from economic development to CO2, population density to CO2 and fossil fuel consumption to CO2 exist. Secondly, CO2 has a negative impact on economic development while the impacts of fossil fuel, FDI and total exports on economic development have been significantly positive in the long run. In short run, CO2, fossil fuel consumption and FDI Granger cause economic development. Lastly, CO2 emission negatively influences population density while economic development positively affects population density in long run. Moreover, short-run causalities from economic development to population density and CO2 to population density exit. For policy drives, efficient and low carbon emission technologies should be used. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,Bangladesh; India; Pakistan; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; economic development; fossil fuel; fuel consumption; Granger causality test; Kuznets curve; population density
Environmental regulations and inward FDI in China: Fresh evidence from the asymmetric autoregressive distributed lag approach,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090086905&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2218&partnerID=40&md5=abddd462f268e46829c6fc2a4b1d4118,"The relationship between environmental regulations and foreign direct investment (FDI) has garnered extensive attention, particularly in the context of China. The puzzle of whether environmental regulations deter or lure FDI has not resolved to the satisfaction of the curious mind. This research endeavor is to answer the question by exploring the asymmetric association between environmental regulations and FDI in China; utilizing a novel nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) approach. Our main results affirm that environmental regulations and FDI move together in the long-run, and there is dependable evidence of asymmetry. We notice that FDI inflows react differently in response to positive and negative shocks of environmental regulations both in the long- and short-run. The findings of our study corroborate both the “Pollution Haven” and the “Pollution Halo” hypotheses in China. The Chinese policymakers should strike a balance between environmental stringency and leniency pertaining to inbound FDI for sustainable economic growth—concurrently keeping environmental issues at bay. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,China; asymmetry; econometrics; economic growth; environmental issue; foreign direct investment

Effects of diamond price volatility on stock returns: Evidence from a developing economy,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089652199&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2198&partnerID=40&md5=f7452a85196f565b4294ff5b4aed6d0f,"High diamond price volatility can have significant impact on Botswana's diamond-driven economy. The global economic crisis of 2008–2009 saw the local economy characterised by heightened commodity price uncertainty, falling stock prices and dwindling international demand for diamonds. In this paper we employ a number of techniques to analyse and assess the effect of diamond price volatility on stock returns in Botswana. Firstly, estimation of a Markov Switching model reveals that high volatility regimes in diamond prices have become more frequent and persistent since the recession. Secondly, a bivariate GARCH-in-Mean VAR model is estimated and the results recognize that diamond price volatility has a positive and significant influence on stock returns in Botswana. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,Botswana; commodity price; developing world; diamond; financial crisis; global economy; price dynamics; stock market

On the persistence of UK inflation: A long-range dependence approach,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088937962&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2161&partnerID=40&md5=51fee29e63765c8efbd1779ec4919322,"This paper examines the degree of persistence in UK inflation by applying long-memory methods to historical data that span the period from 1660 to 2016. Specifically, we use both parametric and non-parametric fractional integration techniques, that are more general than those based on the classical I(0) vs. I(1) dichotomy. Further, we carry out break tests to detect any shifts in the degree of persistence, and also run rolling-window and recursive regressions to investigate its evolution over time. On the whole, the evidence suggests that the degree of persistence of UK inflation has been relatively stable following the Bretton Woods period, despite the adoption of different monetary regimes. The estimation of an unobserved-components stochastic volatility model sheds further light on the issues of interest by showing that post-Bretton Woods changes in UK inflation are attributable to a fall in the volatility of permanent shocks. The same type of analysis carried out for US inflation, for comparison purposes, leads to broadly similar conclusions. © 2020 The Authors.

The new strategy generates twice the monthly returns earned by either the price momentum or investment strategy (1.44% vs. 0.75% or 0.61%). Despite the diminishing anomalies in recent decades, the investment-momentum stays persistent. The mispricing-based strategy performs better in periods of high investor sentiment or for stocks with high limits-to-arbitrage, which is consistent with our expectations. Overall, we show that one can simultaneously use multiple dimensions of market inefficiency to attain superior performance. © 2020 The Authors.

We also find that the effect of FV on income inequality is significantly positive, but this harmful effect decreases when the development of the financial system increases further. When the cross-country heterogeneity is considered, the results indicate that it is possible to improve income distribution through a combination of foreign and domestic funds for non-high income and non-lending countries. For those of non-income and counties with low FDI levels, they should focus more on strengthening financial development. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,capital flow; capital market; financial system; foreign direct investment; income distribution; regression analysis
Islamic portfolio optimization under systemic risk: Vine Copula-CoVaR based model,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089450160&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2217&partnerID=40&md5=b1321acde215e27da1c27ba3ff0fbc08,"We propose a new methodology based on CoVaR to optimize Islamic portfolio. First, we generate the return distribution using the ARMA-FIAPARCH and ARMA-FIGARCH model. Then, we transform the standardized residuals onto copula scale using the empirical cumulative distribution function. Thereafter, using the best vine-copula fits, we computed downside and upside risk. We obtained CoVaR of the market (sectors), conditional on the VaR for sectors (market) returns. We find the optimized portfolio wt through mean-CoVaR optimization. The empirical results of Islamic industry show that the optimal allocation is influenced by the existence of systemic risk. Thus, when comparing the mean-CoVaR model with the mean–Variance model we find that mean-CoVaR more performant in optimization. The minimum risk portfolio allocation is influenced by the existence of systemic risk, the interdependence structure between sectors and the optimization model. Our findings offer a better understanding of the allocation during the crisis period which is very valuable for the international investors, multinational corporations and portfolio managers. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,capital market; corporate strategy; industrial enterprise; investment; Islamism; optimization; standardization

The RMB bubbles occurred more in domestic financial crisis, while the HKD bubbles occurred in both domestic and international financial crisis; (III) there are interactions between bubbles in the RMB and HKD. Specifically, the bubbles in the nominal exchange rates of the RMB and HKD are reinforcing each other while the bubbles in the real exchange rates markets are mutually hedging; the nominal and real exchange rate market are mutually reinforcing regardless of the RMB or HKD. Furthermore, the strength of interactions between the RMB and HKD shows that the price of the HKD is more stable than that of the RMB. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,China; Hong Kong; exchange rate; financial crisis; market system

We find that the null-hypothesis (i.e., aggregate insider trading is not related to future stock market returns and thus corporate insiders cannot forecast economy-wide trends) cannot be unanimously rejected for all 32 countries in the sample. Aggregate insider trading in the United States, Asia, China, Hong Kong, and India is coherently positively associated with future market returns according to two aggregate insider sentiment indicators. For Switzerland, Sweden, Poland, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines we further find limited evidence indicating a positive association between aggregate insider trading and future index returns.

Given the growing body of literature on this topic, this paper aims to provide a structured review of literature on the determinants of NPLs with a focus on the current dynamics of the field. This study discusses the main theories that shaped the debate on NPLs and their bank-specific, macroeconomic and industry-related determinants. A thorough understanding of these latter would enable policymakers, regulators and bank managers to anticipate banks' failures and, academicians to advance their research. To facilitate further knowledge in this field, this paper reviews 69 studies published between 1987 and 2019 in 40 peer-reviewed journals. We argue that despite the extensive empirical and theoretical work accomplished over the last decades, the issue of credit risk remains an unsolved line of inquiry, which leaves ample room for critical debates. Beside mapping the emerging discourse on this area, this study proposes a promising future research agenda to guide research advancement. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,banking; capital market; credit provision; financial services; literature review; policy making; research work

The results from 802 companies selected from member countries of APTA indicated that, in all countries except Bangladesh, the earning management is not performed for improving earning informativeness in market and rather it is done for achieving manager's personal benefit. The specific behaviour is seen in India and Sri Lanka in which the higher accrual quality reduces the pricing of earning in market. This behaviour is due to the fact that investors are uninformed. Moreover, this behaviour is due to information asymmetry. The earning quality also has negative influence on earning informativeness towards market value in case of India and Bangladesh, which suggest that overstatement of beginning net operating assets have negative effect on earning information content as this overstatement reduces returns on asset due to overstated denominator, rather it restricts managers from biased earnings. However, in other countries it works in a way suggested by Barton and Simko (2002). The market value measure of India has greater dependency on interaction term as compared to China and Pakistan due to lower price synchronicity. China also has greater influence of interaction term on its company's market values than Pakistan. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Bangladesh; China; India; Pakistan; Sri Lanka; asymmetry; price dynamics; qualitative analysis; quality control; trade agreement

Predicting the volatility of crude oil futures: The roles of leverage effects and structural changes,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089897303&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2171&partnerID=40&md5=5e783acd11c3dff1d2cd93299bc0e046,"This paper investigates whether leverage effects and structural changes have positive effects on the volatility prediction of crude oil futures. On the basis of existing HAR models, this paper proposes three classes of new HAR models by considering leverage effects, structural changes, or both. The in-sample and out-of-sample results show that leverage effects and structural changes contain significant information for predicting oil volatility. In most cases, structural changes have more in-sample and out-of-sample incremental information than leverage effect, whereas leverage effects have more out-of-sample information for predicting 1-day volatility. In addition, HAR models with leverage effects and structural changes have better in-sample and out-of-sample performances than the corresponding other three classes of HAR models. The above results mean that leverage effects and structural changes should be considered while modelling and forecasting oil volatility. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,crude oil; future prospect; model; prediction; structural change
Financial inclusion and bank profitability in Sub-Saharan Africa,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089298198&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2135&partnerID=40&md5=4366c81f3a0e86d6c5b9b5795dbbfb11,This paper investigates the impact of financial inclusion on banks' profitability in Sub-Saharan Africa. The paper employed the system generalized method of moments (GMM) dynamic pooled estimator for the computation of the parameters using data spanning from 1990 to 2017. The results show that there is an affirmative relationship between financial inclusion index (FINDEX) and bank profitability in Sub-Saharan Africa. This suggests that financial inclusion is a significant driver of banks' profitability in Sub-Saharan Africa. The policy implication of this study is that for banks in Sub-Saharan African countries to increase their profitability and get optimum results from financial inclusion they must formulate policies aimed at promoting financial inclusion. This suggests that banks in Sub-Saharan African countries must be creative and innovative in pursuing financial inclusion policies. Such policies should be targeted at increasing the number of bank branches and ATMs. Banks should also make effort at finding ways of making opening of bank accounts much easier for the vulnerable and marginalized in society by relaxing the requirements for customer identification in specific situations where they may hamper financial inclusion goals and efforts. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd,,Sub-Saharan Africa; banking; finance; financial policy; innovation; profitability
The Oil Price-Macroeconomic fundamentals nexus for emerging market economies: Evidence from a wavelet analysis,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089886206&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2231&partnerID=40&md5=a307ef025c57fc4e1fc4d411ad4ee9b4,"This study uses the (partial) cross wavelet analysis and the phase difference to decompose the time frequency effects of oil prices on major aggregate macroeconomic fundamentals (real effective exchange rate index, interest rate yield spread and stock market index) of emerging market economies, aiming to discern the direction of the lead–lag relationship between these variables at different time scales over the period December 1987 to April 2017. Our results suggest that there is a strong coherence between oil prices and the individual components of the macroeconomic fundamentals at higher frequencies (0–1 years) in those economies. The phase difference analysis shows that the variables move within the phase for the widths of higher frequency bands (1–2 and 2–4 years), but it is difficult to ascertain the leading/lagging variables. As a robustness check, the results of the conditional analysis extend the significance of the coherency to 1–2 years. However, the phase difference of the robustness check indicates that oil prices and the macroeconomic fundamentals only move within the phase at lower frequency band widths (4–8 and 8–16 years). The existence of the time-varying comovement between the oil price and the aggregate macroeconomic fundamentals across heterogeneous time frequencies indicates that investors making decisions about their portfolio compositions and policy makers adjusting various economic stabilization schemes for greater stability should take account of varying frequency bands. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,decomposition analysis; interest rate; macroeconomics; market conditions; oil supply; price dynamics; real exchange rate; stock market; wavelet analysis
Modelling opportunity cost effects in money demand due to openness,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088783875&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2175&partnerID=40&md5=ad27c185c5279703b15a3ca1ebc4787f,"We apply a novel model-based approach to constructing composite international financial indices (CIFIs) as measures of opportunity cost effects that arise due to openness in money demand models. These indices are tested on the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan Province of China (TPC), two economies which differ substantially in size and degree of financial openness. Results show that (a) stable money demand equations can be identified if accounting for foreign opportunity costs through CIFIs, (b) the monetary policy intervention in the PRC over the global financial crisis period temporarily mitigated disequilibrating foreign shocks to money demand, (c) CIFIs capture opportunity costs due to openness more adequately than commonly used US interest rates and (d) CIFI construction provides valuable insights into the channels through which foreign financial markets affect domestic money demand. © 2020 The Authors.

Oil price uncertainty and the risk-return relation in stock markets: Evidence from oil-importing and oil-exporting countries,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089479005&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2206&partnerID=40&md5=1cf97751184e0a16c1c3cab7af81d0b6,"This article examines the role of oil price uncertainty measured by the crude oil volatility index (OVX) in the risk-return relation of stock markets from oil-importing and exporting countries with the extended GARCH-M models. It is found that oil price uncertainties have significant impacts on the stock risk-return relationship in oil importers and exporters. Specifically, there is a positive risk-return relation during the decreasing period of oil price uncertainty. This positive correlation will be undermined and become negative during the rising period of oil price uncertainty in most countries studied. What's more, change in oil price uncertainty negatively affects the stock risk-return relation in general, and it has a more significant asymmetric effect in oil exporters than that in oil importers for the whole sample. In addition, we examine whether the impact of oil price uncertainty is sensitive to the global financial crisis in 2008. Our empirical results reveal that, on average, the stock risk-return relation is more susceptible to OVX changes after the crisis period than that during the crisis period, suggesting impacts of OVX changes are undermined due to the extremely unstable global economy. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,crude oil; energy market; export; financial crisis; global economy; import; oil supply; price dynamics; stock market; uncertainty analysis

Over the course of many studies, bilateral FPI appears to increase with an increase in the correlation between the gross domestic product growth rates of the sender and the receiver. The Capital Asset Pricing Model in financial theory predicts the opposite—and this is known as the correlation puzzle. One possible explanation is that the correlation is a proxy for both diversification benefits and informational asymmetry. Using seven cross-sections of bilateral FPI holdings data from the CEPII Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey for the years 2000–2006, we attempt to explain the correlation puzzle by augmenting the gravity model with random effects to account for heterogeneity in propensity to send and receive investments and with latent space position models to account for effects of unobserved country attributes, as well as transitivity, clustering, and balance in order to capture the information asymmetry and leave the correlation coefficient as a measure of the diversification benefit. We use maximum likelihood Heckman sample selection estimators to account for potential bias in estimators that can be caused by frequent zeros in our data, describing a model for the presence or absence of FPI between the two countries and a model for the level of FPI between two countries conditional on its presence. We find that if there is a presence of FPI between country s and country r, then as the correlation between the economic growth of these countries increases, the level of investment will decrease. However, this correlation has no significant impact on the decision of country s to invest in country r. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,asymmetric information; capital provision; correlation; economic growth; foreign direct investment; Gross Domestic Product; heterogeneity; maximum likelihood analysis; network analysis; numerical model; social network
Conditions for the success of capital controls: The elasticity approach,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089863968&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2182&partnerID=40&md5=379db30ed67f7155ea82df99eea533c1,"Capital controls are a commonly used instrument to manage capital flows. However, their effectiveness in reducing short-term capital flows is still unclear. The present study proposes a new approach to the evaluation of the effects of capital controls, by proposing a model in which these effects depends on the elasticity of short-term capital flows relative to total flows. When capital controls are in place, achieving an elastic demand reduces these short-term flows, while an inelastic demand may increase them. The proposition of the model is empirically verified by computing the elasticity approach for 33 countries. This approach suggests that policymakers take proactive actions against the fickleness of short-term capital flows. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,capital flow; demand elasticity; policy making
A new risk measurement method for China's carbon market,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089467157&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2214&partnerID=40&md5=f43d4245a822aaebd7ddae14b274a6fb,"Carbon markets were set up with the aim to achieve carbon reduction target and sustainable development. However, market risk has become one of the key factors influencing continuous development of carbon markets. Different from traditional financial asset price, carbon price has a heterogeneous characteristic in its tail distribution. The current value at risk (VaR) model with student t or generalized error distribution (GED) cannot describe the asymmetric tail distribution of carbon price. Therefore, this article propose to develop a combined model for China's carbon market risk measurement. First, extend generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) with standardized standard asymmetric exponential power distribution (SSAEPD) to reflect volatility clustering phenomenon and heterogeneous distribution character of China's carbon price. Then, genetic algorithm (GA) was innovatively used to solve GARCH-SSAEPD linear programming instead of interior-point algorithm. Finally, use VaR to measure the carbon market risk. The new model (GARCH-SSAEPD-GA-VaR) is implied to China's carbon market and compared with the traditional GARCH-VaR model, the empirical results show: (a) Compared with current VaR framework, the GARCH-SSAEPD-GA-VaR model we constructed can help describe the heterogeneous tail distribution of carbon price and help increase the precision of carbon market risk measurement. (b) SSAEPD can capture fat-tail, asymmetric effects of China's carbon price more entirely, which puts forward a new method to study the evolvement laws of carbon market risk. (c) GA is effective to achieve global optimum to some extent in parameter estimation. This study contribute to developing theory and methodology of describing particularity features of carbon price, increasing the accuracy of carbon market risk measurement and provide a new perspective for investigating the evolvement regularity of China's carbon market risks. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,China; carbon emission; emission control; genetic algorithm; measurement method; price determination; risk assessment; sustainable development
Impacts of geopolitical risks and economic policy uncertainty on Chinese tourism-listed company stock,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089913769&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2155&partnerID=40&md5=14bc94a2d9110d83d58d995ab3e0fe40,"This paper investigates how geopolitical risk (GPR) and economic policy uncertainty (EPU) impact the Chinese tourism stock return using the quantile-on-quantile method and causality-in-quantiles approach. Compared to the conventional linear regression model and the quantile regression, the quantile-on-quantile method can capture more factors of uncertainty and provide more accurate and detailed empirical results. Besides, we consider the upper quantile and lower quantile of stock return as the tourism peak season and off-season respectively. Overall, the empirical results indicate GPR exerts a lasting negative effect on tourism stock return and that the negative effect of GPR at low quantile is more significant than that at high quantile. Besides, the Chinese categorical EPU influences both negatively and positively the stock returns at different distribution levels. And during tourist off-season, the asymmetric phenomena between GPR, EPU and stock return are more obvious at lower quantiles and upper quantiles. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,China; comparative study; economic impact; economic policy; geopolitics; regression analysis; tourism economics; tourism market; uncertainty analysis

Nonetheless, after global financial crisis and fall of Bretton wood system a new debate was generated to re-examine the issue after the implementation of financial liberalization policies in different economies. Therefore the present research focuses on examining the predominant determinants of industrial developments for a sample of developed economies and check the comparison between European Union (27 Countries) and United Kingdom. The explicit aim of the present research is to investigate the association between capital account openness (CAO), trade openness (TO), equity openness (EO) and industrial development (IDV) for economies of Europe (EU without UK) and United Kingdom (UK). Time series data set over 1986 to 2017 was employed for empirical analysis. Industrial development was measured by industry value added; KAOPEN as a measure of CAO, TO measured by the ratio of the sum of imports and exports relative to GDP and EO measured by market capitalization divided by GDP. The data sources predominantly included International Financial Statistics and World Development Indicators. Stationarity of data was measured through augmented Dickey–Fuller test, OLS regression was used to examine the association and percentage variation between the study variables. Findings reported only EO and TO as significant predictor of industry development in case of EU. However, EO, TO and CAO does not contribute as a significant determinant in case of United Kingdom. Lastly, the study also explains tremors, subsequent effects and magnitudes, intra- and inter-reliance of constructs under consideration by employing vector auto-regression (VAR), impulse response function and variance decomposition. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,Europe; United Kingdom; capital market; economic growth; European Union; financial market; Gross Domestic Product; industrial development; industrial investment; poverty alleviation; regional economy
Outward foreign direct investment and economic growth in Romania: Evidence from non-linear ARDL approach,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089861560&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2173&partnerID=40&md5=f74a46e2eebc37ef69e6ad685c214a41,"Globally, the outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) has significantly increased during recent years. In the light of OFDI's role in determining the GDP growth rate, it is necessary to assess how economic growth rate responds to such outflows. Based on the non-linear autoregressive distributive lag (NARDL) model, the present study investigates the long-run and short-run asymmetric impacts of OFDI on the economic growth in Romania covering the period 1990–2019. The results indicate that both an increase and a decrease in OFDI have a positive and significant impact on Romania's economic growth, with a greater effect arising from the increase in OFDI. Our research adds to the preceding literature by providing new insights into the OFDI-led growth hypothesis. The results of the present study portray the growth-enhancing effects of OFDI, which are consistent with the notion that firms conduct OFDI in order to combine domestic output with overseas output to decrease expenditures and to enhance their competitiveness both at global and domestic levels. Thus, an increase in OFDI is both a cause and a consequence of the home country's economic growth. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Romania; competitiveness; economic growth; expenditure; foreign direct investment; Gross Domestic Product; growth rate; nonlinearity; numerical model

Governor removals are decomposed into premature removals and ally replacements. Our results show that commodity price shocks lead to a statistically significant increase in the probability of a central bank governor's premature removal and ally replacement. This trend holds when commodities price shocks are separated into oil/mineral shocks and agricultural commodities shocks. We also find that this probability significantly jumps for countries who have a lower degree of export diversification, that is, countries whose are primarily dependent on a single commodity. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Africa; banking; central bank; commodity market; commodity price; consumption behavior; governance approach

Employing a large dataset of 44 countries from 2001 to 2015 and three different measures of corruption, our results show that foreign investors from well-governed countries tend to foster public accountability, reduce asymmetry information and corruption. We find empirical evidence that foreign equity portfolio investment interacts with stock market development and central bank transparency to reduce corruption. Our results suggest that stock market development and central bank transparency are regarded as complementary by international portfolio investors. Further analysis indicates that corruption appears more prevalent in countries where domestic investors dominate the stock market. Our results are robust to endogeneity using dynamic generalized methods of moments (GMM). The findings suggest that attracting foreign equity investors reduces corruption, implying significant benefits for portfolio diversification. © 2020 The Authors.

Comparisons of deposit types and implications of the financial crisis: Evidence for U.S. banks,2022,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088835861&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2172&partnerID=40&md5=03d0e461e0d1523daf13bdbc3f48ce93,"This paper makes three diverse contributions. First, whereas the extant literature estimates a single elasticity of substitution/complementarity from an input distance function, we calculate a range of elasticities. Second, we make a substantive contribution to the literature on bank input substitution/complementarity because somewhat surprisingly there has been very little work on this issue. Third, our analysis of the substitutability/complementarity of deposit types for U.S. banks in 2008–2015 (crisis and beyond), vis-à-vis 1992–2007 (pre-crisis), is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to consider the effect of structural change on elasticities of substitution/complementarity. To account for the extent of the heterogeneity in the U.S. banking industry we estimate random coefficients models, as opposed to standard fixed parameter models. The key empirical findings are the changes in the substitutability/complementarity of the quantities of particular pairs of deposit types between the two sample periods, which points to changes in depositors' preferences across banks' deposit portfolios. To illustrate, for savings deposits, which are characterized by flexibility and liquidity, and time deposits, which are less so and thus have higher interest rates, we find significantly lower quantity complementarity in 2008–2015. From this finding, we can conclude that savings and time deposits have become more distinct, which we suggest should be reflected in banks' strategic management of their deposit portfolios. © 2020 The Authors.

We show that financial and economic development, institutions and macroeconomic stability are the fundamental variables that moderate the finance-growth nexus. Specifically, higher levels of financial and economic development, institutional quality and macroeconomic stability promote the impact of financial development on economic growth, while lower levels of these variables could have the opposite effect. We also show that too much finance is deleterious to economic growth, suggesting the existence of a threshold level of financial development beyond which further finance inhibits, rather than enhances growth. The economic implication of this study is that a stable macroeconomic environment, higher level of institutional quality, optimum financial and economic development are necessary conditions for finance to accelerate growth. Hence, countries that want to promote economic growth through the financial sector should give adequate priority to these variables. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",economic development; economic growth; financial development; institutions; macroeconomic stability,economic development; economic growth; financial market; financial services; financial system; macroeconomics

In this context, apart from standard forecasting models like AR (p) and ARDL (p, q) we estimate a novel Neural Network ARDL (p, q, G) model and its respective Bayesian modification. We show that extending standard autoregressive models with the information provided by Internet Searches leads to significant improvement in the forecasting accuracy of the Bank Deposits, compared with other standard models. Furthermore, the forecasting performance of the models, which are extended with Google searches, is shown to be better than models containing only the well-known indicators.

Since our results provide empirical evidence that the board of directors plays a vital role in mitigating EM, these findings might lead to an improvement in the credibility of financial statements for investors in both the UK and Egypt.

We apply the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model of Shin et al., (2014). Our findings confirm co-integration between IBD and EG in Pakistan. The positive (negative) shocks of IBD have significant positive (negative) association with EG in the long-run; however, only positive shocks have significant positive relationship with EG in the short run. We observe that the interconnection between IBD-EG is asymmetric/non-linear in the long-run, whereas symmetric/linear in the short run. We conclude that unlike the linear models, the non-linear models provide realistic results by capturing hidden asymmetries, thereby assisting policymakers in useful decision making. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",asymmetric co-integration; economic growth; Islamic banking development; NARDL; Pakistan,Pakistan; asymmetry; banking; decision making; economic development; economic growth; nonlinearity
Financial rigidities and oil-based business cycles,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089510071&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2060&partnerID=40&md5=71c37b57de6344c79350018019a84c59,"The structural model of this paper incorporates a heterogeneous financial sector and an oil fund into a micro-founded new Keynesian framework. We take a novel approach in introducing an oil fund into the model. This approach features a rule-based budget financing, linkages between the oil and financial sectors and a saving mechanism for future generations. The primary goal is to examine the role of financial and non-financial rigidities in an oil-exporting economy. We show that financial rigidities are key in propagating shocks across sectors by differentiating interest rates in the economy. In addition, the financial sector transfers shocks from one sector to another through its intermediary role. We find that the oil fund plays a key role in the stabilization/propagation of oil price fluctuations through the saving-liquidity transfer channel used by the central bank. These channels connect and amplify business and financial cycles in oil-exporting economies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",financial rigidity; inter-bank market; oil fund; price stickiness,banking; business cycle; financial market; interest rate; Keynesian theory; oil industry; price dynamics
Does trade openness and FDI reduce inequality?

The analysis of the model involves the examination of likely non-linear effect of both trade and FDI on income distribution. Therefore, dynamic panel system-generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) estimator has been applied to mitigate the problem of non-linearity and possible endogeneity. In the second stage, the model is extended to test the impact of education on income inequality. The hypothesis was that secondary school enrolment speeds up the process of adoption of contemporary technology and decreases inequality. The results reveal that trade and FDI have significant effects on income inequality, however, inverted U-shaped curve holds for trade as purposed by the trade theory. The component wise effect of trade was also held, except imports from advanced countries. The joint effect of trade and FDI through education has produced mixed results. South Asia needs to invest in social infrastructure and swifter the process of openness to achieve the desired goal of equitable prosperity. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",FDI; income inequality; regression; South Asia; trade,South Asia; foreign direct investment; impact; income distribution; regression analysis; socioeconomic impact; technology adoption; trade openness

The Feldstein–Horioka hypothesis for African countries: Evidence from recent panel error-correction modelling,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092158384&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2092&partnerID=40&md5=ea732b0bfe8dc8f70337b681c2880ada,"This paper, by applying the recent panel data error-correction modelling developed by Gengenbach et al., Panel error correction testing with global stochastic trends, 2008 University of Maastricht, Working Paper, RM/08/051:1–51 and Gengenbach et al., Journal of Applied Econometrics, 2016, 31, 982–1004 tests the validity of the Feldstein–Horioka puzzle (1980) in a panel of 27 African countries for the period 1965–2015. Unlike the existing studies in the literature, this paper, for the first time, addresses several important panel data econometric issues such as slope heterogeneity, cross-section dependence, unobservable common factors, non-stationarity and endogeneity that would yield inconsistent and biased estimates of the parameters of interest. Unlike the previous residual-based error-correction modelling that has low power, the Gengenbach et al., Panel error correction testing with global stochastic trends, 2008, University of Maastricht, Working Paper, RM/08/051:1–51 and Gengenbach et al., Journal of Applied Econometrics, 2016, 31, 982–1004 estimator explicitly considers structural dynamics in modelling a cointegrated panel that allows for the presence of non-stationary unobserved common factors. As the GUW modelling depends on the Pesaran Common Correlated Effects Mean Group Estimator (CCEMG; 2006) and the Chudik and Pesaran Dynamic Common Correlated Effects Mean Group Estimator (DCCEMG; 2015), we report the results based on these estimators. The econometric exercises performed in the paper show that slope heterogeneity; cross-section dependence and non-stationarity are present in the panel data sample used in the estimation. Estimations yield a relatively low magnitude of the savings retention coefficient for the panel members included in the study with a negative error-correction term that is statistically significant at the individual and panel levels.

Surprisingly, such numbers are compatible with investors' risk aversions that accommodate the very different U.S. market evidence, exposing that national investors are similar in nature. The equity premium has been higher in Brazil than in the U.S., but the much higher Brazilian volatility discourages heavier investments in stocks. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",emerging market; equity returns; equity risk premium; lifetime portfolio selection,Brazil; United States; Matthiola; equity; financial market; investment; risk assessment; stock market

We explore the dynamic relationship between the oil market and motor fuel market (both gasoline and diesel) by focusing on the effects of oil demand and refinery shocks on motor fuel price and consumption. The results reveal opposite responses of gasoline and diesel consumption to positive oil demand shocks. Moreover, motor fuel price response to both oil demand and refinery shocks is greater than that of motor fuel consumption. We also assess the immediate and long-run contributions of each of the shocks to the total variation of motor fuel price and consumption in the Swedish motor fuel market. © 2021 The Authors.

Based on a review of the advantages and disadvantages of different volatility models, we find that the Heston stochastic volatility model with an adaptive correlation coefficient is most suitable for analysing the Hong Kong options market. We subsequently propose a model-free implied volatility term structure formulated using options with different strikes and different maturities. The implied volatility is calculated by integrating the option price and strike price from the current time to the expiry date. Discrete points of term structure data are used to fit a term structure curve. Finally, we use the model-free implied volatility term structure as the long-run mean level of the Heston model to fully exploit the information content contained in the implied volatility term structure. We simulate the distribution of the underlying asset price based on the Heston model and constant elasticity of variance (CEV) model. The adaptive correlation Heston model provides superior results in terms of one-day-ahead prediction performance and the 79-day distribution of the underlying asset price compared with the CEV model. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",implied volatility; stochastic volatility model; term structure,China; Hong Kong; correlation; numerical model; price determination; stochasticity; trend analysis; variance analysis

In a second step, we model the investment decision problem of households to illustrate through which channel the use of DLTs impacts the household's behaviour. Our model captures the return–risk trade-off between two forms of investments for households with different risk preferences. It reveals that the use of DLTs can mitigate the associated risk of an investment in a HIT fund causing more risk-averse households to change their investment behaviour. Although our theoretical analysis ascertains the potentials of DLTs to enhance social funding schemes, it also works out challenges for the establishment of DLT based funds. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",crowdfunding; distributed ledger technologies; green finance; hometown investment trust funds; small-scale energy projects; social funding,environmental economics; financial system; green economy; information technology; investment; risk assessment; theoretical study; trade-off

(a) There is a significant information spillover effect between China's real estate markets and related stock markets, and China's real estate is in a net information receiving position. (b) After 2016, China's real estate financial risks entered a downward adjustment cycle, and financial risks have gradually declined. These results suggest that Chinese real estate markets' “de-inventory” has achieved remarkable results and that real estate financial risks have been significantly reduced.

I adopt alternative variables as a policy instrument. When the spread is used as a policy instrument, I find that contractionary monetary policy has a significant negative effect on both output and the price level, and it appreciates the Turkish Lira. Besides, the tight monetary policy reduces both aggregate and sectoral market returns. Hence, I observe that there are effective interest rate, exchange rate, and asset price channels in the Turkish economy. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",exchange rate; financial markets; monetary policy; transmission channels,Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo; empirical analysis; exchange rate; financial market; monetary policy; stock market

Panel regression results reveal significant effect of CEO incentives and analysts' characteristics on the forecast accuracy of the latter. The reported results suggest that CEO incentives driven by high compensation, restricted stock holdings and stock ownership can correct analysts' optimism, whereas CEO bonus and sensitivity to changes in firm's value exacerbate analysts' optimism. We further examine how CEO incentives affect the impact of earnings management on analysts' forecasts. Results show that CEO incentives can augment the effect of earnings management on analysts' forecasts with CEO bonus being the most deteriorating factor. Our findings also indicate that experienced analysts are more optimistic in their forecasts, while higher forecast frequency can correct this optimism.

For this purpose, a panel cointegration framework that allows to control for parameters heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence and non-stationarity has been deployed. Empirical results yield evidence of a positive and significant effect of export upgrading on economic growth for the full-sample and high-income panels, while this effect is negative and significant for low-income countries and insignificant for middle-income countries. Particularly, our findings show evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship for the global and high-income panels. However, for low-income countries relationship between export complexity and economic growth was found to be U-shaped. These results are robust to several robustness checks and have important policy implications. In developed countries, excessive export complexity may be job-destructive, and thereby threatens long-run growth and prosperity. For non-developed countries, exports' diversification should be prioritized during the first stages of development. Industrial upgrading should not be considered as a strategic economic policy before the economy reaches a minimum level of maturity. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",CCEMG technique; cross-sectional dependence; economic growth; export upgrading; panel cointegration,cointegration analysis; economic growth; economic policy; empirical analysis; export; panel data

Islamic home financing is one such mode of financing which is based on ownership sharing or deferred payment arrangement with the bank, hence avoiding chances of interest and speculation. This study examines the factors that affect customers' decision in selecting Islamic home financing services. A quantitative research methodology was adopted to study the dynamics of Islamic home financing by determining the level of key factors in Pakistani consumer market. Using stratified random sampling technique, data was collected from 250 bank customers through five-point Likert scale questionnaires. Various tests were applied to check the reliability, sampling adequacy and correlation. Multiple regression analysis was applied for hypothesis testing. The findings of the study reveal that the level of knowledge, media advertisement, bank reputation, product choices and Shariah compliance are the key factors for the Pakistani bank customers who selected Islamic home financing. More importantly, we find no significant impact of price and bank services on selection of Islamic home financing. The results of the study enable the Islamic banking professionals and managers to identify the factors that are most valuable to customers for the selection of Islamic home financing over conventional home financing modes. They are suggested to develop strategies and plans to educate people more about Islamic home finance and develop their product portfolio to provide people with more Shariah compliant choices.

Using principal component analysis, we find that bank connections help small business owners improve capital structure efficiency. Connections are also associated with lower interest rates; however, we find that they improve performance primarily through their improvement of capital structure efficiency rather than reduced interest rates. These findings may prove practically useful for business owners, bankers, and other stakeholders by illustrating how effective policies that help link small business owners with bankers can improve firm performance through access to capital and professional advice. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bank connections; capital structure efficiency; cost of debt capital; firm performance; small businesses,Canada; banking; capital; debt; industrial performance; private sector; small and medium-sized enterprise; social capital
Monetary policy news and systemic risk at the zero lower bound,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089391308&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2047&partnerID=40&md5=0555c77efaf636c2b2e7d616cd63f0a1,"This paper employs a recent contribution to the construction of the shadow nominal interest rate during the zero lower bound episode and Greenbook forecasts to obtain a measure of monetary policy shocks over that time period. It then identifies monetary policy news shocks as a novel measure of the forward-looking conduct of monetary policy in the U.S. Using the data from 1987—2010, it shows that neither monetary news nor surprises affected alternative measures of systemic risk over the full sample. However, monetary news shocks announcing future reductions in interest rates were effective in lowering most (but not all) systemic risk measures during the zero lower bound period, unlike monetary surprises. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Greenbook forecasts; monetary policy; news shocks; systemic risk; zero lower bound,United States; financial market; financial system; future prospect; interest rate; monetary policy
Efficiency and productivity analysis of Pakistan's banking industry: A DEA approach,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089466519&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2123&partnerID=40&md5=79a42ae3dda842b05e5c0c599255acf7,"The objective of this study is to investigate operational efficiency, productivity, and associated differences between the operational efficiency and productivity of Pakistan's private, public, and foreign banks over the period 2006–2017. To measure the operational efficiency scores and productivity growth change, we used data envelopment analysis (DEA) and Malmquist productivity index (MPI) simultaneously. Kruskal–Wallis test was used to check the significant differences between the mean technical efficiencies of different commercial banking industries of Pakistan. Empirical results revealed that mean technical and pure technical efficiency scores of foreign banks are better than domestic banks; however, the mean scale efficiency score of domestic banking is relatively better than foreign banks. Further public sector banks performed well than the private banking industry during the period 2006–2017. Kruskal–Wallis test demonstrated a significant difference between the mean technical efficiency scores of three different banking sectors (public, private, and foreign) of the Pakistan commercial banking industry. Moreover, the MPI results indicated that there is (1.9%) decline in mean total factor productivity change for all commercial banks during the sample period. Further, total factor productivity change of foreign commercial banks shows growth, while a decaying trend is observed for domestic commercial banks. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",commercial banks; data envelopment analysis; Kruskal–Wallis test; Malmquist productivity index; Pakistan and technical efficiency,Pakistan; banking; data envelopment analysis; productivity; public sector; technical efficiency
The impact of rent-seeking on economic growth in the six geographic regions: Evidence from static and dynamic panel data analysis,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089664588&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2069&partnerID=40&md5=3d8140f14fb4815e213cc2eab04f63f2,"This paper empirically investigates the impact of rent-seeking on economic growth by introducing an augmented Solow growth model over the period 2010–2015. Static and dynamic panel regression models are employed to investigate this impact for the six geographic regions, namely, Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, and South Asia according to the World Bank's classification. Results reveal that the impact of control for rent-seeking on economic growth is found highly significant and positive for most of the regions however, no significant effect could detect on the control for rent-seeking on economic growth for advanced economies. Results also show that there exists mixed evidence between gross fixed capital as a percentage of gross domestic product, Employment ratio and economic growth for the six geographic regions. The results can be interpreted in favour of the advanced economies that they can relatively handle the rent-seeking problem compared to the relatively weak economies due to much better political and economic stability, better administrative mechanism, stronger law system, more adequate public services, better health, and education system as well as more advanced infrastructure. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",economic growth; rent-seeking; six geographic regions; static and dynamic panel data analysis,Caribbean Islands; Central Asia; Europe; Far East; Latin America; Middle East; North Africa; Pacific Ocean; South Asia; Sub-Saharan Africa; economic growth; employment; geographical region; Gross Domestic Product; panel data; rent seeking; World Bank
The impacts of R&D investment and stock markets on clean-energy consumption and CO2 emissions in OECD economies,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090978678&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2049&partnerID=40&md5=1dbb3f4e732c8982ef6ae6a3e9f5254f,"The goal of this paper is to examine to what extent R&D investment and stock market development promote clean-energy consumption and environmental protection across a panel of 30 OECD economies. Based on the theoretical approach, study employs robust panel econometric models, which account for cross-sectional dependence in the analysis and uses annual data, spanning the period 1996–2013. The empirical results illustrate that R&D and stock market have a significant long-run equilibrium relationship with clean energy and CO2 emissions. The long-run elasticities display that R&D and stock market growth have a significant positive impact on clean-energy consumption, while they have a negative effect on the growth of CO2 emissions. Given these findings, the paper suggests that the policy makers in the OECD economies should realize that it is worth investing in R&D activities as it is promoting the use of clean energy and ensuring low carbon economies. Therefore, the policymakers have to initiate effective policies to promote R&D activities and also encourage the firms that are listed in the stock market to adopt environmental friendly policies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",clean-energy consumption; CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; FDI; OECD economies; R&D investments; stock markets,adaptive management; carbon emission; demand elasticity; energy use; environmental economics; environmental protection; foreign direct investment; OECD; policy making; research and development; stock market

One interesting implication of this conclusion is that the empirical evidence about the stability of market shares implies the optimality of the number of small banks in the loan market; it points to what perfect competition entails in practice insofar as the banking system is concerned. It follows that if the fringe is to serve as a transmission channel of monetary policy, a prudential policy targeting the large bank(s) will also be necessary in order to preserve market structure.

Within this model financial stability and volatility are latent variables. To observe financial stability and volatility we employ Bayesian inference procedures organized around Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) technique and particle filtering. We do so in a single stage that controls also for non-linearities, while we also allow for some key bank and country-specific variables to impact upon financial stability and volatility. Thus, we provide a new measure of financial stability by country, over time and also at a global level. In an empirical application, we derive financial stability indexes for a plethora of countries, as well as the global financial stability index that acts as an early warning index. Our results suggest that the financial cycle is subject to non-linearities. We argue that the global financial system should closely monitor large, systemic, banks as key to support financial stability. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Bayes priors; financial stability; global banking; latent variables; systemic banks,Varanidae; banking; Bayesian analysis; financial market; financial system; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; panel data
The effects of fiscal governance on fiscal performance in Sub-Saharan Africa,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089826014&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2091&partnerID=40&md5=3ee6bc72324829dfebcf66837adc8865,"Fiscal governance implemented around the globe offer useful information on the potential viable reasons for its increasing dependence and their implication for fiscal performance. This paper investigates the effects of fiscal governance in explaining the fiscal performance of countries in Africa. The paper uses a panel data of 43 countries from worldwide databases spanning from 1985 to 2011. The random effects model approach is used to analyse the data based on the diagnostic tests. Additionally, the panel corrected standard errors and Hausmann and Taylor estimation models are used to test the robustness of our results to further correct for possible errors and endogeneity in the regressors. The empirical analysis shows that fiscal policy rules and institutions have statistically significant effect on fiscal performance. The results from all the methods indicate higher coefficients of the expenditure rule relative to the other rules. This trend suggests the suitability of the adoption of the expenditure rule within the Sub-Saharan African environment. This could be partly explained by the fact that, the restrictions placed on expenditures with the aim of controlling excessive spending behaviours of fiscal authorities have been very successful in influencing fiscal deficits in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study contributes to the literature on the implication of the adoption of fiscal governance in African countries. The policy message to stakeholders is that, fiscal governance should be further strengthened to improve fiscal performance. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",corruption; deficit bias; fiscal governance; fiscal performance; public debt,Sub-Saharan Africa; corruption; database; debt; empirical analysis; fiscal policy; governance approach; panel data; performance assessment; public spending; stakeholder

Data collection is the result of listed companies on the Vietnamese stock market in the period of 2006–2017 with 2,278 observations. Using the general least square (GLS) approach, the authors have identified three factors that have a positive and significant impact on corporate value: dividend payout, profitability, and corporate sizes; and one factor that has a negative impact on corporate value is the degree of financial leverage. The study found that dividend policy has a significant impact on the corporate value of companies that implement a higher dividend payout policy. Conversely, firms that do not pay dividends or pay low dividends do not experience a significant impact of dividend policy on corporate value.

We show that a long-relationship between gold price, dollar exchange rate and U.S. bank returns is well documented. As well, the behaviour and dynamics of such relationship are characterized by some salient features. In particular, the nonlinear adjustment of gold price against the U.S. financial market is well documented, implying that gold price plays a substantial role in creating a pressure on the dollar exchange rate and U.S. banks returns.

However, how much knowledge is transmitted to a country is not only the result of the overall level of connectivity, but also to whom a country is connected. For example, being well connected to an economy with wide-reaching global connections is likely to be a stronger conduit for knowledge transfers than being connected to an isolated economy. Likewise, connections are likely to complement each other. This wider definition of connectivity, referred to as multi-dimensional connectivity, is explored in this study as it applies to Europe and Central Asia (ECA). This paper shows that multi-dimensional connectivity is an economically and statistically important determinant of future economic growth. The paper further discusses the potential risks and transfer of shocks that can result from cross-country economic connectivity. Furthermore, it provides some examples of how policy tools can be designed to leverage the benefits of connectivity channels and mitigate their risks. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",economic connectivity; economic growth; Europe and central Asia; globalization; multi-layer networks; trade,Central Asia; Europe; economic analysis; economic growth; future prospect; globalization; knowledge economy; trade flow

These companies are selected which have paid dividend throughout the study period. Most of these companies are listed with either Bombay Stock Exchange or National Stock Exchange. This paper applies three alternative methods to verify and validate the results obtained from each other method. These methods are fully modified ordinary least squares (OLS), dynamic OLS and generalized methods of moments (GMM). Empirical findings of this research article depict that firm size, leverage and liquidity are significantly affecting dividend payout ratios and these variables have a negative relationship with the dividend payout ratio of the selected real estate firms. The results indicate that firm risk as measured through price–earnings ratio (P/E ratio) has a positive association with dividend payout ratio of selected real estate firms. Lagged dividend payout ratio used in the GMM test as an exogenous variable is showing positive significant association with dividend payout ratio. A firm's growth shows a negative relationship with dividend payout ratio using GMM technique. The present study shall be useful to different stakeholders of real estate companies. Various significant determinants as identified can be used by management for designing optimum dividend policy and providing maximum benefits to existing shareholders. Similarly existing as well as prospective shareholders may predict the future payment of dividend and accordingly they may take investment decisions in these firms, as the future fund's requirement of a firm depends upon dividend payment and retention ratio. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",dividend payout ratio; dynamic ordinary least square; fully modified ordinary least square; panel data; Sargan test,India; construction industry; empirical analysis; least squares method; panel data; stock market

The gross NPAs for Indian banks have increased by nearly four times from nearly USD 35 billion as of March 2014 to more than USD 150 billion as of March 2018. The factors responsible for this are political, macroeconomic as well as bank-specific in nature. In this study, we study the determinants of NPAs for Indian banks by using a panel dataset for 40 public and private banks in India, for the period March 2010 to June 2019 (quarterly-frequency). Among the macro-economic variables, we find the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), Consumer Price Index (CPI) Inflation, policy repo rate, and exchange rate to be significant determinants of NPAs. Among the bank-specific variables, we find gross loans and advances, provisions and contingencies, income on investments, and sector of bank (Public vs. Private) to be significant determinants of NPAs. We also find the role of demonetization (2016) towards influencing the NPAs of Indian banks, to be insignificant. Finally, we also provide some policy implications and remedial measures to tackle the problem of NPAs. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",bad loans; determinants of NPAs; India; non-performing assets (NPAs); panel regression,banking; data set; exchange rate; macroeconomics; performance assessment; policy approach; political economy

Our results suggest that, at the peak of financial crisis, the interbank spread was clearly driven by liquidity risk. In the aftermath of the crisis, credit risk has become the dominant driver of the spread. This effect is stronger in the Euro and UK markets, due to the escalation of the European sovereign debt crisis, and weaker in the Japanese market which experienced remarkably low credit pressures. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of monetary policy actions and demonstrate that the establishment of the unconventional policy programmes led to the deterioration of liquidity risk in the interbank market, and the policy of major Central banks to substantially cut interest rates kept credit pressures at low levels. We also partition the spread into expectation hypothesis and time-varying risk premium components and reject the hypothesis of constant risk premium. We find strong evidence of predictability inferred from the interbank spread model with time-varying risk premia. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",credit risk; interbank market; liquidity risk; no-arbitrage model; risk premia; unconventional monetary policy,United Kingdom; banking; credit provision; financial market; financial policy; financial system; monetary policy

The results indicate that there is unobserved heterogeneity and time-varying cost efficiency in the bank branches, and that inefficiency scores are low, at 1–15%. Time-varying cost efficiencies are positively associated with measures of the volume of business (the productivity based on value achieved by the branch) and negatively associated with the surface area of the branch and with time.

To examine the impact of ownership identity on firm performance, this study employs panel data analysis. It uses data of non-financial firms listed on Casablanca Stock Exchange (CSE) between 2004 and 2017. To uncover the hidden facets of the aforementioned relationship and examine how it is shaped by the financial crisis, a pre- and post-crisis analysis is performed. The findings reveal that institutional ownership affects positively firm performance in both, pre- and post-crisis periods. Compared to the pre-crisis period, investors further recognize and reward the value-enhancing role of institutional ownership during post-crisis period. Our analysis suggests that the incentives to expropriate minority shareholders within family-controlled firms increase during financial market turmoil. Family-owners switched from protecting to misusing the firm's resources for the sake of preserving their private interests. This research raises awareness for managers of family-controlled firms to review their corporate governance practices and align them with shareholders' value maximization. Our study suggests that Moroccan authorities must strengthen country-level governance mechanisms. The failure to accomplish this objective could have severe implications ranging from the inefficient allocation of resources in the economy to the destruction of shareholders' value. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",agency problems; emerging markets; financial crisis; firm performance; ownership identity,Middle East; Morocco; financial crisis; financial market; firm ownership; industrial performance; market development

We show that UMP shocks have a significant positive impact on both economic activity and inflation; stem financial market stress episodes and boost economic sentiment. Additionally, several channels seem to have been activated, including the exchange rate, inflation expectations and the bank lending channel. Counterfactual policy analysis suggests that a policy mix that combines the use of permanently negative interest rates with a balance sheet expansion at a steady pace over a long period, could bring inflation closer to the target.

Prediction on the volume of non-performing loans in Turkey using multivariate adaptive regression splines approach,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089580840&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2126&partnerID=40&md5=594cec41c1aa7f8da31ec81b0998a333,"As the volume of non-performing loans (NPL) plays an important role in the capacity of providing loans, increasing NPL problem is perceived as one of the major challenges in a bank-based financial system. In recent years, Turkey has been confronted with this problem. In order to reduce NPL volume, necessary precautions that can contribute to government administrators should be taken. Therefore, the most important predictors on NPL volume were determined by using predictive analytics such as multivariate adaptive regression splines that is found out the optimal parameter effects from high-dimensional data. The dataset, which is obtained from the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey and Banking and Regulation Supervision Agency, consists of 14 independent variables from 2005 and 2019. As a result of this study, it is indicated that credits, USD/TL exchange rate, and the unemployment rate are the most statistically significant factors in defining the level of NPL volume. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",banking sector; macroeconomic determinants; multivariate adaptive regression splines; non-performing loans; Turkey,Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo; banking; central bank; exchange rate; lending behavior; macroeconomics; multiple regression; multivariate analysis; performance assessment; unemployment
Does financial inclusion enhance economic growth? Empirical evidence from the IsDB member countries,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092664657&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2063&partnerID=40&md5=fe821e81ed82707df3552b14b5e86a44,"This innovative study examines the effect of financial inclusion measured by financial inclusion index (FII) on the economic growth of the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) member countries. The data were collected on different elements of financial inclusion and economic growth for the period 2000–2016. To draw multi-dimensional results, we have set up the panel data for 45 countries, and we estimated the generalized method of moments (GMM), two-stage least squares (2SLS), panel vector autoregressive (VAR) and panel Granger causality tests. Based on the results of dynamic panel estimations, we find that FII has a positive effect on economic growth. The findings of Granger causality analysis reveals a bi-directional causality of FII indicators with economic growth and a unidirectional causality between the FII and economic growth. Therefore, it suggests that the financial inclusion index has a positive effect on the economic growth in IsDB member countries. These findings recommend that the policymakers should consider financial inclusion as a driver of the economic growth in the long run. The empirical findings have useful policy insights for the IsDB member countries. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",economic growth; financial inclusion index; GMM; IsDB; panel VAR,banking; economic growth; empirical analysis; finance; Granger causality test; least squares method
Time-varying causal nexuses between economic growth and CO2 emissions in G-7 countries: A bootstrap rolling window approach over 1820–2015,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089915389&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2112&partnerID=40&md5=f4876237fd0ef0fdee13b1db82c69fcb,"This paper reinvestigates the causal nexuses between economic growth and CO2 emissions in G-7 countries during 1820–2015 for all countries except Japan, for which the data spans from 1950 to 2015.

Our empirical analysis suggests a long-run association between the variables. The bootstrap Granger causality test on the full sample and the sub-samples with a fixed-window size is used to resolve the issue of structural changes. The findings indicate that the causal relationships are country-specific. Consistent with the short-run stability tests, the rolling window analysis shows that causality between GDP and CO2 emissions is time-varying.

Partial adjustment towards performance-based mutual fund returns: Evidence from U.S.-based equity funds,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089584248&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2098&partnerID=40&md5=afbdd3a65cc7ba9cb2ade9c4f582da32,"Mutual fund managers face heavy competition and have incentives to quickly re-allocate their portfolios in order to achieve and beat their performance targets. However, portfolio adjustments are costly, as trading, administrative, and information costs reduce net returns. Therefore, managers face a trade-off between the benefits of adjusting the portfolio in order to achieve/exceed performance targets and the costs associated with these adjustments. We apply an asymmetric partial adjustment model to a sample of U.S.-based, open-ended, equity mutual funds. Our results show that active mutual funds quickly offset and reverse underperformance and have some success in maintaining short-term, above-average fund performance. The average mutual fund in our sample offsets 103% of the deviation within 1 month following underperformance, while slowing adjustment to 84% of the deviation following outperformance. Moreover, we link relative performance-driven portfolio rebalancing to heterogeneous information costs across fund investment objectives and find that funds focusing on acquiring more specific and costly information adjust more efficiently than those with broader investment objectives. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",active portfolio management; mutual fund performance and efficiency; mutual funds; partial adjustment models,United States; equity; finance; performance assessment; trade-off
Does EVA valuation model outperform earnings valuation model in explaining market value of equity?,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089695984&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2121&partnerID=40&md5=133c712058e59faaa97b75649873796f,"Most of the previous studies examine the efficiency of EVA versus accounting measures as a periodic performance measure. There is hardly any study conducted on examining and comparing the efficiency of EVA based valuation model with the earnings valuation model. However, this study examines and compares the efficiency EVA valuation with earnings valuation by conducting relative information content analysis across the years and on a year-wise basis. It is observed that future growth value is the only difference between the two valuation models. This study further examines whether future growth value plays a significant role in increasing/decreasing the explanatory ability of EVA based valuation model compared to the earnings valuation model by conducting incremental information content analysis. It conducts both the analyses by using the sample data of 69 large-cap, 88 mid-cap and 79 small-cap companies over the period 2002–17. The relative information content analysis conducted across the years reveals that large and small-cap companies respond better to the earnings valuation model, whereas mid-cap companies respond better to EVA based valuation model. The incremental analysis reveals that future growth value plays a significant role in increasing the decreasing explanatory ability of the EVA valuation model. The analysis conducted year-wise manner also supported the fact. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",CAPM; EVA; EVAUCRR; EVAUVRR,industrial performance; market system; modeling; small and medium-sized enterprise; valuation
Measuring systemic risk and dependence structure between real estates and banking sectors in China using a CoVaR-copula method,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089665846&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2101&partnerID=40&md5=e31ccd7e8518dfbd848093a8fa4a43cb,"The aim of this paper is to study the dependence structure between the real estate and the banking sectors in China. Various time-varying symmetric and asymmetric copula functions of the elliptical and Archimedean families are used to model the underlying dependence structure. Furthermore, it analyses risk spillover effects between these two sectors by quantifying three risk measures, namely, the value at risk (VaR), the conditional value at risk (CoVaR) and the delta conditional value at risk (ΔCoVaR). Over the period from January 2005 to March 2019, the empirical results show that there exists evidence of significant and symmetric dependence structure between these two sectors and Student's t copulas best capture this dependence. Moreover, we find that there are significant risk spillover effects from the real estate to the banking sectors, and vice versa. By considering different periods of financial distress, the empirical results show that risk spillover effects during the 2015–2016 Chinese stock market turbulence period are much significant than that during the 2007–2008 global financial crisis. Furthermore, the statistical tests show that the real estate sector contributes significantly to systemic risk of the banking sector, and vice versa.

As a result, all countries have started to increase their real sector expenditure by increasing the share of finance. Hence, this study aims to examine the effects of both financial development and real sector on economic growth; we choose five emerging market economies to explain the economic growth process between 2000 and 2016. The results of long-run elasticities document that real sector and financial development play a significant role in promoting economic growth. The results also suggest that money supply, exchange rate and inflation have a considerable positive effect on economic growth, respectively. Given these findings, we suggest that both governments and policy makers of the BRICS nations to initiate more effective policies to increase the real sector expenditure and develop financial sector. The increasing real sector will allow the economies to grow further by ensuring sustainable economic development across the BRICS member countries. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",economic growth; emerging market economies; financial development; real sector,economic development; economic growth; exchange rate; financial system; inflation; sustainable development

Third, we estimate the impact of a ratings change on FDI inflows in the presence of two types of crises, the 2007–2009 global financial crisis as well as country-specific crises. The results suggest that sovereign ratings have a statistically significant impact on the flow of FDI to EMs and that the BRICS countries as a bloc exert a statistically significant contagion impact on the FDI inflows into the three regions examined.

The determinants of export sophistication: Does digitalization matter?,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089296865&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2058&partnerID=40&md5=c0f5fad5879ca7a82a65787d5731dfc4,"Due to innovation, productivity surged and the structure of exports shifted towards sophisticated products in recent decades. In this study, I analyse the determinants of export sophistication with a special focus on the effects of digitalization for 61 countries by employing three measures of export sophistication. To my knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the nexus between digitalization and sophistication. It is found that exports get more sophisticated as digitalization promotes. In line with the literature, institutional quality, access to credit, and R&D are concluded to be other drivers of export sophistication. However, the evidence on tertiary enrolment and FDIs is mixed. Finally, the level of democracy seems to have a limited effect on sophistication indicating countries that have an autocratic rule also have a chance to sophisticate their exports. In the light of these findings, governments are advised to improve property rights, rule of law, the ease of doing business, access to credit, tertiary enrolment, and R&D expenditures to sophisticate their export baskets. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",development; export sophistication; growth; institutions; internet; R&D,democracy; economic growth; export; innovation; Internet; property rights; research and development
Governance disclosure quality and market valuation of firms in UK and Germany,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092095893&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2053&partnerID=40&md5=1cf221ec25ab0808be6b685dad4d4ec3,"This study develops a “comply or explain” index which captures compliance and quality of explanations given for non-compliance with the corporate governance codes in UK and Germany. In particular, we explain, how compliance and quality of explanations provided in non-compliance disclosures, and various other internal corporate governance mechanisms, affect the market valuation of firms in the two countries. A dynamic generalised method of moments (GMM) estimator is employed as the research technique for our analysis, which enabled us to control for the potential effects of endogeneity in our models. The findings of our content analysis suggest that firms exhibit significant differences in compliance, board independence and ownership structure in both countries. The “comply or explain” index is positively associated with the market valuation of UK firms suggesting that compliance and quality governance disclosure are value relevant in the UK. Institutional blockholders' ownership is, however, negatively associated with the market value of firms, which raises questions about the monitoring role of institutional shareholders in both countries. We argue that both compliance and explanations given for non-compliance are equally important, as long as valid reasons and justifications for non-compliance are provided by the reporting companies. These findings thus imply that the “comply or explain” principle is working well and that UK and German companies could benefit from the flexibility offered by this principle. With respect to the role of board size, board independence, ownership structure, and institutional ownership of firms, this study offers policy implications. © 2020 The Authors.

By using the default parameter setting (9, 26, 52) of Ichimoku Kinkohyo, we found that although several profitable trading strategies were obtained for stock index trading and currency trading during the Subperiod 1, experimental results in the Subperiod 2 revealed that they failed to create values consistently. Finally, evidence from parameter sweep showed that several Ichimoku trading strategies may well prove to be profitable on stock index trading, but none was found for currency trading. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",FX market; Ichimoku Kinkohyo; out-of-sample test; parameter sweep; stock market; trading rule,investment; profitability; stock market; trade

Despite steep growth in dollar debt and its critical implications for firms and macroeconomic stability, the issue was not explored before. This article attempt to fills this gap and contribute to the literature on dollar debt and open economy macroeconomics. We estimate the panel regression to quantify the balance sheet and competitiveness effects. We show that currency depreciation does not adversely affect the investment of those firms that borrow in foreign currency. The findings of the study imply that the gradualist approach to liberalization and prudential policy measures laid by regulatory bodies were effective. We also find that firms that incur dollar debt do not possess adequate natural hedge against exchange rate volatility. This finding calls for the mandatory hedging by firms to immune the economy from the contagion effect. The development of offshore derivatives markets is indispensable for such hedging. The findings also call for the availability of easy and cheaper domestic credit to the corporate sector to lessen the over-reliance on external commercial borrowings. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",balance sheet effect; dollar debt; emerging markets; exchange rate; exports,competitiveness; currency devaluation; debt; economic impact; exchange rate; export; financial market; financial policy; investment; lending behavior; liberalization; macroeconomics
Predicting GDP growth with stock and bond markets: Do they contain different information?,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089201103&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1980&partnerID=40&md5=60ac45ea2b31cd33dd1b9e8b15cf73ee,"This paper examines the ability of bond and stock markets to predict subsequent GDP growth over a range of horizons for 12 international countries. The results, using linear, probit, time- and regime-varying in-sample regressions and out-of-sample forecasting, confirm the view that both financial markets exhibit predictive power for future output growth. Moreover, there is notable variation within the strength of the predictive relation, for example, predictive power increases during the financial crisis period. Results suggest that while the term structure arguably exhibits stronger predictive power, both series contain distinct predictive information. Notably, predictive power emanating from the stock return series appears stronger over shorter (up to four-quarter) time horizons, while the term structure series exhibits more consistent predictive power over a range of horizons. Considering different regimes, we observe that the bond market exhibits greater predictive power for a flatter yield curve and lower stock prices relative to fundamentals, while the stock market exhibits greater predictive power for a steeper yield curve and higher relative stock prices. This suggests that the two financial markets exhibit different information content for future output growth. This view is further supported by forecast results whereby a model that includes both financial series outperforms a model that only includes one. Forecast encompassing tests further support the view that stock returns contain additional information over that presented by the term structure alone. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bonds; forecasting; GDP growth; predictability; stocks; variation,Matthiola; capital flow; capital market; economic development; economic growth; Gross Domestic Product; investment; stock market

Our principal finding confirms long-run association among financial innovation, human capital development, and economic growth of selected South Asian countries. Also, we found both long-run and short-run elasticities from financial innovation and human capital development to economic growth is positive for each country. The study confirms that economic growth of sample countries would positively affect any development in financial innovation and increase in investment for human capital development in future. We also perform a Granger-causality test to investigate directional causality, and we found bidirectional causality between financial innovation and economic growth, and human capital development and economic growth both in short-run and long-run, thus, supporting the feedback hypothesis.

At this point, this study brings novelty to the existing literature by considering the effects of neighbour countries' macroeconomic variables on domestic financial stress and by focusing on financial stress interaction between emerging economies using spatial econometric methods. According to the estimation results, we find current account balance/GDP, economic growth, geopolitical risk and global risk are the most important determinants of financial stress. It is also observed that there is a strong interaction of financial stress among emerging market economies. While geographical linkage is the most important transmission channel of financial stress among those economies, financial and trade linkages also play an important role. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",emerging market economies; financial contagion; financial crisis; financial stress index; spatial econometrics,econometrics; economic growth; financial crisis; Gross Domestic Product; macroeconomics; market development

The result of NRCA shows that all OPEC countries have a comparative advantage in crude oil production, whereas five of the 10 non-OPEC countries have a comparative advantage in crude oil production. The result of the ARDL indicates that crude oil price (COP) and average of daily production (ADP) positively affect comparative advantage of crude oil production. The effect of natural resources (PR) is negative, suggesting that an increase in PR decreases the comparative advantage of these countries—a result that aligns with the philosophy of Hotelling rent.

Why does fund size matter? These are a number of typical questions that puzzle practitioners and academics alike. To date, the data has been shown to be somewhat problematic. This paper exploits the SPIVA and passive fund datasets with several novel methods in order to build a foundation for unbiased fund performance analysis and comparison. For this, we address a number of questions including: passive versus active management, fund size, time horizon and fund style on performance. We find that in general, passive funds outperform active funds due to lower management costs, larger funds tend to perform better and funds with longer (3+ years) records of accomplishment tend to perform better. Short termism tends to have a significant detrimental effect on performance. We introduce Dynamic Generalized Method of Moments to show that competition has a significant effect on fund performance. Furthermore, this demonstrates that SPIVA data has a significant dynamic panel time series that was largely ignored by prior research. This integrated dataset and associated methods that we illustrate here, provide both academic researchers and industry analysts alike with an environment to investigate and potentially draw conclusions about the fund factors that affect performance without the inherent limitations of the original sources. © 2020 The Authors.

Results indicate that firms with a larger proportion of female directors serving on the board are more likely to pay higher dividends, but this positive finding is weaker when the firms experienced a higher number of mergers and acquisitions deals. Interestingly, extended analyses on female directors' positions show the opposing effects of female Chairmen and female CEOs on a firm's payout strategies. Although a female Chairman is associated with higher dividend payout levels, a female CEO shows an adverse impact. Yet these results tend to be reversed for firms with more merger and acquisition transactions.

Sentiment-Apt investors and UK sector returns,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089180394&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1964&partnerID=40&md5=a768543ecc694d01bca69e9c0551905c,"This paper examines the relationship between sentiment-apt investors and UK stock returns at industry level over the period January 1988 to December 2017. Using two new sentiment proxies (laggards to leaders and growth opportunity index) for 10 discrete sector groupings, we provide novel evidence on how returns in the UK stock market react to the activities of sentiment-disposed investors. First, using threshold nonlinear regression, we document a significant relationship between the laggards to leaders sentiment proxy and sectoral returns. Our findings reveal that aggregate returns in the sector are affected by activities of investors who embark on profit-taking when there is an increase in the proportion of lagging to leading stocks beyond the threshold value. Secondly, when using the growth opportunity sentiment proxy, we report that the increase in growth above the growth threshold value has a significant impact on sector returns. This study further confirms significant impact of non-threshold variables on sector groupings. Our findings are robust, having been subjected to a range of robustness checks. © 2020 The Authors.

Rather complements than substitutes: Firm value effects of capital structure and financial hedging decisions,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087835420&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2045&partnerID=40&md5=1064ae990661585c3c2067977afee028,"The aim of this study is to analyze the interaction between capital structure decisions and risk management decisions as well as the channels through which they add value to firms. Competing theories are considered in an integrated path model, which we test by means of meta-analytic structural equation modelling (MASEM). This meta-analysis is based on 6,312 reported results, which are manually collected from 411 empirical studies. We find that capital structure mediates the relation between corporate financial hedging and firm value. In this regard, active risk management positively affects leverage by providing greater debt capacities. Furthermore, leverage has a negative impact on firm value. Hence, capital structure and financial hedging decisions appear rather as complements instead of substitutes. This implies that managers should leave additional debt capacities unused and instead use additional internal funds arising from active risk management to carry out profitable projects and research and development activities. Overall, corporate hedging is found to especially add value to a firm by lowering bankruptcy risks and underinvestment risks. © 2020 The Authors.

Stochastic convergence in real personal disposable income in the EU: A note,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089199977&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2125&partnerID=40&md5=a26caff21a1bd7a2d2c26f7a480c2851,"Economic convergence has long been a declared objective of the EU and has been considered the fundamental mechanism for achieving socioeconomic cohesion. Even so, the empirical literature finds a lack of real convergence as geographical clusters have emerged. In this paper, we contribute to the literature on income convergence in the EU by analysing convergence in real disposable income across European countries. In contrast to the previous results on real convergence in the EU, we find that most of the countries are converging to the same equilibrium level. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",cluster; convergence; disposable income; Europe,Europe; convergence; European Union; income; stochasticity
The asymmetric effects of industry specific volatility in momentum returns,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088298158&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2130&partnerID=40&md5=dbd24cb19da6a69b57e3d2dfcbcb4b06,"In this paper, we look specifically at the effect of industry volatility on momentum returns, a phenomenon that has been overlooked in previous studies. We find that industry volatility has asymmetric effects on the winner and loser portfolios. The cross-sectional variation in the returns of high and low-volatility winners is driven primarily by industry volatility. It disappears after controlling for the effect of industry volatility on total firm volatility. However, for firms in the loser portfolios, the differential return between high and low volatile stocks remains even after adjusting for industry volatility. This implies that momentum returns are mainly induced by industry specific news at the winners' level and firm-specific factors at the losers' level. The results are robust even after controlling for different levels of liquidity. © 2020 The Authors.

Optimal and naive diversification in an emerging market: Evidence from China's A-shares market,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092148754&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1984&partnerID=40&md5=ae76182d12f67e56afb8c92c38127107,"This paper empirically investigates the out-of-sample performance of the 1/N naive rule and the Markowitz mean–variance strategies in the largest emerging market (i.e., China's A-shares market) and provides three new findings. First, we show that some mean–variance optimization strategies can outperform the 1/N rule in China's A-shares market, while minimum-variance strategies cannot. Using certainty equivalent return (CER) instead of Sharpe ratios does not change our results qualitatively. Second, we find an obvious advantage of mean–variance optimization when N is large. Third, when transaction costs are taken into account, the profitability of the unconstrained mean–variance optimizations almost vanishes, while the profitability of the mean–variance optimizations with the short-sale constraint remains. Our results are robust to using a shorter estimation window of about 60 months. These results provide support for the use of optimal diversification strategies in emerging markets. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",1/N naive diversification; China; mean–variance optimization; portfolio choice,China; estimation method; optimization; profitability; transaction cost
The value relevance of Other Comprehensive Income: Extensive evidence from Europe,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089295792&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1990&partnerID=40&md5=d088a48c4917bca231404885a0b8f464,"This study investigates the value relevance of the Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Limited literature has focused on the relevance on equity price and return. We go further by including the usefulness of OCI volatility on equity total risk which contributes to the inconclusive debate on how markets perceive different pieces of accounting information. After the adoption of the IAS (1), companies must disclose information about OCI, which shifts the focus from net income to comprehensive income. It shows the return that a company has made on its economic resources, determining a potential support for improving investors' decision-making process. Contrarily, some studies demonstrated that comprehensive income is not a true performance indicator because it includes nonrecurring items (i.e., unrealized gains and losses related to the change in the fair market value of available-for-sales securities). To test the relevance aspects of the OCI, we focus on the European context, and in particular on the analysis of the super sector leaders in Europe, the companies of the STOXX 50 index over the period from 2010 to 2016. We find a weak negative association between OCI and equity price, and it is a firm specific effect. Similar weak mixed relationships with equity return is found and in particular it is a year-specific effect. In addition, our findings reveal that the volatility of OCI is positively related to equity total risk. Compared to U.S and other international contexts, the findings provide novel insights at the European Union level about the inconsistent valuation usefulness of OCI. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",comprehensive income; Europe; price; return; value relevance; volatility,Europe; Indicator indicator; equity; income; investment; risk; valuation
Fiscal sustainability in the EU after the global crisis: Is there any progress? Evidence from Poland,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089681975&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2001&partnerID=40&md5=2fb3af9915abc76ae9d0248110a0fed1,"In response to the global crisis, a number of new institutional measures have been introduced in the fiscal framework, both on the EU and on the member states' level, and the question is: Have these measures provided better fiscal sustainability outcomes? We approach this question by looking at the evolution of fiscal sustainability in Poland, which is an interesting case of a member state that without significant market pressure (the only EU country without recession during the crisis) actively promoted several changes in the EU fiscal framework (e.g., six-pack) and effectively internalized some of these key changes in its domestic fiscal policy, including a domestic expenditure fiscal rule. Our analysis reveals that the fiscal sustainability in Poland has significantly improved in the post-crisis period of 2009–2017: We detect both improvement of the fiscal sustainability parameters and structural breaks in the fiscal outcomes after the crisis. Namely, in comparison to the whole sample of 2004–2017 the strength of reaction of the primary deficit to a change of the public debt increased in the post-crisis time by nearly 50%. Importantly, these results are robust with respect to the pension fund reform which led to a one-off redemption of T-bonds in amount of 8.5% of GDP. The analysis also reveals a cycle of structural breaks of 2-and 4 years lags: For the output gap in 2008 Q4, for the primary deficit in 2010 Q4 and for the public debt in 2014 Q1. The case of Poland seems to suggest that the post-crisis EU fiscal measures can be effectively used to increase fiscal sustainability, if properly approached and internalized into the domestic fiscal framework. More research should be devoted to understanding the political and economic conditions under which such positive outcomes were possible. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",fiscal policy; fiscal sustainability; global crisis; public debt; sovereign debt; structural break,Poland [Central Europe]; crisis management; debt crisis; European Union; expenditure; financial market; fiscal policy; Gross Domestic Product; policy reform; political economy; sovereignty; structural adjustment; sustainability
Do determinants of fees differ between Islamic and conventional funds?,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089676001&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1978&partnerID=40&md5=cd76b68518c0540c0cd890ac19752a3b,"This paper examines the effects of country conditions on fund manager fees. By using an international sample of 607 funds from 23 countries, the authors show that legal, culture, and political risk have robust effects on fund manager fees. The findings indicate that Islamic and conventional funds in developing countries with weaker legal settings and higher corruption have higher fixed and performance fees. However, performance fees are lower and fixed fees are higher in countries with higher political risk. Overall, Hofstede's cultural values significantly affect the fund fees with robust differential effects between Islamic and conventional funds. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",fund fees; Islamic funds; managerial compensation; mutual funds; political risk,compensation system; culture; developing world; finance; Islamism; politics

We also find that banks' capital structure plays an important role in explaining bank's risk-taking appetite.

Restricting the relative weights in data envelopment analysis,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094213542&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2007&partnerID=40&md5=6d41a530cf0efd2a23f08515e57392f9,"In this paper, we address the problem of relative weight restriction in data envelopment analysis (DEA). A fuzzy-based approach to restricting the relative weights is proposed in this study. Unlike the classical weight restriction methods, the proposed approach has an interactive orientation. That is, similar to analytical hierarchy process, the proposed method shares the decision maker (DM) in weight restriction process. Here, the preferences of DM are asked via pairwise comparison matrices. Then, the weights of factors (inputs/outputs) are extracted from these matrices. These weights, finally, are incorporated in multiplier DEA models as the parametric triangular fuzzy numbers, in which, the parameter value indicates the degree of conformity of the relative weights according to DM views. To best of our knowledge, no one has been yet utilized fuzzy set theory to control the relative weights in DEA. Putting in another word, the contribution of this study is that the authors propose a new approach based on fuzzy set theory to weight restriction in DEA. A last, a real case on financial banking efficiency is used to illustrate the proposed approach. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",analytical hierarchy process; data envelopment analysis; fuzzy number; relative weight; α-cut,analytical hierarchy process; comparative study; data envelopment analysis; econometrics; fuzzy mathematics
Does corporate social responsibility influence firm probability of default?,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089386384&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1966&partnerID=40&md5=9f04687bb2b80e197efdfc6d8b540b3b,"This study extends the literature on the capital structure of corporate social responsibility (CSR) firms by examining the effect of CSR on the firm probability of default using a sample of 496 firms from 17 developing countries for the period 2010–2017. This paper employs the two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) technique that mitigates the endogeneity problem. Our findings for the full sample show that high CSR participation reduces the firm probability of default in developing countries. Our results are robust after separating the sample into four regions. Precisely, CSR participation reduces the probability of default in Asian, Latin American, and European regions (except the African and Middle Eastern region). Overall, our findings suggest that as firms in developing countries increase their investments in CSR activities, the probability to default their obligations decreases. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",CSR; developing countries; panel GMM; probability of default,Asia; Europe; Latin America; capital; corporate social responsibility; developing world; financial services; investment; participatory approach
Real options and the perverse effect of interest rates on investment timing,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090159695&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2000&partnerID=40&md5=89ff27911353b15cdf2863c0c9644588,"This paper examines the relationship between investment and interest rates within the standard model of real options. We analyse the effect of interest rates on investment through the expected time until investment. The sign of the relationship is ambiguous, and critically dependent on the choice of the state variable and the parameters taken as model primitives. If the payout rate of the project (dividend yield) is taken as a model parameter, results are robust. The main novel conclusions drawn from the analysis are the following. Firstly, we provide new conditions under which increasing the interest rate accelerates irreversible investments. In particular, a raise of the interest rate favours investment when the initial value of the state variable is far from the optimal threshold; in some cases, investment is favoured independently of the value of the state variable. Secondly, the level of volatility affects the investment/interest rate relationship; in particular, a raise of the interest rate tends to favour investment in hi-tech sectors (the opposite conclusion holds for mature sectors). Thirdly, the analysis implications remain under costless reversibility. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",aggregate sector investment; costless reversibility; irreversibility; perverse responses of interest rates; real options,capital flow; capital market; cost analysis; interest rate; investment

A number of measures and initiatives, such as, energy efficiency, renewable energy technologies and emission-control are proposed in order to reduce CO2 emissions. This study examines the long-run relationship between R&D investment and environmental sustainability in a panel of 25 European Union (EU) member countries over a period of 17 years (1998–2014). We use robust and reliable econometric methods to capture the interactions between R&D investment on renewable energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The findings confirm that the growth of R&D expenditures promotes renewable energy consumption and plays a significant role in reducing CO2 emissions in the sample countries. Furthermore, the findings suggest that increasing the share of renewable energy consumption in the total energy mix also reduces CO2 emissions. Given these results, we suggest that the EU policymakers provide more financial and regulatory assistance to the R&D activities, specifically in the energy sector, to ensure promoting low carbon economies in this region. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Carbon emissions; R&D; renewable energy; sustainability,alternative energy; carbon emission; energy use; European Union; expenditure; investment; policy making; research and development; sustainability

Dynamic operating efficiency and its determining factors of listed real-estate companies in China: A hierarchical slack-based DEA-OLS approach,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089694127&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1965&partnerID=40&md5=655872ee5ce3a0ba9f38134e72f3c8af,"This study uses a dynamic slacks-based measure (SBM) model in a data envelopment analysis (DEA) framework with surplus reserve and accounts receivable as desirable and undesirable indicators respectively, based on inter-connectivity between consecutive periods to estimate the operating efficiency of 110 listed Chinese real-estate companies in the first step analysis. The results show that 35 listed real-estate companies in China operated on the efficient frontier by maintaining sustainable growth throughout the entire period. The analysis presents the projection of indicators to suggest a feasible solution to improve the inefficient terms. At the second step analysis, using ordinary least square (OLS) estimation, authors find a curve-linear relationship between real-estate company size and efficiency to suggest that operating efficiency increases as size also increases due to economies of scale but only up to an optimum point. Profitability and higher education are also identified as the other significant determinants of operating efficiency. The findings of this research present evidence that average efficiency scores vary over time and generally comove with China's economic growth rate and the average stock returns in the real-estate sector. By providing a new framework for evaluating input, output and carry-over indicators of real-estate companies, the results of this study equip real-estate companies to have an accurate perspective of their operating position and simultaneously provide investors with an avenue to evaluate real-estate companies' development before any form of investment. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",data envelopment analysis; dynamic SBM model; efficiency; listed Chinese real-estate companies,China; data envelopment analysis; econometrics; efficiency measurement; housing market; industrial performance; numerical model; profitability

Thus, this paper explores this issue in a novel way that utilizes a quantile regression to revisit the association between CG mechanisms and EM. We find that a non-uniform relation between CG mechanisms and EM for non-financial U.S. firms does exist from 2007 to 2015. Specifically, the empirical evidence documents that CG mechanisms can effectively constrain earning manipulation among firms with higher discretionary accruals (High EM). However, this effect becomes insignificant for firms with medium and low levels of discretionary accruals (Low EM). The quantile-varying results provide further support for the theoretical viewpoint that the CG mechanism can serve as an effective tool for supervising management in the financial accounting process but only in the case of firms with aggressive EM behaviour. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",audit committee; corporate governance; director; earnings management; quantile regression,United States; corporate strategy; governance approach; income; management; regression analysis

Banking concentration was found to affect instability negatively, which supported the “too important to be bailed out” view. Furthermore, we found that Islamic banks were less stable compared to conventional banks. We also found that bank size, profitability and capital regulation increase bank stability.

International trade and income convergence: Sorting out the nature of bilateral trade,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089140567&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2068&partnerID=40&md5=82222b32354c40e983d8574543b28315,"The paper argues that the dynamics of trade induced income convergence depend on the nature of bilateral trade between nations. To justify this argument, the paper presents a comprehensive approach that explicitly accounts for trade among OECD countries (north–north trade), trade between OECD and SSA countries (north–south trade) and trade among SSA countries (south–south trade). The approach also allows for the identification of the direct and indirect effects of bilateral trade on income convergence. The results show that bilateral trade among OECD countries accelerates income convergence both directly and indirectly. This result appears to be consistent with the new trade theories by Krugman, Journal of International Economics, 1979, 9, 469–479; Krugman, American Economic Review, 1980, 70, 950–959. and the intuitions of Heckscher, The effect of foreign trade on the distribution of income 1919, 1950, 1–32 and Ohlin, Interregional and international trade, 1933. The trade-convergence relationship for OECD to SSA trade is the strongest both directly and indirectly. This is the empirical evidence that the nature of this bilateral trade, promotes one directional knowledge spillover from developed to developing countries, which enables developing countries to adopt new technologies and grow faster than their rich counterparts. However, bilateral trade among SSA countries does not have any significant effect on income convergence. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bilateral trade; economic growth; economic openness; GMM estimator; income convergence,bilateral agreement; convergence; developing world; economic growth; income distribution; international trade; OECD; parameter estimation

We find that fundamental timing strategies based on moving average (MA) timing signals could generate substantial performance gains relative to buy-and-hold strategies. The annualized average return of fundamental timing strategies reaches about 37% with Sharpe ratio nearly 1.30. These findings are robust to Fama–French factor model adjustment, alternative lag lengths of MA signals, holding days, and transaction costs. Moreover, the fundamental timing premium cannot be explained away by market timing or business cycle, and fundamental timing is more profitable among firms with high idiosyncratic volatility and high illiquidity. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Chinese stock market; fundamental timing strategy; trend-following; value investing,China; United States; cost-benefit analysis; financial market; financial services; investment; stock market; strategic approach; trend analysis

Being innovative in the choice of the methodological framework as well as underlying factors of interest, we employed the monthly data on the policy-related uncertainty indexes, Chicago Fed National Activity Index (CFNAI) and Kansas City Federal Reserve Financial Stress Index (KCFSI). Our key empirical findings suggest that the co-movements of policy uncertainty, financial stress and economic activity are frequencies as well as time-dependent. The uncertainty indices are found to be synchronised at lower and intermediate frequencies for all of the pairs. In the nexus between uncertainty and economic activity, financial stress plays a crucial role. Co-movement of the policy uncertainty is observed to be more pronounced during the crisis periods though at different frequencies which indicated the usefulness of the proposed framework to analyse the implications of contemporaneous policy uncertainty and financial stress for the real economy. Concomitantly this informs the policy efforts to address the financial and economic instabilities which may arise as a consequence of financial stress and policy uncertainty. © 2020 The Authors.

Using a Bayesian approach, different MS-GARCH structures are estimated considering specifications up to three regimes, three scedastic functions and six error distributions, resulting in a total of 54 models for each cryptocurrency. Forecasts are compared according to an economic criterion, that is, through the estimation of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) risk measures. The results support the evidence of regime changes in the volatility process of selected cryptocurrencies and show that MS-GARCH models do provide more accurate VaR and ES forecasts than their single-regime counterparts. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",cryptocurrencies; forecasting; MS-GARCH; regime switching; risk management,accuracy assessment; electronic commerce; error analysis; financial system; forecasting method; performance assessment; prediction; risk assessment
Peer effects in R&D investment policy: Evidence from China,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089173001&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2028&partnerID=40&md5=7730622b80485e81cc12a1d07039f543,"Using a typical linear model on a sample of listed firms in China over a period of 10 years (2006–2016), this study empirically attempts proving how peer effects influence corporate research and development (R&D) investment decision. The study goes further to demonstrate that peer effects play a significant and critical role in determining corporate R&D investment policies, and by extension the more important determinant than most traditional firm-specific factors. After dealing with endogeneity bias and conducting further robustness checks, the above conclusions were valid in this study. It has been theorized in contemporary research that both information and market competition are the main channels through which one can best appreciate peer effects and that firms with weak information acquisition ability and in highly uncertain or competitive environment are more likely to be affected by peer groups. We also find evidence that a firm's R&D investment status relative to its peer firms will affect its R&D investment decision. Moreover, the direction of peer effects follows the law of imitation. Thus, firms are more likely to imitate those peers who share similar characteristics. Yet, leading firms and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are exceptionally different as their R&D decisions are sensitive to both peer-followers and non-SOEs respectively. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",competition; imitation; industry peers; information; peer effects; R&D investment,China; competition (economics); economic policy; investment; research and development
The DuPont financial indicators and the short-term market performance of Chinese cross-border M&As: The moderating role of payment method,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089861508&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2012&partnerID=40&md5=a42bcaf7b316114f569b947e29877d80,"Using the data of Chinese cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) from 2003 to 2017, we investigate the influence of the internal financial conditions of enterprises on the short-term market performance of Chinese cross-border M&As by applying improved DuPont financial analysis, an event study and regression analysis and further explore the moderating effect of payment method in Chinese cross-border M&A. The findings are threefold. First, we observe significant positive cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) of Chinese cross-border M&As, along with the underperformance of cross-border M&As financed with pure cash payments compared to those financed with other payment methods. Second, the profitability and financial leverage of Chinese enterprises engaged in cross-border M&As are significantly positively and significantly negatively correlated with CARs, respectively, while the impact of the operating capacity on CARs is limited. Finally, we note that the negative influence of financial leverage on CARs is enhanced in pure cash bids, which indicates that the payment method plays a prominent moderating role in the impact of financial leverage on the short-term market performance of Chinese cross-border M&As. Our result suggests that one reason for the underperformance of cross-border M&As financed with pure cash payment compared to M&As financed with other payment methods is the negative effect of financial leverage, which is augmented in cross-border M&As financed with pure cash payment. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",abnormal stock returns; cross-border M&As; DuPont financial indicators; payment method,China; Trixis; market conditions; merger; profitability; regression analysis; stock market
Quantile causality and dependence between crude oil and precious metal prices,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088245169&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2119&partnerID=40&md5=a0b87316f74f0015408820342f653136,"This paper examines long-run dependence and causality between oil and precious metal (gold, silver, platinum, palladium, steel, and titanium) prices across quantiles by exploiting their time series properties with the help of novel econometric techniques. The empirical results for the period 1990–2019 indicate that oil and metal prices are nonstationary across different quantiles and that cointegration patterns differ widely across quantiles. Causality running from oil to metal prices is quantile-dependent and differs according to the metal, whereas upward and downward movements in metal prices have no causal effect on oil prices. These results have implications for investors and policymakers in terms of portfolio and risk management decisions. © 2020 The Authors.

A study on volatility spurious almost integration effect: A threshold realized GARCH approach,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089461497&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2006&partnerID=40&md5=3c5a55203cb543ecfb659ce2af2d794f,"This paper investigates the “spurious almost integration” effect of volatility under a threshold GARCH structure with realized volatility measures. To closely examine the effect, the realized persistence of volatility is proposed to be used as a threshold trigger for volatility regimes. Under the threshold framework, general closed-form solutions of moment conditions are derived, which provide a convenient way to theoretically examine the “spurious almost integration” effect and its associated impacts. We find that introducing the volatility persistence-driven threshold can capture regime-specific characteristics well. It performs better than the traditional GARCH-type models in terms of both in-sample fitting and out-of-sample forecasting. Based on our Monte Carlo and empirical results, in general we find that overlooking the relatively low-persistence regime(s) could lead to some misleading conclusions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",realized kernel; spurious almost integration; threshold realized GARCH model; value at risk; volatility persistence,finance; Monte Carlo analysis; persistence; time series analysis

The results show that an increase in EPU significantly reduces the market-driven common stock returns but increases individual-driven idiosyncratic stock returns. Further, EPU has a lower negative impact on the common stock returns of high-CER firms comparing with low-CER firms. EPU has a higher positive impact on idiosyncratic stock returns of high-CER firms comparing with low-CER firms.

On the one hand, political connections may help the firm to reduce the policy risk and access to more critical resources. On the other hand, political connections may introduce the government or politicians as influential stakeholders who may impose their own interests on other stakeholders and cause multiple agency conflicts. Although there are many studies have investigated the effects of political connections on firm performance in single countries, the worldwide effects of political connections are still ambiguous. Moreover, whether the value and costs of political connections are contingent on legal systems, regulatory institutions and industry characteristics are also under-explored. By using a sample covers 49 countries and 151,475 firm-year observations, we find that firms with financial constraints, firms in heavily regulated industries, and firms in countries with worse legal environment or shareholder protection mechanism are more likely to establish political connections. We further find that political connections have an adverse net effect on the firm's operating performance as well as the firm value. This adverse effect is especially pronounced if a firm is in heavily regulated industries. However, the cost of rent-seeking activities involved in political connections can be restrained in a better legal system or by a better shareholder protection mechanism, thus significantly mitigating the adverse effect. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",firm performance; legal environments; political connections,finance; industrial performance; industrial regulation; legal system; politics; stakeholder

The economic transition from the use of non-renewable energy tothe renewable alternatives is an interesting genre of research keeping the partial attainment of the United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Goals agenda into consideration. Against this milieu, trade and financial liberalization policies are anticipated to play a pivotal role in facilitating the renewable energy transition phenomenon across South Asia. The overall results from the econometric analyses imply that higher degrees of trade openness and greater foreign currency inflows can invariably play critically important roles in amplifying the shares of renewables in the total energy consumption levels across this region. Thus, these findings impose key policy implications for attainment of energy sustainability across South Asia. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",foreign aid; foreign capital flows; foreign direct investment; remittance; renewable energy consumption; renewable energy share; trade openness,Bangladesh; India; Pakistan; Sri Lanka; alternative energy; capital flow; econometrics; empirical analysis; financial policy; liberalization; numerical model; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; trade; trade openness; United Nations

As of March 2018, gross NPAs for all scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) stood at over ₹10 trillion, compared to merely 4 years back, that is, March 2014, when they were almost one-fourth of this. Aimed at tackling the NPA problem, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was enacted in 2016 by the Parliament of India, which provides for initiation and quick resolution of bankruptcy proceedings against defaulters. In 2017, the RBI identified 12 Mega-defaulters which accounted for nearly INR 1.75 trillion of the total NPAs of Indian banks. Targeting the NPA problem at the policy level requires extensive research and analysis in order to come up with effective action plans. This study tries to analyse NPAs of Indian banks using panel data regression models and identify their key determinants. It also examines the relative severity of the NPA problem in case of public banks as compared to private banks. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",determinants of NPAs; India; modelling NPAs; non-performing assets; panel regression,India; action plan; banking; bankruptcy; commercial activity; financial system; macroeconomics; performance assessment; private sector
Asymmetric exchange rate pass-through into import prices of Slovenia's manufacturing sector,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089152153&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2033&partnerID=40&md5=6732e0a6be058de3b78c3291a8bc9fbf,"The goal of this paper is to estimate the asymmetry of exchange rate pass-through into aggregate and disaggregate import prices and the composition of imports of Slovenia's manufacturing sectors. We used the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model and the monthly data from 2007:M1 to 2017:M12. We found that, in the long run, there was an asymmetry in the complete pass-through into aggregate import prices due to currency appreciation. Moreover, we found that for 6 out of 14 manufacturing sectors, there was a long-run asymmetry complete and partial pass-through due to the appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate. Compared with depreciation, long-run appreciation has a stronger impact on aggregate and disaggregate import prices of the manufacturing sectors. On the other hand, we found that there was a short-run asymmetry due to depreciation in the complete and partial pass-through for the majority of manufacturing sectors. Compared with appreciation, short-run depreciation has a stronger impact on aggregate and disaggregate import prices of the manufacturing sectors. The degree of asymmetric pass-through is higher for aggregate and disaggregate import prices of the manufacturing sectors compared to the degree of symmetric pass-through. Finally, we confirmed that the degree of pass-through is higher for homogenous products than for heterogeneous products. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",asymmetry; composition of imports; heterogeneity; homogeneity; import prices,Slovenia; exchange rate; heterogeneity; homogeneity; import; manufacturing; price dynamics

This model allows a direct dating of events that alter the global volatility structure, based on a permanent/transitory decomposition in the structure of returns and volatilities and the estimation of market risk measures. We conclude that the multivariate stochastic volatility model complements the information revealed by the spillover index and can be a useful tool in measuring and managing risk in global financial markets. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Bayesian estimation; common factors; multivariate stochastic volatility,Bayesian analysis; comparative study; estimation method; financial market; global economy; spillover effect

Using a comprehensive risk disclosure index covering nine dimensions, we analyse the level of risk-related disclosure (RRD) in a sample of 72 Islamic banks and 97 conventional banks across 11 countries. The RRD index shows that Islamic banks disclose less information about risk comparing to conventional banks. Listed banks, larger banks and aged bank disclose more information about risk than the others. Block holders, foreign ownership and board size affect negatively risk disclosure. However, board independence and the percentage of foreign directors in the board affect positively risk disclosure. Moreover, banks with higher Tier 1 ratio disclose less information about risk. Our results encourages regulators to improve corporate governance mechanisms in their banking systems through the optimization of ownership structure (dispersed ownership) and the board's composition in order to promote higher level of transparency and RRD. © 2020 The Authors.

By modifying the first assumption (i.e., the financial constraint) we find a significant result for the debate on ex-ante vs. ex post crisis interventions: the latter could be completely ineffective to manage crises and, instead, macro-prudential policies are still able to correct the externality that stems from the underestimation of the social costs of decentralized debt decisions. By modifying both assumptions (i.e., with the modified financial constraint and counter-cyclical fiscal policy) we find that some combinations of policy interventions could completely avoid crises, but under restrictive conditions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",credit constraint; ex post policy; financial crisis; fiscal policy; macro-prudential tax,credit provision; debt; financial crisis; fiscal policy; tax system

We argue that this was a highly unusual period with abundant global liquidity, substantial decrease in domestic real interest rates, considerable growth in capital inflow and bank lending, but a remarkable deterioration in external balance. Our empirical approach sheds light on both short and long run dynamics among key domestic and global economic indicators, those related to monetary policy, capital inflows, domestic spending, exchange rates and external deficit. Overall, while clearly validating the import dependency of the Turkish economy, our findings provide mixed evidence about the role of monetary policy on external deficit. Among the monetary policy tools tested, only the reserve requirement policy, seems to have a direct effect, however, real interest rates seem to be influential only via the channel of consumer loans and consumption expenditures. Expansions in bank lending cause corresponding increases in components of national expenditure, which subsequently contribute to the deterioration in trade deficit. As for the policy implications of our findings, to reduce external deficit, in long run, lowering the import dependency of the economy and reducing the shortfall in national savings is vital, whereas, in short run, only distortionary policies, such as limiting loan growth or restricting imports, are only feasible options. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",capital inflows; external deficit; loan growth; monetary transmission mechanism,Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo; capital flow; capital market; economic growth; financial market; financial services; monetary policy

Evidence from a global sample of 140 countries,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087832067&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2056&partnerID=40&md5=0e1085ccd4dc66a87e5fa17caf2e291b,"The current research explores the role of financial sector development on the control of corruption in a global sample of 140 countries. Using annual data from 1996 to 2015, this study makes use of system generalized method of moments technique to identify the determinants of corruption across the full sample, low and lower middle-income countries and, upper middle and high-income countries. Our empirical findings show that financial development plays an important role in controlling the growth of corruption across the full sample, low and lower middle-income countries and upper middle and high-income countries. Similarly, per capita income has a significant positive impact on control of corruption in upper middle and high-income countries, while education plays a similar role in low and lower middle-income countries. On the contrary, the per capita income, trade openness, government expenditure, political rights and civil liberty are the major factors, which promote the growth of corruption in low and lower middle-income countries, whereas trade and civil liberty play the same role in high-income countries. Given these findings, our study makes number policy recommendations and adds new knowledge to the empirical literature. © 2020 The Authors.

Reliability assessment of scenarios generated for stock index returns incorporating momentum,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089384695&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2002&partnerID=40&md5=4dfb05ee69cf8ce63bf9c45c71c1a773,"Stochastic programming models for portfolio optimization rely on scenario paths for returns derived from stochastic process models. This paper investigates a variant of the geometric Brownian motion process for stock index returns that incorporates index momentum. Based on this model, three different processes for generating scenarios on a rolling basis are devised, which differ according to how frequently the momentum parameter is updated and whether it is estimated according to a simple moving average or an exponentially weighted moving average of returns. The reliability of scenario sets generated for multiple instances is assessed by applying a recently developed statistical tool. Backtesting is conducted in case studies of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index for two different historical periods. The numerical results show that the frequency with which the expected return is updated does not significantly influence the performance of the scenario generation procedure, whereas how the expected return is calculated affects the autocorrelation and dispersion of generated scenarios drastically. All scenario generation schemes are highly sensitive to the estimated volatility of the index returns. Among the three processes tested, the algorithms that incorporate momentum estimates according to an exponentially weighted moving average can generate reliable scenarios when the volatility estimation error is small. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",index return; momentum; scenario generation; scenario reliability assessment; volatility,capital flow; exchange rate; financial market; financial system; model test; reliability analysis; stochasticity; stock market
High-frequency trading order cancellations and market quality: Is stricter regulation the answer?,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088598412&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2071&partnerID=40&md5=0399b3b4c6a49e23f89895d31d4270c1,"High-frequency traders (HFTs) frequently submit, cancel and resubmit trading orders in an attempt to stay in front of the queue. This study shows that HFTs cancel a large number of limit orders within 50 ms in order to create arbitrage opportunities in the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). We find that HFTs generate substantial profits after transaction costs and are capable of extending their strong profitability generating record in the future. Our empirical results indicate that institutional investors lacking speed are more likely to experience higher execution costs. We propose the introduction of batch auctions, one per 50 ms of trading, to impose a queuing risk for HFTs leading to positive market quality effects. © 2020 The Authors.

Should stock investors include cryptocurrencies in their portfolios after all? Evidence from a conditional diversification benefits measure,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089192115&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2116&partnerID=40&md5=227c39a02b1c2647ab65030d872bf9fb,"Higher media coverage and stronger investor interest in cryptocurrency market may create closer linkages with traditional assets, leading to deteriorated diversification benefits. Cryptocurrencies have recently emerged as an alternative digital asset class; however, very little is known about their portfolio performances. In this study, we investigate the time-varying investment benefits of cryptocurrencies for stock portfolios using a correlation-based conditional diversification benefits (CDB) measure. We construct six portfolios consisting of cryptocurrencies, developed and emerging equity markets and find that the time-varying correlations between cryptocurrencies and stock markets are generally low. However, the level of correlations significantly increases in turbulent periods, such as Brexit referendum and Coincheck hack. The dynamic CDB measures suggest that adding cryptocurrencies to equity market portfolios enhances portfolio diversification; however, the benefits of diversification have diminished after late 2017. Our results offer significant insights and potential implications for market participants. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",cryptocurrencies; diversification; dynamic conditional correlation (DCC); dynamic equicorrelation (DECO); portfolio optimization,correlation; currency market; digitization; electronic commerce; financial system; optimization; stock market
Macrofinancial linkages in Europe: Evidence from quantile local projections,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088796524&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2080&partnerID=40&md5=843b1ccc171137bbb45ed7cc14bdc3f8,"The paper investigates macrofinancial linkages in the sample of 16 European economies over January 1997–December 2019 from a new twofold perspective. First, we put a particular emphasis on the role of news-based sentiment measures in these relationships, that is, economic policy uncertainty and global geopolitical risk. Second, we pursue a hybrid econometric approach to capture a presumably nonlinear nature of these linkages by building on different quantiles of the data series and estimating impulse responses from smooth local projections (Barnichon and Brownlees, Review of Economics and Statistics, 101(3), 522–530, 2019). Our results legitimize such approach as the number of statistically significant impulse responses based on this approach is skewed towards upper (75th and 90th) quantiles. We find that global economic policy uncertainty index dampens the growth rates of industrial production in Austria, France, Italy, Luxembourg and Slovakia, which calls for specific measures to mitigate this adverse effect at the national level, for example, by curtailing yellow journalism, populist ideas and disbeliefs. However, there is only minor evidence for the relationship running between economic policy uncertainty and financial stress. Global geopolitical risk appears irrelevant in the country- and panel-level analyses. Meanwhile, the VIX index performs a pervasive role in undermining industrial production and increasing economic policy uncertainty in Europe. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",economic policy uncertainty index; financial stress; global geopolitical risk; local projections; quantiles,Austria; Belgium; France; Italy; Luxembourg [Belgium]; Slovakia; econometrics; economic policy; financial market; geopolitics; industrial production; uncertainty analysis
Current account and financial reforms: Evidence from sub-Saharan Africa,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090224390&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2015&partnerID=40&md5=0cf19e8271100d16df41efb0d928d34b,"This study investigates the relationship between financial deregulation and current account imbalances in a panel of 14 Sub-Saharan African countries over the period 1990–2015. While there are plethora of studies linking financial (de)regulation and economic crisis, the relationship between financial deregulation and current account imbalances has received little attention to date in the growth literature. Relying on the Classical-Keynesian theoretic perspective, the study adopted the fixed-effects panel least square estimation technique to determine the effects of financial reforms on current account balance. Our results are robust, suggesting a significant but negative relationship between financial reforms and current account balance. The results further suggest that factors that positively affect current account balance include terms of trade, inflation rate, gross domestic savings, per capita income, and net foreign assets. A policy shift towards improving terms of trade, and gross domestic savings, through expansion in aggregate output and devaluation of the domestic currency will increase internal market competitiveness within the region. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",current account; economic growth; financial reforms; sub-Saharan Africa,Sub-Saharan Africa; economic growth; estimation method; financial market; financial provision; financial services; inflation
Revisiting the linkage between oil and agricultural commodity prices: Panel evidence from an Agrarian state,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089149691&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2083&partnerID=40&md5=1b1cb8ef7c3ef4a5f3f1a809917c6da5,"This paper utilizes panel methods to consider the dynamic relationship between oil and agricultural commodity prices. The study makes use of monthly measures realized data for six agricultural commodity prices, including cocoa, coffee, wheat, palm oil, soybeans, beef and crude oil. The dataset spans the period 2006–2015 and includes a measure for the effective exchange rate. The results of a panel unit root test suggest that all the variables are stationary after taking the first difference. The Fisher/Johansen cointegration test is then used to suggest that the dataset includes a single cointegrating vector. A regression on the long-run characteristics of the data is then used to show that crude oil prices are positively correlated to agricultural commodity prices. This suggests that oil price for the case of Nigeria drives demand for agricultural crop commodity. The results show that agricultural commodity prices in Nigeria are responsive to global oil prices. The subsequent causality test that account for heterogeneity tests performed on the first difference of the variables reject the null hypothesis of no Granger causality in either direction between crude oil prices and agricultural crop commodity. This suggests that oil prices drive agricultural commodity prices and vice versa.

Teaching financial education in schools and students' financial literacy: A cross-country analysis with PISA data,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089454510&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2005&partnerID=40&md5=d0614bba732346d49da065551645d265,"In the last decade, developed and emerging economies have become increasingly aware of the importance of ensuring that their citizens are financially literate. Eighteen countries and economies, including 13 OECD countries, participated for the first time in 2012 on the financial literacy assessment of 15-year-old students. Financial literacy scores varied according to the participating countries, and they were determined by factors related to the teaching-learning process, especially those related to the delivery of financial education in schools. This paper assesses the effectiveness of the provision of financial education in the school curriculum across all the countries that participated in PISA 2012—data from 2015 did not allow such analysis. We measured the direct effect of different ways of financial education delivery on students' financial literacy scores, after controlling for math and reading performance, and individual characteristics of students and their schools. The majority of the countries have introduced financial education topics in the curriculum somehow. But only in the Flemish Community of Belgium, the United States, and Latvia—and to a lesser extent in Australia, Estonia, France, Israel, Poland, Spain, the Czech Republic, the Russian Federation, and the Slovak Republic—the way how financial education (FE) is delivered is positively correlated with students' financial literacy scores: FE taught as part of business or economics courses in Belgium, FE taught as part of a cross-curricular subject in the U.S., and FE taught as part of mathematics in Latvia. Our main findings pose fundamental challenges for educational policy regarding school-based FE. The first is to decide at what age (grade) interventions should be introduced into the education system so that students are not only financially literate but also financially competent. The second is to devise instructional approaches that more effectively lead young people to put pertinent financial knowledge into practice and to do so correctly when they make financial decisions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",financial education; financial literacy; multi-level analysis; PISA 2012,Australia; Belgium; Czech Republic; Estonia; France; Israel; Latvia; Poland [Central Europe]; Russian Federation; Slovakia; Spain; United States; curriculum; education; financial market; financial services; OECD; student; teaching

In turn, funding illiquidity is transmitted through banks and broker/dealers to market illiquidity of individual stocks. Thus, funding illiquidity, often originating with central bank monetary policy, is contemporaneously conveyed through institutional lenders, transferred to broker/dealers and spawns interconnected stock market illiquidity spirals and loss spirals.

We provide a new mixture of Gram–Charlier distributions that have been used in this framework for the first time and derive a close formula for directly computing expected shortfall. This model is compared to the Gaussian (benchmark model), Student's t, generalized Pareto (a case of the extreme value theory) and mixtures of Gram–Charlier distributions.

This study shows that the managers with higher ability take less usage of real earnings management. The results also indicate that managerial ability, economic and financial crisis have significant and negative effects on real earnings management. This negative effect of managerial ability on real earnings management increases in the conditions of economic crisis.

Capital account opening has positive allocation effects if the economy is financially less developed than the rest of the world, but negative effects otherwise. I test the model predictions on a sample of 113 countries, using the relative price of consumption and investment goods as a measure of allocation efficiency. I find that international capital flows indeed have adverse effects in highly developed countries, whereas there is less evidence of positive effects in low-development countries.

A fixed-effect panel technique with OLS regression is used to investigate the impact of macroeconomic factors on the ICF sensitivity applying data from a sample of 74 non-financial firms listed on the Saudi stock market over the period 2004–2018. The results show that the ICF sensitivity is positive, and is a lot larger for more constrained firms. Compared to developed markets, the results show higher ICF sensitivity in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Moreover, the results reveal that business environment of KSA has a considerable influence on the sensitivity of investment to internal funds. The evidence also shows that better macroeconomic conditions relax financial constraints faced by firms, and thereby reduce the sensitivity of investment to internal financing. Expansionary monetary policy, financial development and liquidity abundance reduce the dependence of firms on their internally generated funds when undertaking new investment projects. Finally, the results show that investment expenditures are more sensitive to internal cash flow during the crisis period, supporting our conjecture that constrained access to capital markets is more likely to be detected during times of liquidity crises. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",financial constraints; financial crisis; financial development; financial reform; investment–cash flow sensitivity; monetary policy; oil price,Saudi Arabia; capital flow; financial crisis; financial market; financial policy; financial services; investment; macroeconomics; monetary policy

Second, financial crisis significantly impacts the relationship between leverage and firm-level determinants, particularly accentuating the effect of asset tangibility and growth.

Asymmetric volatility spillovers between world oil prices and stock markets of the G7 countries in the presence of structural breaks,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089193779&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1997&partnerID=40&md5=199f23150a49a1af057212d30f59d3d8,"The purpose of this paper is to examine the volatility transmission between oil prices and the seven major stock markets (G7) using symmetric and asymmetric bivariate GARCH models incorporating structural breaks. Since these countries play a crucial role in the international economy, it is important for financial market participants to understand the volatility transmission process for designing optimal portfolio allocations. We examine weekly data over the period 1998–2017 and endogenously detect structural breaks in variance using an iterated algorithm in order to estimate the volatility dynamics with greater accuracy. The models were estimated using the maximum likelihood method, and the BFGS algorithm was employed to obtain the variance–covariance estimation and the corresponding standard errors. Overall, we find volatility spillovers between markets together with the fact that the oil market has a leading role. More importantly, we show that neglecting structural changes in variance and/or asymmetries may lead to biased volatility spillover effects. Furthermore, the results highlight that models ignoring structural breaks are significantly overestimating the effect of their own past volatility on the current volatility. In addition, we find that disregarding asymmetries could also lead to erroneous estimates of these effects. Finally, we compute dynamic risk-minimizing hedge ratios and optimal portfolio weights, however, no significant discrepancies are found among the models considered. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",asymmetries; bivariate GARCH; oil price; stock market; structural breaks; volatility spillover,algorithm; econometrics; G-7 country; oil production; oil supply; oil trade; spillover effect; stock market
Role of the legal and financial environments in determining the efficiency of working capital management in European SMEs,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089080265&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2061&partnerID=40&md5=53ceeaad3bfb6f714ebd27c0d510c4f6,"This paper focuses on whether the rule of law or capital market development can explain observed differences in working capital levels and trade credit in SMEs from 13 EU countries. Our findings indicate that the working capital levels are lower and working capital management is thus more efficient in countries with safer legal systems and better investor protection. We also find that operating in a market-based capital system has a negative effect on the cash conversion cycle (CCC). This implies that firms operating in countries with a market-based system as opposed to a bank-based system have better opportunities to manage their working capital. Our findings indicate that country-level legal instruments explain much of the cross-country differences observed in working capital. The results also suggest that working capital practices and the extent to which trade credit is used are a product of the legal system and the financial systems in place in each country. If the financial system changes, the trade credit practices can also be expected to change. © 2020 The Authors.

A theoretical analysis,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094214775&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2014&partnerID=40&md5=508b366bc3f7cefdd7ac2cdb38ea753d,"The emergence of finance companies has affected the competitive strategies of financial service industry and has also altered the financing patterns of various borrowers. This study's theoretical model illustrates that finance companies are able to offer larger loans and reach risky niche-market borrowers more easily than banks can because of certain advantages of the finance company's business model, including unique funding sources, cross-subsidization, relatively low collateralization costs, and extensive financial intermediation. The resulting loan terms are typically more attractive than those that banks can offer, including higher loan-granting ratios. These advantages can expand borrowers' financing sources and thereby reduce their financing difficulties. This is especially the case for risky borrowers or entrepreneurs who operate small- and medium-size enterprises. Such borrowers, who typically face liquidity constraints and are thus willing to pay higher interest rates, are more inclined to obtain operating funds from finance companies than from banks. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",collateral; finance companies; financial intermediation; loan contract; non-traditional lenders,banking; competition (economics); financial market; financial policy; financial services; financial system; strategic approach
The effects of institutional settings and risks on bank dividend policy in an emerging market: Evidence from Tobit model,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089291694&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2027&partnerID=40&md5=b989f2303154d7b9fa598a5590dbfcae,"This study investigates specifically the effects of institutional settings and risks on dividend payout policy for banks operate in an emerging market of Nigeria. The present study measures the risk by using financial, business, credit, and default risk at the bank-level and financial, economic, and political risk at the country level. To achieve the objective of this study, panel data random-effects Tobit estimation methodology is employed from the period 2007–2016. Findings reveal that the weak institutional settings lead Nigerian banks to pay out fewer dividends and set their payouts corresponding to the substitution agency model of dividends. Also, results show that Nigerian banks typically pay out more dividends in cases of growth opportunity as a substitute mechanism for mitigating agency problems and for establishing a good reputation. However, by strengthening the levels of investor protection, Nigerian bank managers prefer a low payout policy and are less probable to use dividend policies as a substitute mechanism. Moreover, except for the positive effect of default risk, findings show that the risks at the bank-level, in particular, business risk, and at the country level, particularly financial and economic risks, have a significant negative effect on dividend payouts. Results are robust to alternative estimation procedures and also document that global risk has a statistically significant negative impact on Nigerian banks' dividend payouts policy. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",agency theory; dividend policy; institutional settings; Nigerian banks; risks; substitute model,Nigeria; banking; econometrics; financial policy; market conditions; organization; risk
Credit information sharing and bank loan pricing: Do concentration and governance matter?,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089291217&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2099&partnerID=40&md5=96e844c3bc35d959dd0cc74f412b9883,"The development of credit information sharing schemes in developing countries has gained significant attention in recent times along with ongoing financial sector reforms. In this paper, we provide first-hand evidence of the effect of credit information sharing on credit intermediation cost in these countries, and consequently ascertain the extent to which the credit information sharing–credit intermediation cost nexus may be accentuated by banking market concentration and governance quality. Using a large dataset covering 272 banks from 27 African countries over the 2004–2012 period, we uncover four new findings. First, we find that credit information sharing does reduce credit intermediation cost. Second, we show that the relationship between credit intermediation cost and credit information sharing is conditional on banking market concentration. Third, our findings suggest that governance quality moderates the effect of credit information sharing on credit intermediation cost. Finally, we find that banking market concentration reduces credit intermediation cost, but the effect is moderated by credit information sharing. Overall, our findings suggest that credit information sharing may serve as a useful policy tool for achieving financial sector stability in developing countries. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Africa; banking market concentration; credit information sharing; credit intermediation cost; developing countries; governance,banking; credit provision; developing world; financial market; governance approach; lending behavior; reform process
Foreign investor dominance and low domestic investor absorption capacity: Implications on capital outflows,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089393697&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2018&partnerID=40&md5=cb9933b00a4acb8fea70df8cdf68f576,"This study puts forward the increased share of foreign investors as a potential stabilizer for local financial markets, especially equity markets, because domestic investors' weak absorption capacity may create liquidity constraints acting as an obstacle for foreign investor. We pin down the effects of foreign investor dominance based on a detailed stock-ownership data. Our findings suggest that in emerging financial markets with high foreign investor ownership and low absorption capacity of domestic investors, capital outflows might be staggered, and this phenomenon might reduce the probability of large and sudden depreciation of local currencies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",absorption capacity; capital outflows; equity market; foreigner effect; liquidity constraint; staggered adjustment,capital flow; capital market; equity; financial market; financial system; investment
Religiosity and financial distress in U.S. firms,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089694145&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1994&partnerID=40&md5=96a376a5469430dee12c884831b5e7c1,"In our paper, we test the global impact of religiosity on firm's durability. Given that religious firms are more ethics and take less risk, they avoid the costs of misconduct, and they benefit from the good reputation and the excellent relationship with their stakeholders. So, we predict that higher degrees of religiosity can reduce the financial distress. According to this prediction, we detect that corporates headquarters situated in more religious U.S. counties are probably less to suffer from financial problems. We also note that this negative relation becomes stronger during the crisis period. We conclude that the lack of religiosity is a significant cause of the financial difficulty. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Ethics; financial distress; religiosity; risk aversion,United States; cultural economy; cultural influence; ethics; financial system; industrial performance; religion; risk assessment
U.S. stock prices and macroeconomic fundamentals: Fresh evidence using the quantile ARDL approach,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089176268&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1976&partnerID=40&md5=307dfa3aa8af9aecc6e282ae28a82375,"This paper explores the long-run relationship and the associated short-run dynamics between the U.S. stock market and three major macroeconomic fundamentals, namely the U.S. industrial production index, the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yield and the West Texas Intermediate oil price, for the time period covering 1985–2015. The quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) model presented by Cho et al. (2015) Journal of Econometrics, 188, 281–300, which combines the autoregressive distributed lag model of Pesaran and Shin (1998), Cambridge University Press, and Pesaran et al.

This approach analyses the links among the variables over a range of quantiles which represent different states of the equity market. The findings show a significant quantile-varying cointegration relationship between U.S. equity prices and the three selected macroeconomic factors. The U.S. industrial production index is found to have the largest long-run influence on the equity market. These findings highlight the importance of market players as well as policymakers to develop a greater understanding and awareness of how macro variables impact stock prices under different stock market conditions, particularly in relation to optimal asset allocation and risk management strategies, among others. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10-year Treasury bond yield; ARDL model; industrial production index; macroeconomic fundamentals; oil price; quantile regression; stock prices,United States; industrial production; macroeconomics; numerical model; oil supply; price dynamics; regression analysis; stock market
A heterogeneous ensemble credit scoring model based on adaptive classifier selection: An application on imbalanced data,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089499523&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2019&partnerID=40&md5=4c8b431aa869f97948cab415f35fd638,"In the domain of credit scoring, the number of bad clients is far less than that of good ones. So imbalanced data classification is a realisitc and critical issue in the credit scoring process. In this study, a novel heterogeneous ensemble credit scoring model is proposed for the problem of imbalanced data classification. This proposed model is on basis of five standard classifiers, namely LSVM, KNN, MDA, DT, LR, and adaptively selects the base classifiers with highest AUC according to the data distribution, then integrates all base classifiers to obtain a prediction. Finally, by using five comprehensive performance measures and four classical credit datasets, we find that the proposed model is better than other baseline models. This novel model can be applied to actual credit scoring and assist financial institutions in credit risk management. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",binary classification; credit scoring; ensemble model; heterogeneous ensemble; imbalanced data,classification; credit provision; data set; ensemble forecasting; numerical model

We examine this assertion in the context of eight South and Southeast Asian emerging economies. Economic growth over the last three decades has been impressive in the region though TOT has shown an overall declining trend. Using panel cointegration and pooled mean group estimation techniques, we establish a long-run relationship between TOT and income, and TOT and investment. Our Fully Modified OLS results provide adequate evidence of the long-run relationship of TOT with income and investment in South and Southeast Asia. Despite a positive relationship, TOT movements do not exert a significantly large impact on income in the short run. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",economic growth; panel cointegration; South and Southeast Asia; terms of trade,Southeast Asia; cointegration analysis; economic growth; investment; panel data; terms of trade; trade agreement; trend analysis
"Fossil energy consumption, economic development, inward FDI impact on CO2 emissions in Pakistan: Testing EKC hypothesis through ARDL model",2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089454539&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1958&partnerID=40&md5=3b6a155f4e9c0d1d7f2f29037b258283,"The rapid rise in carbon production has been broadly accepted as a serious global issue and has become the centre of focus for policy makers and researchers. The consumption of fossil energy has been a chief source of carbon dioxide emission; in the meantime, academics focus on fossil energy consumption impact on carbon dioxide in developing like Pakistan is very infrequent. The current study investigated the long-run and short-run elasticities between economic development, square of economic development, fossil energy consumption, inward foreign direct investment (FDI) and carbon dioxide emission by utilizing the auto-regressive distributive lag (ARDL) bound test technique for Pakistan from 1975 to 2014. The outcomes of co-integration have confirmed the existence of long-run relationship between variables. The results of short-run and long-run dynamics have confirmed the inverted U-shaped relationship between economic development and carbon dioxide emission. ARDL model long run and short run coefficients have indicated that the fossil energy consumption has positive impact on carbon dioxide emission. Moreover, the impact of FDI on carbon emission is also quite considerable. Overall, the outcomes propose that Pakistan should encourage sustainable growth through energy efficiency, support the use of low GHG emission and efficient technologies, increase the consumption of renewable energy sources and channel the inward FDI to environment-friendly technologies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",ARDL model; carbon dioxide emission; economic development; fossil energy consumption; inward FDI,Pakistan; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; developing world; economic development; energy use; environmental economics; foreign direct investment; fossil fuel; policy making
Do investors gain from forecasting the asymmetric return co-movements of financial and real assets?,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089145834&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1961&partnerID=40&md5=a5b50427f19149de0fd0da7a9f2a4f57,"Recent research on asset allocation emphasizes the importance of considering non-traditional asset classes such as commodities and real estate—the former for their diversification properties, and the latter due to its importance in the average investor's portfolio. However, modelling and forecasting asset return co-movements is challenging because the dependence structure is dynamic, regime-specific, and non-elliptical. Moreover, little is known about the economic source of this time-varying dependence or how to use this information to improve investor portfolios. We use a flexible framework to assess the economic value to investors of incorporating better forecasting information about return co-movements between equities, bonds, commodities, and real estate. The dependence structure is allowed to be dynamic and non-elliptical, while the state variables follow Markov-switching stochastic volatility processes. We find that the predictability of return co-movements is significantly improved by incorporating macro and non-macroeconomic variables, in particular inflation uncertainty and bond illiquidity. The economic value added to investors is significant across levels of risk aversion, and the model outperforms traditional multivariate GARCH frameworks. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Asset allocation; Co-movement; copula; economic value added; forecast; macroeconomic variables; Markov models; portfolio optimization; regimes; volatility,economic analysis; financial market; financial services; financial system; investment; macroeconomics; Markov chain
Investors' trading behaviour and stock market volatility during crisis periods: A dual long-memory model for the Korean Stock Exchange,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088323566&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2024&partnerID=40&md5=90655e2a2072817ac9a66646713765a7,"This study examines the impact of investors’ buy and sell trades on Korean stock market volatility across two crisis events, the Asian crisis of 1997 and the 2008 global financial crash. We investigate the trading behaviour of domestic vs. foreign and institutional vs. individual investors. Our results suggest that the buy and sell trades have an asymmetric effect on volatility that depends on the type of investor trading and on the phase of the business cycle. Buy orders appear to be more informative than sell orders since they mostly lower volatility in the pre-crisis periods, while sell and post-crisis buy trades affect volatility positively regardless of who trades (institutional or individual investors) and on what information (member, non-member). Most importantly, decomposing total buy and sell trades into trader-type categories reveals that some institutional investors are more informed traders that stabilize the market compared to individuals that always increase volatility. Foreign investors reduce volatility with their purchases and total trading activity in the whole Asian crisis sample, but only in the pre-crisis period before the recent global financial turmoil. © 2020 The Authors.

Uncertain SBM data envelopment analysis model: A case study in Iranian banks,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089146645&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1927&partnerID=40&md5=557709cb7e7ef1d176279530677d7e12,"Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a strong analytical tool and methodology for evaluating the relative efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs). The DEA models require inputs and outputs, which are equipped with precise information. However, the real-world inputs and outputs are probably so changeable and complicated that cannot be measured accurately. Consequently, this conflict leads to the analysis of uncertain DEA models. This paper aims to analyze the slacks-based measure (SBM) model in an uncertain environment where the uncertain inputs and outputs are belief degree-based uncertainty. The belief degree-based uncertainty is useful for the cases in which no historical information of an uncertain event is available. As a solution methodology, the uncertain SBM model is converted to a crisp form by using three approaches separately: expected value model, expected value and chance-constrained model, and dependent chance-constrained model. Additionally, an alternative uncertain model is introduced to reveal differences of DMUs rankings in three crisp methods. Finally, an applied scenario regarding the Iranian banking system is documented to present the new models. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",belief degree; data envelopment analysis; Iranian Bank; SBM model; uncertainty theory,Iran; accuracy assessment; banking; computer simulation; data envelopment analysis; efficiency measurement; input-output analysis; model validation; numerical model; precision; uncertainty analysis

We study the response on global financial markets to the Brexit process during the period that covers January 1, 2016 to November 30, 2018. We apply joint tests of contagion where the contagion channels are the conditional correlation, the coskewness and the covolatility between the United Kingdom as a source of contagion and the remaining recipient markets. Our results reveal financial contagion on the main European and international economies consistent with the effect of the Brexit referendum results and the subsequent increasing uncertainty. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Brexit process; endogenous tests; financial contagion; market index; stock markets,United Kingdom; capital flow; European Union; financial market; financial system; investment; stock market

The Innovator performs innovative R&D and the Follower adopts the available technological knowledge. Substitutability between sectors, scale effects, international IPRs protection and R&D productivity determine the economic growth and the technological-knowledge bias, which, in turn, affects relative prices and wages. Wages are higher in the Innovator, namely in the nontradable sector under strong substitutability. Technological-knowledge and intra-country wage inequality are biassed towards the tradable sector, the effect being reinforced by positive IPRs protection and substitutability. Real exchange rates accommodate the Balassa-Samuelson proposal and increase with positive IPRs protection and substitutability. The effect of IPRs on the steady-state growth rate is ambiguous, depending on the substitutability. Theoretical results are also influenced by labor movements and are confirmed by a calibrated exercise for 11 developed/Innovator countries and 11 developing/Follower countries, and by the empirical evidence. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",directed technical change; intellectual property rights; international trade; prices; scale effects; substitutability; wages,economic growth; innovation; intellectual property rights; international trade; price dynamics; research and development; technical change; technological development

In light of this, we decompose stock variance into good and bad variances, and further construct a composite signed variance. The recursively estimated coefficient of standard variance is volatile over time, but the ones of good, bad, and signed variances are fairly stable. This suggests the high efficiency of our decomposition approach. We provide convincing evidence that bad variance and composite signed variance can significantly predict future stock returns both in- and out-of-sample. Furthermore, a mean–variance investor can realize substantial economic gains by using our bad and signed variances relative to the traditional variance predictor and simple mean benchmark.

We fill this gap. We conduct the analysis by employing the Fama and French (2015) five-factor model along with the usual Fama and French's (1993) and Carhart's (1997) models. We also propose an innovative methodology that takes into consideration the higher moments of the explanatory variables in order to deal with the non-normality and the heteroskedasticity of return distributions. Rather than inspecting Socially Responsible (SR) mutual funds as done by most of the existent literature, we concentrate on SR indexes, in the conviction to overcome some of the limitations that can potentially bias an analysis carried out on mutual funds. Our results show that both SR and conventional indexes performed almost in the same way independently of the financial market conditions. Little evidence can at best support the conclusion that SRIs dampened the downside risk during the recent financial crisis in North America only. At the same time, SRIs do not seem to suffer from a risk-adjusted perspective during normal times. As expected, SRIs bear a higher level of idiosyncratic volatility compared to their respective conventional investments. Our innovative methodology plays an important role in explaining the cross section of SR returns. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Fama–French five factors model; financial crisis; idiosyncratic risk; SRI indexes,North America; financial crisis; financial market; investment; market conditions; modeling

Consistent with the proposition of information economics theory, our findings suggest that information asymmetry is the main motive behind over-levered firms' preference for public targets. Specifically, we observe that over-levered acquirers not only prefer public targets, but also pick those with less information asymmetry. We find that, in the short term, the market reacts negatively to the announcement of public acquisitions by over-levered firms. However, in the long term these acquirers experience better operating synergies and values, measured by changes in return on assets and Tobin's q, respectively. Our results are robust after controlling for M&A deals-, firm-, industry-characteristics and endogeneity concerns using both propensity score matching and Heckman two stage methods. Overall, our findings support the premises of agency theory and Uysal, Journal of Financial Economics (2011), 102, 602–620 view that over-levered firms have a high tendency to pursue most value-enhancing acquisition deals due to the high pressure of holding high levels of debt. © 2020 The Authors.

Anticipating the value of share repurchase announcements: The role of short sellers,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088427836&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1974&partnerID=40&md5=2e79e5ee4a4c65f6f6b0b44104bef31e,"This study investigates whether short sellers anticipate undervaluation information before a repurchase announcement. Apart from exploring investment opportunities via searching for unfavourable information, short sellers should have the same incentive to identify favourable information to prevent potential losses. An observed significant negative relation between pre-announcement short selling activities and announcement abnormal returns supports the informed hypothesis. This negative relation is stronger under high levels of information asymmetry, and more significant when the repurchase announcement is associated with the undervaluation. © 2020 The Authors.

Systemic risk in the Chinese financial system: A copula-based network approach,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089156196&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1892&partnerID=40&md5=ab2253b654b7e3216abc715b493b9a42,"This article examines the systemic risk in the Chinese financial system by combining copula and graph theory approaches. We start from identifying the interdependence amongst financial institutions based on static and dynamic copula functions. A minimum spanning tree is then generated to analyse the network structure in the financial system in both static and dynamic contexts. Evidence from both static and dynamic analysis verifies the systemic importance of Industrial Bank Co., Ltd. Some others, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and Huaxia Bank Co., Limited, occasionally show systemic importance in the dynamic setting. We further examine the stability of the network structure and find that whilst the dependence structure exhibits time-varying patterns, certain relationships appear to be more stable than others. Our findings hold important policy and investment implications. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",copula; financial system; minimum spanning tree; systemically important financial institution,China; banking; finance; investment; network analysis; probability; risk
Does global value chain participation enhance domestic value-added in exports?

To do so, first, the study explores the forward and backward participation in GVCs which shows an increasing level of GVCs participation. Second, this study empirically investigates the impact of GVCs on the domestic value-added exports using panel feasible generalised least squares technique. The results reveal that both forward and backward participation has significantly improved the economic upgrading in case of EMEs. Further, the results show similar findings across several subgroups based on incomes, regions and others.

By employing the abnormal stock return variance and the abnormal trading volume as investor reaction proxies, we document that both A-share and H-share investors tend to have stronger reactions to their own local media than to overseas media (referred to as local media preference). To provide further support, we utilize three natural experiments, that is, the introduction of colocation by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, the launch of Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, and the inclusion of A-shares in MSCI indices as well as alternative ways to construct our main variables. In addition, we also confirm that this local media preference strengthens the market segmentation between these two share classes. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",investor behaviour; local bias; media coverage; social connection,China; Hong Kong; Shanghai; investment; mass media; media role; segmentation; stock market

We find that, in spite of the increasing compliance trend, there is no conclusive evidence that adherence to the UGGC guidelines is a performance relevant factor. This result seems to be robust, as it holds in the main analysis as well as in all the additional analyses conducted. Therefore, our findings would further support the lack of consensus in this line of research regarding the true impact of compliance with the globally disseminated codes of best corporate governance practices on firm performance.

Financial constraints and the export decision of Pakistani firms,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087774085&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2030&partnerID=40&md5=a1ccaf92b3aa9f34aab4470d7fd4b1c0,"The payment of sunk costs associated with the entry to foreign export markets highlights the significance of financial dimension in the firm decision. The sunk costs become a challenge for the financially constrained firms. In this paper, we study the relationship between financial constraints and the export entry decision of the firms in a lower-middle income country context. We use new measures of financial constraints in finance literature alongside widely used measures of financial health in trade literature to scrutinise the relationship for Pakistani listed manufacturing firms. We find that being less financially constrained is a vital determinant of the Pakistani firms' export participation decision irrespective the high firm leverage before entry. The undeveloped financial system and heavy reliance on bank loans for external finance in Pakistan may be the plausible explanations for our findings. Our results suggest that measures of financial constraints are more appropriate than the widely used measures of financial health in studying the determinants of the export participation decision. In addition, we find evidence that future exporters improve their financial conditions prior to entering the export markets. However, we do not find any evidence that exporting improves financial conditions of the firms after entry. © 2020 The Authors.

The democratic capital stock, which captures the nurturing and strengthening of the policy and decision-making environment and processes, as well as other social institutions in a nation, regardless of the degree of technological development is used as proxy for democracy. This distinguishes our approach from earlier studies of this nature; particularly for developing countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Our results suggest that democracy has no direct impact, and perhaps no impact at all on income growth, even though there appears to be many complementarities between democratic institutions and the immediate ingredients of economic development. The results of our analysis are also robust to alternative definitions of democracy. Moreover, the conflictual signals that derive from our sensitivity analyses using the indices of ethno-linguistic fractionalization and the politically relevant ethnic groups further strengthen the nature of the complexities associated with the debate on democracy and income growth in developing countries. In the absence of the democracy variable, our analysis reveals that income growth is significant, even with high ethnolinguistic fractionalization.

Secondary data from 28 firms registered at stock exchange were selected as population of the study. Data from time period of 8 years from 2009–2017 was taken from annual reports and statements of firms. For statistical analysis STATA-12 was used. Levin-Lin-Chu test is used for data stationarity. Mean, SD, correlation analysis and pooled ordinary least square were used for testing hypotheses. Fixed effect model and random effect model, Hausman test were used. Corporate social responsibility scored highest mean followed by returns on equity, earnings per share and lowest mean was scored by returns on assets. Correlation analysis revealed the positive and significant relationship among all variables. Pooled ordinary least square results show that corporate social responsibility has significant impact upon returns on assets, returns on equity and earnings per share. But most dominant is earning per share from coefficient value. Previous studies which claimed that by identifying CSR activities in annual reports would result in low returns on assets, low returns on equity and less earnings per share. Thus, findings of this study explained that by showing CSR in annual reports could result in high returns on assets, equity and earnings per share.

In addition, the dynamic causal interactions showed that bank risk-taking Granger causes only bank size in the system, but both capital adequacy and liquidity ratio Granger causes bank risk-taking and bank size. With estimation results of generalized impulse function, bank risk have generally have a positive shock in response to regulatory capital ratio while a negative shock in response to liquidity for the first two periods.

Evidence of speculative bubbles and regime switch in real estate market and crude oil price: Insight from Saudi Arabia,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088841816&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1971&partnerID=40&md5=62963ede4e0baf183d55bf1e77ead6fa,"The sector performances of many economies especially the oil-producing ones, are consistently linked with the volatility of the international crude oil prices. Considering the significance of the international crude oil price to the economy of the Saudi Arabia, the current study investigates the dynamics of the crude oil price and the country's real estate market. This is achieved by investigating the evidence of both speculative bubbles and regime switching in the crude oil and real estate market from October 3, 2005, to March 29, 2018. As such, the Supremum Augmented Dickey–Fuller (SADF) and Markov switching regression model were employed. Although there is no significant evidence of speculative bubbles in the Saudi Arabia's real estate market, the result reveals statistical significant evidence of price bubbles in the Brent crude oil price especially between the period of 2007 to 2008, which coincides with the Global Financial Crisis period. However, the Markov switching investigation reveal that there is evidence of significant and positive impact of crude oil price return on the real estate market in the regimes. Importantly, empirical evidence shows that the impact is higher in Regime 2 even as the global factor (proxy volatility index) is evidently significant. Although the regimes are persistent, the expected regime duration of the stable regime is of the higher quarter. This investigation is statistically significant and robust, especially when Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) price of crude oil is used in lieu of the European Brent price. The estimation result encourages more strict energy policies that tackle the Saudi Arabia's energy and the real estate challenges. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",crude oil; Markov switching; real estate market; Saudi Arabia; speculative bubbles,Saudi Arabia; capital flow; crude oil; econometrics; export; financial crisis; housing market; Markov chain; numerical model; oil trade; regression analysis

The empirical results are derived, first, through constructing daily measures of realized variance and semivariance from a high frequency 5-min interval data, and second, by fitting wavelet squared coherence and wavelet cohesion measure with time-varying weights. The realized volatilities of the currencies and their cross-currency influences are found to increase during the global financial crisis. The realized volatilities of the Euro, Swiss Franc, and British Pound are closely synchronized over the short-term horizon. However, over the long-run, the Euro, Swiss Franc, and Japanese Yen lead the realized volatilities of the British Pound, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar. The synchronization structure of positive and negative realized volatilities indicates asymmetric dependence among the currencies across time horizons. We further observe strong positive (negative) cohesion among the realized volatilities over the medium- and long-term horizons. Finally, significant counter cyclical comovements among the currencies are observed over the medium- and long-term horizons.

Emerging market firms save most of the operating cash flow. When the firms spend, they allocate the remainder to dividend payments first, followed by debt retirements, then equity repurchases and lastly investments. This pecking order of prioritizing savings and dividends ahead of other uses-of-funds highlight difficulties in accessing external finance and a stubbornly resilient signalling motive for firms operating under a high degree of information asymmetry and agency costs. We further find significant asymmetry and heterogeneity in the allocation of funds conditional on credit constraints, deviations from target and around the financial crisis.

The oil price–exchange rate dependences in oil exporters is slightly larger than in oil importers, even though the dependence is weak in general. More interestingly, we find strong evidence of significant risk comovement between crude oil returns and exchange rates through the analysis of lower–upper and upper–lower tail dependence as well as downside and upside CoVaRs. This comovement particularly showed asymmetric effects. Finally, we sum up some implications for investors, policymakers and exchange rate regulators from a holistic perspective of empirical findings. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",CoVaR; oil price; tail dependence; time-varying copulas; US dollar exchange rate,United States; crude oil; currency; exchange rate; price determination
Estimating expected shortfall using a quantile function model,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088596083&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2017&partnerID=40&md5=0728d965ff5e4febcb8c4dee32be9de2,"Distribution of financial returns defined by the existing GARCH models usually focus on the overall features such as the location, scale, skewness and kurtosis of the distribution. When using such GARCH models for expected shortfall (ES) estimation, it is difficult to consider specific information about the tails (such as the shape of the tails of the distribution), resulting in possible bias in ES estimation. We propose a quantile function threshold GARCH model to overcome some of the limitations of existing models. The model allows us to use the information including the skewness and tail shape of the distribution and the structure changes in the volatility of financial returns to obtain ES estimates. Our results show that the proposed model outperforms the benchmark models, confirming that tail shape of the distribution also plays an important role in ES estimation. © 2020 The Authors.

Additionally, it imposes norm constraints on the minimum variance portfolio with the elastic-net penalty to pick a reasonable number of assets and prevent extreme positions in the resulting portfolio.

Why are credit booms sometimes sweet and sometimes sour?,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089174072&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1950&partnerID=40&md5=3c6ba0db73dd9edd2016fd025fa882e0,"This paper investigates the commonalities and differences between benign credit booms and those that end up in banking crises by employing a Multinomial and a Sequential Logit model over a panel of industrial and developing countries. Some economic, political and institutional factors are found to play an important role in understanding the credit booms dynamics. In particular, this study shows that the quantity and price of credit, liquidity in the economy, economic growth, openness of the economy, government orientation, political stability and Central Bank independence are relevant to explain not only the occurrence of credit booms but also – and most importantly – whether they end up in a systemic banking crisis or not. While a better economic environment and Central Bank independence are essential for both industrial and developing countries to avoid credit booms from going badly, political factors seem to exert a stronger influence in developing countries. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Central Bank independence; credit booms; government ideology; multinomial logit; sequential logit,central bank; credit provision; developing world; economic growth; financial crisis; financial system; governance approach; independence; lending behavior
Adjusted beta based on an empirical comparison of OLS -CAPM and the CAPM with EGARCH errors,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088967159&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1977&partnerID=40&md5=2c4b4bcfbf05aef6e9bef855cb78823d,"This paper empirically investigates the differences between the systematic risk estimated by OLS and it simultaneous estimation with a GARCH errors. The systematic risk of an asset is estimated by the beta coefficient of the market line. According to the OLS hypothesis, the estimators are robust and residuals are white noise process. However various papers show the existence of statistical anomalies (stylized facts) in residuals (heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation and non-normality) rejecting the BLUE properties of estimators. In order to considerate these anomalies to modelize the hazard in residuals regression, we use ARCH processes class that has proved it efficiency in finance. We estimate simultaneously the parameters of the market line and those of the GARCH process for the 30 perennial equities listed in CAC40 for the daily period 2005 to 2015 and we compare them each other. We select the E-GARCH model providing the best residuals characteristics and we note significant differences with the OLS Betas particularly for equities with betas greater than 1. On this base, we estimate a linear relationship between the OLS Betas and the E-GARCH Betas considering this break to modelize the differences between these two kinds of Betas. By this way, Investors can quickly adjust the Beta with this tool without completely reestimating them with GARCH. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",beta; CAPM; EGARCH; GARCH,empirical analysis; error analysis; hazard assessment; investment; regression analysis; risk assessment

Microfinance and poverty reduction: New evidence from Pakistan,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088869676&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2038&partnerID=40&md5=b1c8b678947cbf572e0a1afb40249d06,"Microfinance is key to reducing poverty in Pakistan. While comprehensive finance is frequently considered as, it creates inclusive growth and poverty reduction in poor communities, and can be boosted by ease of finance. However, when the poor people are involved in the broader scale (different types of poverty level), can this microfinance work? We used an econometric model to test the symmetry approaches of the comprehensive financial organizations and the poor in poverty reduction activities to find the answers. Keeping this in view, we studied different determinants related borrowers for the poverty reduction with respect to access to Micro finance institutes (MFI) and productive loan. Despite some limitations, such as those arising from potential unobservable important determinants of access to MFIs, significant positive effect of MFI productive loans has been confirmed. The significance of “treatment effect” of coefficients has been verified by probit model. In addition, we found that loans for productive purposes were more important for poverty reduction by MFB (Microfinance banks) than MFI. However, in urban areas, simple access to MFIs has larger average poverty-reducing effects than the access to loans from MFIs for productive purposes. This leads to exploring service delivery opportunities that provide an additional avenue to monitor the usage of loans to enhance the outreach. Therefore, the results showed by probit model that access to MFI was better in urban areas and male borrowers thus achieved more loan. Therefore, it is suggested that for the poverty reduction, there is a dire need to improve and localize the Microfinance institutions in rural areas as well as to promote group lending methodology to avoid risk of getting loans and increase the number of both male and female savers. Thus, the saving value will be increased and side by side interest rate will be significantly achieved. Hence, it is concluded that the goal of providing sustainable financial services implicitly implies that MFIs provide financial services to the poor, whenever they find it profitable to do so. The removal of subsidy and the absence of interest rate restrictions could make the market for the poor become even worse as the market occupiers may act in their own interest. The powerful push will be needed from national economic and social impacts for the increasing support for microfinance. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",borrowers; loan; microcredits; Pakistan; poverty; savings,Pakistan; Varanidae; credit provision; interest rate; microfinance; poverty alleviation; savings
Environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis in the case of tourism island states: The moderating role of globalization,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090058673&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1938&partnerID=40&md5=158bf8f096a2cf423f06ef905e12b8eb,"This article examines the relationship between carbon emissions and international tourism growth through the channels of globalization and real income via testing the Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) over the periods of 1995 to 2016 for 16 selected tourism island states (TIS) that prioritized tourism as a means of maximizing economic growth. Using the dynamic panel-based pooled mean group method of autoregressive distributed lag, results confirm globalization-tourism-induced EKC hypothesis for TIS. This implies international tourism growth and carbon emissions, through the channels of globalization and real income are in a long-term equilibrium relationship. International tourism and squared term of real income have an inverse significant effect on carbon emission level, while globalization and real income without squared term exert positive and significant effects on carbon emissions level in the long run. Results of the direction of causality tests show that there is a two-way causality between globalization and carbon emissions, while result also shows one-way causality running from international tourism to carbon emissions level in the long-run in the case of the TIS. Thus, globalization-tourism-induced EKC hypothesis is suggested in the case of TIS. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",carbon emissions; economic growth; globalization; tourism; tourism island states,carbon emission; economic growth; globalization; Kuznets curve; tourism; tourism development; tourism economics

The performance of Islamic banking loan growth is examined from three different perspectives—political regime and institutions, governance and political risks in both regime settings. Results suggest that loan growth is positive and significant in democratic regimes where political and civil rights are predominant. In addition, loan growths are slower during election years but higher throughout pre-election year in democratic regimes, suggesting the opportunistic behaviour of incumbent government artificially boosting the economy in preparation for the upcoming election. It is also found that the good quality of public services, policy formulation and implementation, and credibility of government's commitment to realizing the policies are vital in ensuring positive loan growth. The lack of differences in the reaction of loan growth to the governance in democratic and autocratic regimes shows some convergence in the regimes despite having significantly different political perspective. This implies that political commitment of the ruling government is vital to set forth a strong and robust Islamic banking standing regardless of its political standpoint. © 2020 The Authors.

As volatility proxies, we use regime-switching conditional volatilities, obtained from two-states MS-GARCH model. In order to determine the level of this effect in different market conditions and in different time-horizons, we combine wavelet methodology with the quantile regression approach. Our results indicate that the volatility spillover effect is not particularly strong across the countries and the wavelet scales, except in those conditions when stock market volatility is exceptionally high. Also, the wavelet-based quantile parameters report that the volatility transmission effect gradually subsides with the flow of time, and it applies for the majority of the indices. Romanian BET index experiences the strongest volatility spillover effect from oil in conditions when Romanian stock market is under extreme stress. The reason for this finding probably lies in the facts that Romania is the largest oil and gas producer among all CEECs, and oil and gas markets tend to comove strongly. Based on findings of wavelet quantile parameters and wavelet correlations, we can conclude that hedgers and portfolio managers can build their portfolio strategies, combining Brent oil futures with the CEE indices. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",oil; regime-switching volatilities; stocks; wavelets; “meteor shower” effect,Europe; Matthiola; assessment method; future prospect; oil production; price dynamics; spillover effect; stock market

With the gradual liberalization of China's exchange rate system, shocks from the renminbi markets contribute more to fluctuations in almost all individual Asia Pacific currency markets vis-à-vis the yen. Rolling regressions show a number of Asia Pacific currencies exhibit tighter association with the renminbi when the latter underwent exchange rate regime reform.

Building on Hofstede's four culture dimensions, we examine the direct and indirect links between national culture and investment inefficiency by considering the mediating role of Corporate Social Responsibility performance. Our study sample comprises of firms registered and remained list on the stock exchanges of 12 different Asia Pacific countries over the period of 2006–2016. To test the pathway in which national culture act on investment efficacy, Sobel intermediary factor test method is used to analyse the intermediary effect. We provide evidence that high degree of individualism, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity significantly reduce investment inefficiency. We also show that these variables decrease firm investment inefficiencies mainly through the increased CSR performance. In contrast, our results suggest that higher power distance increases the investment inefficiency of firms through declines in CSR performance.

Using nonlinear unit root tests, we find strong evidence in favour of the sustainability of Turkish current account deficit after taking into account both the smooth structural break and asymmetric speed of adjustment towards mean values. The core of our conclusion is twofold: first, we find that current account deficit is sustainable for Turkey in the analysed period; and second, sustainable current account deficit increased to around 5% of GDP in Turkey after the smooth structural break. Our results point out that current account deficits about 5% of GDP are sustainable if current account deficits permit greater FDI inflows and long-term external borrowings that much more oriented towards productive activities in the economy. However, if domestic investments are mainly financed by short-term external borrowings, then running current account deficits around 5% of GDP in the long run may generate inherent problems. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",sign nonlinearity; size nonlinearity; smooth structural break; sustainability; Turkish current account deficit,Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo; Trachinotus falcatus; balance of payments; econometrics; Gross Domestic Product; investment; nonlinearity; structural adjustment; sustainability

In particular, 79 2-digit NACE Rev.2 sectors across the UK manufacturing and services industry over 2008–2017 are taken into account in order to observe markup cyclicality and whether pricing decisions are significantly influenced by the degree of competition and liquidity restrictions. A panel VAR framework is used to take into account the presence of cross-section dependence and heterogeneity amongst the regressors of the model. The empirical results provide the following significant insights: (a) the markup ratio across the UK sectors follows a countercyclical pattern, (b) concentrated sectors tend to charge countercyclical price–cost margins as they attempt to increase their market share in normal periods and (c) sectors with liquidity constrained firms charge countercyclical markups in order to substitute lack of funding with additional revenue. Complementary findings also suggest that more profitable firms charge procyclical markup ratios, thus validating predatory pricing strategies in more concentrated sectors. © 2020 The Author.

These core findings matter more for the non-financial sector, during non-crisis years, and in developed financial markets. We also report that the deals have higher tendency to be withdrawn if the target firm's size is larger or its profitability is lower; and the acquiring firm's size is smaller. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that deal characteristics (i.e., deal attitude, means of payment, deal size, ownership sought) also matter in affecting the outcome of announced M&A deals. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",deal failure; economic freedom; firm size and profitability; institutional environment; mergers and acquisitions,data set; financial market; firm size; merger; profitability

The required data to calculate different constituents of IC efficiency and governance mechanism is hand collected from 512 annual reports. After controlling for other corporate governance and bank-specific characteristics (operational type, bank size, listing status, risk, type of auditor, accounting standard and region), we find both intellectual capital efficiency and shariah governance proxies (size and dominance of prominent scholars of shariah supervisory board) to have a significant positive relationship with accounting measure of performance. However, based on market performance measure, only one proxy for shariah governance mechanism, that is, prominent scholars on SSB, is found to be significant but in the negative direction.

Moreover, we find that sentiment factor can better explain the variation of excess returns than size factor and book-to-market factor do at the same frequency, and thus we should pay more attention to the individual effect of investor sentiment in the short-term decision-making.

In this paper, we exploit the 2008–09 contractions in credit supply in a quasi-natural experiment to examine whether financial conservatism affects firm value. Using a large sample of firms from seven African countries over the period 2003–2012, we find strong evidence that financial conservatism mitigates the adverse effect of contractions in credit supply on firm value for both local and international firms. Our results suggest that financial conservatism is an effective strategy for managing risks arising from contractions in credit supply and international business exposure. These findings provide novel empirical evidence on the value relevance of financial conservatism which shields firms from the adverse and far-reaching effects of contractions in credit supply. © 2020 The Authors.

Time-varying effects and structural change of oil price shocks on industrial output: Evidence from China's oil industrial chain,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089143927&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1970&partnerID=40&md5=208a0e5469fda7590c92f0236f4d439e,"Based on the output data of the oil industry chain from February 2006 to June 2017, we construct a time-varying parameter structural vector auto-regression with stochastic volatility (TVP-SVAR-SV) model and specifically analyse the time-varying effects and structural change of oil price shocks on China's output at each stage of the oil industrial chain. The results show that the effects of oil price shocks on output from upstream to downstream in the oil industrial chain are time-varying, and the dynamic impacts vary under different lag lengths. The increase in oil price driven by oil demand shocks is the major factor affecting output at each stage of the oil industrial chain. In addition, there is a structural change in the impacts of oil price shocks before and after the international financial crisis. With the decline in external demand and the implementation of policies to expand domestic demand, the responses of China's output at each stage of the oil industrial chain to oil price shocks have decreased significantly since the international financial crisis. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",oil industrial chain; oil price shocks; speculative demand; structural change; time-varying effects,China; financial crisis; oil industry; oil supply; policy implementation; price dynamics; stochasticity; vector autoregression

The empirical findings, based on a sample of U.K. listed firms for the period 1989–2013, indicate that, the higher persistence of the cash component of earnings is entirely attributable to cash distributions to equity holders and that investors fail to anticipate this higher persistence, leading to significant mispricing. Cash distributions to equity holders appear to have a positive relation with future returns. Furthermore, we show that the positive effect of the cash subcomponent related to equity financing activities on future earnings and stock price performance, is highly attenuated across profit firms, and becomes more severe across loss firms. Overall, our findings lend support to the earnings fixation hypothesis in explaining the pricing implications of the cash component of earnings on future stock returns. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",cash flows; earnings; persistence; U.K.; valuation,United Kingdom; financial system; industrial enterprise; profitability; stock market
Examining the causal relationship between globalization and energy consumption in MINT countries: Evidence from bootstrap panel granger causality,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088285484&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1884&partnerID=40&md5=4a8f61f77bf64a51b725f707514a05cc,"This paper examines the causal relationships between globalization and energy consumption for MINT member countries (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey) over the period 1970–2015, while controlling for the effect of gross domestic product. To control for common unobserved shocks and country-specific heterogeneity inherent in panel data analyses, we employ the cross-sectional augmented ADF and IPS tests to confirm the panel stationarity properties. We test for causal relations at country and panel levels through the Emirmahmutoglu & Kose, Economic Modelling, 2011, 28(3), 870–876 panel causality test for heterogeneous mixed panels. The causality results show that globalization is strongly related to energy consumption in MINT countries. Specifically, at the country level, we detect feedback causality between globalization and energy consumption in Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey, and find unidirectional causality running from globalization to energy consumption in Mexico. At the panel level, we also detect feedback causality between both variables. In general, our results lend credence to previous findings on globalization-driven energy consumption hypothesis for MINT countries.

Large fluctuations of China's commodity prices: Main sources and heterogeneous effects,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088703110&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1894&partnerID=40&md5=c4b079b8dc7260ed868fde9540f5e3b0,"Assuming that the economic variables obey the normal distribution, existing studies often use traditional mean models to explore commodity prices. In fact, the distribution of economic data is often skewed. When the economic data is left-biased or right-biased, the quantile regression can more fully characterize the distribution of economic variables, and thus obtain a comprehensive analysis result. Moreover, the coefficient estimates of the quantile regression are more robust than those in the ordinary least squares regression. Therefore, this paper uses the quantile regression method to investigate commodity price fluctuations. The results show that the money supply has a greater impact on commodity prices in the lower 10th and 10th–25th quantile groups. Among all quantile groups, the impact of international oil prices on commodity prices in the upper 90th quantile group is the highest. The effect of the exchange rate in the 25th–50th quantile group is greater than those in other quantile groups. However, the real economy has a minimal impact on the 25th–50th quantile group. Thus, the heterogeneous effects of these influencing factors should be taken into consideration when stabilizing commodity prices. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",commodity price fluctuations; driving forces; quantile regression approach,China; commodity price; economic impact; exchange rate; oil supply; price dynamics; regression analysis

Our results support the presence of time-varying co-movement and volatility spillover from gold and oil to Turkish sectoral stock market. The investigation of volatility has shown that shocks are highly persistent in the long run for all sectoral indices. Furthermore, our results indicate that volatility spillover from international commodity to sectoral indices vary significantly. Results imply that Turkey needs dynamic macroeconomic policies to manage the spillover effects of volatility.

This paper departs from the existing literature by investigating the relationship between CG structures and both financial performance (FP, measured as return on assets (ROA) and equity (ROE)) and non-financial performance, measured as league points won (NFP-Points), of sports organisations with specific focus on UK premier leagues' football (soccer) teams. We collect data relating to CG structures, FP and NFP-Points of football clubs playing in the four UK premier leagues in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales along with the English Championship teams over the 2011–2016 period. We analyse our data relating to 80 football clubs over a 6-year period (generating 397 club-year observations) by running a number of multivariate analyses to test our hypotheses. Our findings are as follows. First, we find that NFP-Points is higher in clubs with larger boards, non-executive directors (NED), CEO role duality, and higher percentage of foreign and/or younger directors, but lower in firms with higher percentage of female directors. Second and by contrast, we find that the relationship between these same set of variables and FP is, however, insignificant except for boards with NED that remained significant and negatively related to ROA. Our findings appear to reflect the prioritisation of on-the-field performance over off-the-field performance by sports organisations. Our evidence is largely robust to using alternative measures and estimation models. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",corporate governance and performance; economics and finance; football/soccer; popular sport organisations; premier league; UK,England; Northern Ireland; Scotland; United Kingdom; Wales; corporate strategy; finance; multivariate analysis; performance assessment; sport
The response of precious metal futures markets to unconventional monetary surprises in the presence of uncertainty,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088449347&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1885&partnerID=40&md5=6335c5ea0dbcc7e9c41ddd0f68b7d168,"This article examines the relationship between the unconventional monetary policies and precious metal futures markets by employing an asymmetric conditional volatility specification. The results suggest that the Fed announcements that likely induced lower long-term yields on average led to significant increases in the returns, while the effect of the ECB's unconventional monetary announcements is much weaker. Also, monetary policy surprises from both Fed and ECB have larger effects on gold return volatility. Moreover, while there are no asymmetric return responses to positive and negative surprises embedded in the monetary policy from the Euro zone, the return reactions of price returns to surprises in Fed's announcements exhibit asymmetry. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the volatility reactions are limited to negative surprises. Finally, we find evidence that the response of gold price changes to monetary announcements by the Fed becomes weaker in the presence of monetary policy uncertainty. We show also that the response of precious metal returns hinges on the sign of the unexpected component of Fed announcements. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",ECB; Fed; precious metal prices; monetary policy surprises; uncertainty,Europe; econometrics; European Union; market system; monetary policy; numerical model; policy implementation; uncertainty analysis

Furthermore, there is evidence that the intensity of overshooting is lower than the short-selling borrowing fee, for both U.S. and Brazilian markets.

However, model selection and lag lengths are important decision criteria for practitioners when undertaking technical analysis. This research explores the impact of varied lags and different model structures on one-day-ahead forecasts of AUD/USD and AUD/EUR exchange rates. Two linear (MLR and SVR with linear kernel) and three nonlinear (SVR with RBF kernel and three gamma values) data mining models are adopted, along with lag lengths of 1, 5 (1 trading week), 10 (2 trading weeks), 20 (1 month) or 120 (6 months) days for both non-differenced and first-order differenced time series. The investigation highlights that, irrespective of estimating the magnitude of future exchange rate or the future inter-day changes in exchange rate, linear models outperform nonlinear models at lower lag levels (1 or 5 or 10 days). At higher lags (20 or 120 days) and for the first-order differenced time series, nonlinear models show promising outcomes. The MLR model, which emphasises training error reduction, generally outperforms the SVR model, which emphasises generalisability. Nonlinear models may show some prediction biases, while linear models appear to show no specific bias. Thus, for technical analysis upon AUD/USD and AUD/EUR exchange rates, instead of using a large lag of historical prices, a linear model with a lag length of 1 can produce good one-day-ahead forecasts. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",exchange rate; lag selection; linear model; nonlinear model; one-day-ahead forecasting; support vector regression,algorithm; data mining; exchange rate; forecasting method; model validation; prediction; time series

This paper studies the effects of the SH–HK–SC and SZ–HK–SC programs on the co-movement between the Mainland Chinese, Hong Kong and U.S. stock markets in terms of dynamic conditional correlation by the t-copula–DCC–GARCH model. We find that both programs do not substantively enhance the daily price co-movements among the examined markets for all pairs except the Hong Kong–U.S. pair. The combination effect of the programs significantly enhances the weekly price co-movements between the Mainland Chinese and Hong Kong, or U.S. stock market after the SZ–HK–SC program, with an insignificant effect on the Hong Kong–U.S. pair. Although the multiple breakpoint tests for the daily data and weekly data exhibit somewhat different results, the structural breakpoints of the dynamic correlation coefficients among the stock markets easily appear during the subprime crisis. Some possible explanations are provided for the results, and correspondent suggestions are given for investors and policymakers. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",co-movement; Shanghai–Hong Kong Stock Connect program; Shenzhen–Hong Kong Stock Connect program; stock market,China; Hong Kong; Shanghai; United States; capital formation; capital market; correlation; financial market; investment; policy making; stock market
Mapping US presidential terms with S&P500 index: Time series analysis approach,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088402654&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1887&partnerID=40&md5=fbe3eee6655dfe7b7803c30edc0e0561,"This paper maps the US presidential terms with price dynamics in US stock markets by focusing on the S&P500 index. Fractional integration techniques, which are more general than other standard methods, are used and the results obtained produce interesting findings. It was found that during the second presidential terms, S&P500 stock market is less efficient and present higher degrees of persistence in its volatility. This is observed independently of the political affiliations of the president in power. The volatility, in general, reflects the spillover of economic excesses at the end of the first presidential term when seeking re-election into the second term in office. Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies at the end of the first term may create disequilibria in the economy which are amplified in the second term through a transmission mechanism resulting in contractionary interventionist policies in a situation where no incentive for re-election exists by the incumbent. The existence of stock's price cycles as induced by US presidential terms contradicts market efficiency theory but this helps investors decisions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",democratic party; fractional integration; republican party; stocks; US presidential terms,United States; Matthiola; democracy; financial crisis; fiscal policy; investment; monetary policy; party politics; political economy; stock market; theoretical study; time series analysis
Do Chinese listed corporations really tell the truth?

First, we construct a signalling game among listed corporations and investors. We obtain the behaviours, which are positive strategic interactions on the amounts of stock issue and positive correlation between stock issuance and profit, of listed corporations when they provide untrue information. Second, by using the dataset of 2,408 listed corporations in 2016 from CCER China Economic and Financial Database, we prove that the optimal amounts of stock issue by maximizing the amounts of financing increase as the profits of listed corporations raise. And by applying single index estimation method, our parameter estimation results show that the strategic interactions among 2,408 Chinese listed corporations on the amounts of stock issue are positive. Therefore, there exists Chinese listed corporations who do not tell the truth in proving their information. Further analysis shows that 485 out of 2,408 Chinese listed corporations do not tell the truth in providing their profits. And most of the Chinese listed corporations with unauthentic declared profits report their profits lower than their true profits to reduce tax. And those who overstate their profits are large and medium enterprises from the first and second industries. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",behaviours; financial fraud; listed corporations China; semi-parametric estimation,China; corporate strategy; correlation; database; financial market; financial system; investment
Oil and currency volatilities: Co-movements and hedging opportunities,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088363366&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1911&partnerID=40&md5=c0ae7f8dfba437f0212ebf081388571f,"The current literature concentrates its attention to the interactions between oil and exchange rates, focusing only on the first moments. Extending this line of research, we investigate the time-varying correlation between the volatilities of two oil benchmarks (Brent and WTI) and six currencies of the major oil-importers and oil-exporters, for the period from February 1, 1999 to May 30, 2016, using a Diag-BEKK model. The optimal portfolio weights and hedge ratios for portfolios comprised of the aforementioned volatilities, are also examined. The analysis reveals that oil and currency volatilities exhibit positive correlations during major global or region-specific economic events (such as the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2009 and the EU debt crisis period). By contrast, country-specific events yield heterogeneous time-varying correlations between oil and the different currencies in our sample. Both the optimal portfolio weights and optimal hedge ratios estimations demonstrate a time-varying behaviour, suggesting that continuous portfolio rebalancing is necessary for diversification purposes. The findings also show that risk reduction based on the optimal portfolio weight strategy is primarily beneficial for oil volatility investors, whereas currency volatility investors achieve better hedging using the optimal hedge ratio strategy. © 2020 The Authors.

Modelling demand and supply of Islamic banking deposits,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088592819&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1936&partnerID=40&md5=3f369d586b92b6ececb5116b00fb596b,"The purpose of the study is to assess the market of Islamic banking deposits. As banking intermediation ensures efficient allocation of excess capital, but stable availability of deposit resource helps banks to manage long-term capital structure portfolio. Unlike conventional banks, Islamic banks also have to meet the Shari'ah requirements. This study works under the domain of Islamic economics and intends to explore the demand and supply model of deposits of Islamic banks using data from financial statements, World Development Indicators and Thomson Reuters. The results using panel feasible generalized least squares model with two-way fixed effect showed that deposits are supply-elastic and demand-elastic with respect to returns to deposits. While other factors like inflation, money market rate and knowledge significantly affect supply of deposit and banking profitability and Islamic financial development significantly affect demand for deposits. This study concludes that the global Islamic banking deposit market is stable and converging hence, banks must ensure their relationship with price while devising a strategy to attract deposits. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",convergence; deposit market equilibrium; Islamic banks; panel FGLS; price elasticity,banking; convergence; demand elasticity; financial market; general equilibrium analysis; Islamism; least squares method; supply chain management

Furthermore, the generalised spillover index is proposed to examine the effects of return and volatility spillovers among INE, WTI and Brent futures markets. The results reveal that: firstly, during the sample period, INE is not yet a promoter of international benchmark crude oil prices, but more obvious followers. Secondly, although INE has begun to display the price discovery function, it is weaker than that of Brent, and the risk transfer function between them does not appear strong. Finally, INE market mainly acts as a net transmitter of return spillover before August 2018, but it has almost always been the net transmitter of volatility spillover during the full sample period. These findings are of interest to policy makers as well as investors for risk hedging and asset allocation of crude oil portfolios. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",INE crude oil market; price discovery; return spillover; risk transfer; volatility spillover,China; crude oil; frequency analysis; future prospect; market conditions; price dynamics; risk assessment; spillover effect
Economic growth in China and its impact on international commodity prices,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087623167&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1933&partnerID=40&md5=6975baae2eeb02919160f4a26e259363,"Since the turn of the century, China has experienced economic growth that has called for rapid industrialisation, infrastructure growth and urbanisation, making China highly dependent on primary commodities. The resource intensive growth path followed by a slowdown in recent years has raised the question to what extent her demand for commodities can affect international commodity prices. To this end, recent studies have analysed the link between economic growth or slowdown on commodity prices using linear multivariate models. However, a problem is that commodity prices are known to be highly variable and characterised by multiple structural changes. With such characteristics of the data, it is likely to be the case one may obtain mis-specified inferences from a linear multivariate framework. Accordingly, we make use of novel Flexible Fourier Form (FFF) econometric procedures to account for multiple breaks in the economic variables, which have better power and size properties over the standard linear models. We find that the persistence of economic variables employed in this study and their causal link are better approximated by such nonlinear FFF procedures. Our results show that there is evidence of short run predictability between selected commodity prices and economic growth in China. Further, the responses of different commodity prices to shocks in economic growth are quite profound especially for those cases where we find causal links with economic growth in China. While we find a significant impact of economic growth of China on commodity prices, the response varies for different commodities. © 2020 The Authors.

To EMU or not to EMU: Can TFP “provoke” the capital structure puzzle of SMEs?,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088819128&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1923&partnerID=40&md5=8ea2f9ecfda2df9ca331d1e4e3d65e44,"This article investigates the influence of the macroeconomic environment on corporate leverage. Using panel data of European listed SMEs, we examine the relationship between capital structure and country-level total factor productivity (TFP), GDP growth, interest rates and stock market development across firm categories (micro, small, and medium) and monetary regimes (EMU and non-EMU countries) for the period 2005–2015. By performing a dynamic panel data analysis into a vector error correction framework, along with several model specifications and robustness tests, we provide new evidence that country-level TFP is an important determinant of capital structure choice, while its impact depends on the institutional environment (inside the EMU or not). Although there are both short-run and long-run dynamic relationships between the corporate leverage and the macroeconomic factors, to EMU or not to EMU is also evident when looking at the three size categories. Overall, our results suggest that all SMEs are not the same, and the determinants of their capital structure vary across size categories. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",capital structure; panel data analysis; SMEs; total factor productivity; vector error-correction model,Europe; capital; data set; Gross Domestic Product; panel data; small and medium-sized enterprise; total factor productivity

The literature suggests that the evolution of government bond yields depends on three main risk drivers, namely credit risk, global risk aversion and liquidity risk. We estimate three equations for the 10-, 5- and 1-year Portuguese government bond yields, including eight independent variables (macroeconomic performance, fiscal conditions, foreign borrowing, the inflation rate, labour productivity, the demographic situation, global risk aversion and liquidity risk) to take into account all three risk drivers referred to in the literature. Our results show that there are no significant differences in the determinants of the Portuguese government bond yields among the different maturities, either in the long term or in the short term. Our results also confirm that all three of the risk drivers have exerted a strong influence on the evolution of the Portuguese government bond yields. Liquidity risk, foreign borrowing and the inflation rate are the main triggers of the rise in the Portuguese government bond yields, which does not counterweigh the beneficial effects played by the fiscal conditions, labour productivity and demographic situation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",ARDL model; credit risk; global risk aversion; government bond yields; liquidity risk; long-term and short-term determinants; Portugal,Portugal; demography; econometrics; empirical analysis; inflation; labor productivity; risk assessment

Fund-style shifts may deviate pension funds from their original risk profile and expose participants to undesired results. Nonetheless, these shifts may be the result of an active management to adapt to market cycles. Financial literature usually points out the policy-allocation importance versus the active management in explaining fund returns; however, we find significant relation between them. Our results show that managers vary their portfolios to add value, avoid the constraints of preserving consistent styles, and adapt to market conditions. Participants do not negatively react to style changes because top shifter funds are run by skillful managers and outperform. Nevertheless, managers must be aware of their limitations and the risk taken with this strategy. Poor skilled managers do not successfully implement style-shift strategies, especially in crises. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",active management; cycles; selectivity; skill; style shift; timing,United Kingdom; crisis management; economic cycle; financial crisis; financial policy; management practice; pension system; strategic approach

We find a positive and significant asymmetric relationship between oil prices and the trade balance in Brazil, India, China and South Africa. The asymmetries of wholesale prices also have a positive and significant effect on the trade balance in the cases of Russia, India and South Africa. The asymmetries of industrial production have a significant but negative impact on the trade balance for India and South Africa.

The effect of wealth on the choice of household drinking water sources in West Africa,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088459088&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1903&partnerID=40&md5=78a3a4400b9fa81ecc3bb694247f10d3,"Many developing countries are experiencing high population growth rates (an average of 2.7%). The increase in their respective populations leads to an increase in the need for drinking water. However, governments fail to provide the population with sufficient hydraulic infrastructure in terms of quality and quantity, with regard to the various priorities. In such situations, households take individual initiatives. However, the weakness of the available means may be a significant obstacle. This article seeks to identify the factors that determine the choice of household water sources in West African countries by putting an emphasis on the role of wealth. The study covers four countries, Burkina Faso, Mali, Ghana and Nigeria, and uses data from 28,444 observations from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and statistics agencies of the four countries being studied. When applied to the adjusted logit model, the data reveal that the higher the household wealth, the greater the chance of using piped water. There are also other factors, such as household size, the number of women and children, and the level of education that also determine the choice of water sources. These results suggest that governments need to increase their efforts to reduce inequalities between rural and urban areas in terms of improved access to drinking water and introduce a subsidy or fee policy to enable poor households to have adequate access to drinking water. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Channelized water; household; wealth; West Africa,Burkina Faso; Ghana; Mali; Nigeria; developing world; drinking water; household survey; rural-urban comparison; water planning; water resource
Which measure of systematic risk should we use?

The last two are derived by replacing variance with the Aumann-Serrano (AS) index and the Foster-Hart (FH) as the risk measure in MV-CAPM. We use the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index as a proxy for the market portfolio, and its component stocks to check if the systematic risks and the Treynor measures are different. The monthly return data from January 1997 to October 2017 are used for empirical estimations. The results show that the three systematic risks are highly correlated. Similarly, high correlation is also found for the three Treynor measures. It seems that even though they are derived under different risk measures, they produce almost the same systematic risk and performance measure for individual stocks. Therefore the findings of the present study suggest that any of the above measures can be used in empirical finance in the area of risk management. As this finding is different from those of other studies in the existing literature in this area, this study makes a contribution to the finance literature. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",AS-CAPM; asset pricing models; FH-CAPM; performance evaluation; risk measure; systematic risks,Matthiola; capital; empirical analysis; performance assessment; risk assessment

The results show that the mandatory adoption of IFRS has increased earnings timeliness of information in all banks. The assessment of cumulative effect on banks by incorporating single weighted index value (ET index) reveals that IFRS increased timely profit and loss realization of banks.

Using a panel VAR study as well as a comprehensive gender gap index and its sub-indices from the World Economic Forum, the study confirms the existence of bidirectional Granger causality between gender gap and economic progress, for OECD countries and developing countries. On the one hand, economic progress encourages equity for both sexes. On the other hand, gender equity helps developing nations prosper and significantly improve their human capital, which, in turn, drives long-run economic progress. By contrast, closing the gender gap negatively affects OECD output. For the sample of developing countries, the aforementioned results are robust to sub-indices measured by gender gap in economic participation as well as opportunity, educational attainment, and political empowerment. We recommend that gender policies specifically aim at eliminating gaps in female education. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",developing countries; economic progress; gender gap; granger causality; OECD countries; panel VAR,developing world; female education; gender disparity; Granger causality test; macroeconomics; OECD; panel data; regional economy; variance analysis

These results are in accordance with the traditional or revisionist views respectively. However, in the literature, there are also researches which result in interest rates not having influence on exchange rates, signalling that there might be an alternative to these two approaches. In this study, it is investigated whether interest rates can be cause of exchange rates by taking stock market into consideration and using the data of 2001 financial crisis in Turkey.

Unlike the previous studies which ignore the consideration of all quantiles of distribution, we employ a Granger causality in quantiles that captures causal links in each quantile of distribution. Hence we are able to disseminate between the causality in the median and the tails of the conditional distribution. Our findings indicate that there is a significant, negative causal relationship running from financial stress to economic activity in both countries. However, the changes in the financial stress level in Germany start influencing the industrial production earlier (when economic activity is at lower levels) than in the UK. Our results highlight the emphasis on the consideration of the entire conditional distribution to avoid the risk of misleading inferences on the causality analysis. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",financial stress index; Granger-causality; industrial production; quantile regression,Germany; United Kingdom; economic activity; finance; Granger causality test; industrial production; regression analysis

Nonlinear impacts of board independence on debt financing: Contingent on the shareholdings of the largest shareholder,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088815416&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1907&partnerID=40&md5=07c7e621c74528d8c02abfdb64482564,"Shareholder interest is unprotected until and unless precise financial decision making is in place. Although literature supports the independent directors' monitoring function in a decision-making process, for a controversial debt financing issue, the influence of the largest shareholders may hinder such an action. This study aims to delineate the association between board independence and debt financing when the largest shareholders are likely to play a significant role between them. With a sample of Vietnamese listed companies from 2007 to 2016, our regression analyses show that a nonlinear U-shaped relationship between level of board independence and debt financing is stronger among the largest shareholders with a high level of shareholdings in their shareholding group than the full sample. This finding implies the determining influence of the largest shareholders with a high level of shareholdings in a company. However, this association is not found in companies with a low level of shareholdings by the largest shareholders. Results reveal that the largest shareholders have the incentive to influence the decision making of independent directors about debt financing when their shareholdings are high. Specifically, issuing more debt to raise capital for business reduces the risk of the largest shareholders losing their controlling rights. The results are further supported by several robustness checks and controlling for economic events such as the global financial crisis and ASEAN Economic Community. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",board independence; debt financing; largest shareholders; nonlinearity; Vietnam,Viet Nam; capital; debt; decision making; financial services; incentive; nonlinearity; regression analysis

People live over two periods, investing and working in period 1, and consuming in period 2. In the financial market, some investors are informed about the fundamental stock value, while the rest are not, and trust their gut feeling (animal spirits). The informed investors are risk-averse, and the correlated animal spirits of the uninformed ones affects the stock market equilibrium thus producing an irrational bubble. We find that central bank's leaning against the wind policy is effective in controlling the bubble, if the uninformed investors discount their animal spirits anticipation of future dividends. Moreover, the paper shows that an irrational bubble may have similar effects on stock market prices as a rational bubble. © 2020 The Authors.

The results highlights that long-run trade complementarities are found between the trade of Pakistan and Sri Lanka, while short-run trade complementarities exist between India and Bangladesh, and between India and Sri Lanka. Pakistan and Bangladesh are found close trade competitors in South Asia in short run. The findings are important for policy implication which highlights how to bridge the untapped regional trade integration in South Asia.

We mainly utilize non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) approach and findings support an existing cointegration between the aforementioned variables. Our results also suggest that there is a bidirectional and negative relationship between US stock market performance and monetary policy uncertainty in the short-run. Furthermore, the effect of monetary policy uncertainty on investor sentiment is significantly negative and not strongly asymmetric in the long-run. On the other hand, in the short-run, increasing investor sensitivity to macroeconomic shocks strongly increases monetary policy uncertainty, while reducing sensitivity does not have a significant impact on the monetary policy uncertainty. Finally, we find a positive and bi-directional relationship between stock prices and investor sentiment both in the short- and long-run. In the long-run, decreasing investor sensitivity to macroeconomic fluctuations (becoming more optimistic) has a greater positive influence on stock prices than a negative influence on stock prices, since investors are becoming more pessimistic. Implications from our analysis are important to policy makers and investors for determining effective economic policy decisions and proper investment strategies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",asymmetric relationship; cointegration; investor sentiment; monetary policy uncertainty; nonlinear ARDL (NARDL); stock prices,United States; cointegration analysis; investment; macroeconomics; monetary policy; nonlinearity; performance assessment; policy analysis; risk factor; stock market; uncertainty analysis

Our key finding is that the sentiment-driven pricing of earnings will differ between the two periods. Specifically, during high-sentiment (low-sentiment) periods, the stock price sensitivity to good (bad) earnings news increases (decreases) with investor sentiment, whereas the stock price sensitivity to bad (good) earnings news is unrelated to investor sentiment. Additionally, we find that the effect of sentiment is more pronounced for young, high volatility, growth and distressed stocks. However, contrary to the U.S. evidence, our results show that small stocks are not always more exposed to sentiment. Further analysis of the role of short-sales constraints in the sensitivity of stock prices to bad earnings news implies that short sales can enhance informational efficiency. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",behavioural finance; China; earnings news; investor sentiment; short-sales constraints; stock market,China; Matthiola; growth rate; investment; price dynamics; sensitivity analysis; stock market

The outcomes of the study not only reported significant evidence of herding behaviour in Pakistan stock market over the entire sample period but also found it to be more pronounced under extreme market conditions, market volatility and financial crisis. Further, it was found that herding behaviour increases before the crisis, whereas decreases at the time of crisis. Fund managers and investors need to take herding behaviour in to account to evaluate asset prices and require a large number of stocks for achieving a correlation of inferior degree in portfolios and same degree in diversification. In addition, funds herding can be used as a signal of managerial quality. Moreover, as herding implies that fund managers and investors react to regulatory changes in a similar way, which may prevent asset prices from reaching their fundamental values and further causes financial markets to become fragile and destabilize, thus policymakers should take measures to control herding. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",CSSD & CSAD models; herding behaviour; KSE all share index; Pakistan stock exchange; state-space model,Pakistan; Matthiola; correlation; developing world; financial crisis; investment; market conditions; stock market; time series analysis

To this end, unbalanced panel data set for 124 countries covering the time span 1990–2015 is used applying the instrumental variable threshold regression approach. The estimated results highlight that embedded efficient institutional framework of a country assures more income equality with financial development. Moreover, GDP growth increases the income inequality if institutional quality is below the threshold level while educational attainment is a major factor to decrease it.

In fact, the benefit of financial hedging depends on diversification policies. By analyzing the interaction between financial hedging and corporate diversification in a theoretical model for a financially constrained firm, we find that focused firms have relatively higher marginal value of hedging in general static environment. However, dynamic analysis results show that an important synergy between financial hedging and diversification would reverse this result. Exercising corporate diversification policies has direct negative effect on liquidity and operating risk, thereby increasing the marginal value of financial hedging. As a result, it is possible that their relationship is complementary in a dynamic environment since these tools increase firm value in different channels. This suggests that firms could use financial hedging in the process of diversification if it is possible. Our findings also emphasize the importance of risk management capabilities which is hardly observable but contributes much to firm value. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",cash inventory; diversification strategy; financial hedging; integral risk management; synergy,corporate strategy; finance; risk assessment
Does financial development spur environmental and energy-related innovation in Brazil?,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088825837&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1873&partnerID=40&md5=13c1560e7cd2bac26edd1e1ba8b73c01,"There is a well-established set of literature on the energy-growth-finance nexus, especially for emerging economies; however, we identify two key gaps and address them in this study. First, the applied macroeconometrics literature suggests that macroeconomics time-series possesses a potential structural break(s) if not identified, which may result in large estimation errors. Second, although assessing the impact of financial development, the role of market capitalization and innovation have been ignored. Therefore, this study fills these gaps and incorporates the role of technological innovation and market capitalization on energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions in the presence of financial development, gross domestic product (GDP) and exports. Using extended time-series data over the period of 1980–2014 for Brazil, this study utilizes a structural break unit root test prior to autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to test the long-run equilibrium relationship amongst all the underlying variables. The ARDL results found that all of the vectors are cointegrated. Furthermore, long-run estimates validate the environmental Kuznet's curve (EKC) hypothesis for Brazil and conclude that exports are the key driver of CO2 emissions and energy demand in the country. However, financial development, market capitalization and technological innovation reduce the intensity of both the energy demand and emissions in the country. Causal analysis suggests that the exports increase financial development and innovation and in return, financial development and technological innovation decrease CO2 emissions in the country. The results are robust and useful for policy control use. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; EKC; financial development; market capitalization; structural break; technological innovation,Brazil; capital market; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; environmental economics; financial market; innovation; Kuznets curve; technological development

We examined a unique dataset of Chinese listed firms from the period of 2004–2014, and our findings are twofold. First, we find that the establishment of a staggered board in a company's article of association increases the equity financing costs as well as the debt financing costs. This result is in line with management defense hypothesis that staggered boards are an overprotection for the management. Second, our results show that a cumulative voting system plays an effective role in reducing the impact of a staggered board on a firm's financing costs. This moderating impact is higher for the debt financing costs and lower for the equity financing costs. The result shows that “debt investors” value a cumulative voting system because of its control of the corporate operations and board activities, while “equity investors” believe staggered board elections have a larger influence on the corporate governance. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",China; cumulative voting; debt financing cost; equity financing cost; staggered board election,China; corporate strategy; data set; debt; financial system; industrial investment; industrial structure; management practice; organizational framework

Empirical results also reveal that models incorporating volatility spillovers across metals are important for forecast combinations, and short-term spillovers have a stronger impact than long-term spillovers. This approach offers the best forecasting performance and allows users to identify the most dominant model at any given time and demonstrate when and how volatility transmission from another metal is valuable for forecasting.

Is human-capital investment necessary to modernization? The effect of rural polytechnic training in dual agriculture,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088825151&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1948&partnerID=40&md5=b84ebfdbbb3c0c46d067581139db3ed9,"In this paper we analyze the link between human-capital investment and agricultural modernization in a dualistic agricultural economy. We assume that human-capital investment in the context of agricultural dualism is distinct from that of simple traditional agriculture in that it gives top priority to developing the skills needed for production in the modern agricultural sector. Our aim is to investigate the likely consequences of investments and subsidies that provide polytechnic training to employees in the modern agricultural sector. To this end, we develop a three-sector general equilibrium model with which one can evaluate the effect of rural polytechnic training. Our research indicates that sector investments and government subsidies raise the output of the traditional agricultural sector but conditionally raise the output of the modern agricultural sector. Moreover, sector investments and government subsidies each have greater effects on the development of the traditional sector than they would on that of the modern sector. These, nevertheless, are not conducive to the agricultural modernization. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",agricultural modernization; dual agriculture; government subsidy; human-capital investment; rural polytechnic training,agricultural development; agricultural economics; agricultural research; agricultural technology; general equilibrium analysis; governance approach; human capital; investment; modernization; rural area; rural economy; training

Information content of insider filings after stock repurchase and seasoned equity issue announcements,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088871409&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1928&partnerID=40&md5=d5437a852975c17e77ff9fd236360b90,"This paper examines the information content of insider filings after stock repurchase and seasoned equity issue (SEOs) announcements. We find that when firms and insiders trade in the same directions, the absolute value of the market reaction to insiders' purchase filings after stock repurchase announcements is larger than that to insiders' sale filings after SEO announcements. Thus, although insiders' sale filings after SEO announcements still suggest that the stocks are overvalued, the signals may be less informative owing to the confounding effect of some insiders' liquidity needs. When the firms and insiders trade in opposite directions, insiders' purchases after a firm's sale dominate insiders' sales after a firm's purchase, since insiders' purchase always convey positive information about a firm's future. When the firms and insiders trade in the same direction, the abnormal returns following purchases (or sales) depend on the type of insiders who make the trade. The positive (negative) abnormal returns following purchases (sales) decrease in absolute value according to the category of insiders, which is consistent with the information hierarchy hypothesis. When firms and insiders trade in opposite directions, the results are similar, but the magnitude is weak. Based on our results, the insiders who are more familiar with the day-to-day operations of the firm would trade on more valuable information than other insiders. Although following CEO trades more closely results in CEOs trading more cautiously, CEOs face less litigation risk and trade more on their informational advantages after event announcements. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",insider's filing; nformation hierarchy hypothesis; seasoned equity issue (SEOs); stock repurchase; value stock,Matthiola; information; stock market; trade

Data on the firms and other macroeconomic variables spanning from 2006 to 2015 were sourced from Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) and Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) databases. We shed further light on the interaction between the two magnitudes considering the influence of the macroeconomic environment. The interaction is modelled in two separate panel multiple regression frameworks controlling for the fixed and random effects of the model estimators. LLC unit root test, normality test, collinearity test and Hausman test were conducted on the data prior to the estimation of the models. The study found that debt policy in the presence of market imperfections (tax effects) has statistically significant impact on firm value, but the effect is transmitted through either ROA or ROE, and that the macroeconomic environment is important in the debt policy-firm value nexus; as GDP growth and inflation respectively impacts positively and negatively on both stances of firm performance (ROA; ROE).We recommend that government's macroeconomic policy target tradeoff on economic growth and price stability should be in tandem with corporate management's objective to maximize firm value, and that institutional investors must diversify to minimize their exposure to negative inflationary effects and to take advantage of shifts in economic growth. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",debt policy; firm value; fixed and random effects; levered firms; market inefficiencies; panel data,Ghana; debt; financial market; financial policy; macroeconomics; panel data; regression analysis; valuation

Yet, research on the impact of financialization on income inequality, remains scant and inconclusive. Using data for 33 countries over 1996–2015, we provide evidence that of the three financialization dimensions - of the financial, nonfinancial and household sectors - only household financialization exerts a positive and robustly significant impact on income inequality. Re-estimations by system generalized-methods-of-moments (SYS-GMM) and difference-GMM as well as alternative income inequality measures, confirm the significant, positive impact of household indebtedness over all other financialization dimensions. Following disaggregation of household financialization into its three main components (mortgage, consumer and other purposes debt), we also uncover that it is increasing levels of household debt aimed at sustaining living standards that is accountable for the positive impact on income inequality, whilst mortgage debt reduces it. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",financial sector; financialization; household debt; income inequality; non-financial sector,capitalism; debt; empirical analysis; financial crisis; financial services; household income; living standard; wage gap
The impact of tunnelling on financial distress and resolution: Evidence from listed firms in China,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088577183&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1877&partnerID=40&md5=890d034f6c9ebe59facfd4131198aba2,"We examine the impact of tunnelling on financial distress in Chinese stock markets, where the agency problem is common due to the weak legal system protecting minority shareholders' interests. Investigating the widespread financial distress among listed firms during the time period 1999–2015, we find that tunnelling is a determinant of financial distress–tunnelling not only leading to financial distress but also prohibiting distress recovery. Regulatory improvements aiming to reduce tunnelling behaviour contribute to the resolution of financial distress, but there is still room to improve. Our results show that state ownership has limited influence on firm operation before financial distress but tends to benefit recovery from periods of distress, which depicts the market economy mechanism in China.

Incorporating asset price stability in the European Central Bank's inflation targeting framework,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087774550&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1891&partnerID=40&md5=b771cf53108ca5175e7428708d05364a,"We propose a new flexible inflation targeting index, the economic stability index (ESI), that could enable the European Central Bank (ECB) to implement more effective monetary policy for the euro area (EA). This index incorporates separately weighed house prices and stock prices. Furthermore, by weighting the housing sector in both normal and bubble events, it enhances the forecasting ability and accuracy of this new index. We demonstrate the resilience of this index using a range of robustness checks with multiple empirical methods. Our index that is equipped with these forward-looking variables enhances the ability to sense potential economic risks, whilst improving price stability and minimizing the output gap variance. This broader index may assist the ECB in addressing the challenges of the long-term decline of neutral interest rates in many EA economies and the weakening of the inflation/unemployment relationship under the Philips curve. The complexity of the ECB relationship with different fiscal authorities prevents any changes without significant structural variance. The ECB, however, can use a stabilization tool with enhanced foreseeability such as this ESI to improve stability without making significant structural changes. © 2020 The Authors.

Implied and realized volatility: A study of distributions and the distribution of difference,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088946440&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1922&partnerID=40&md5=5c691b398833f682f8f4c9cc813f275c,"We study distributions of realized variance (squared realized volatility) and squared implied volatility, as represented by VIX and VXO indices. We find that generalized beta distribution provide the best fits. These fits are much more accurate for realized variance than for squared VIX and VXO—possibly another indicator that the latter have deficiencies in predicting the former. We also show that there are noticeable differences between the distributions of the 1970–2017 realized variance and its 1990–2017 portion, for which VIX and VXO became available. This may be indicative of a feedback effect that implied volatility has on realized volatility. We also discuss the distribution of the difference between squared implied volatility and realized variance and show that, at the basic level, it is consistent with Pearson's correlations obtained from linear regression. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Beta prime distribution; implied/realized volatility; inverse gamma distribution; stable distribution; VIX/VXO,Indicator indicator; accuracy assessment; correlation; prediction; regression analysis; variance analysis
Can a small New Keynesian model of the world economy with risk-pooling match the facts?,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088557110&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1890&partnerID=40&md5=363cc77137c50a895a6071f3295a90cb,"We ask whether a model of the US and Europe trading with the rest of the world can match the facts of world behaviour in a powerful indirect inference test. One version has uncovered interest parity (UIP), the other risk-pooling. Both pass the test but the most probable is risk-pooling. This is consistent with risk-pooling failing a number of single-equation tests, as has been found in past work; we show that these tests will typically reject risk-pooling when it in fact prevails. World economic behaviour under risk-pooling shows much stronger spillovers than under UIP with opposite monetary responses to the exchange rate. We argue that the risk-pooling model therefore demands more attention from policy-makers. © 2020 The Authors.

The triple (T3) dimension of systemic risk: Identifying systemically important banks,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097596327&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2386&partnerID=40&md5=a4a84f84668ab9909e5411420743dc01,"This paper proposes a new systemic risk measure based on a multi-way analysis. The systemic risk is composed of two different components: the time and the cross-dimension. The first refers to the accumulation of banking risk and its interaction with the business cycle, while the second concern, the high-level concentration of the specific risk on relevant financial institutions. Thanks to the three-way analysis, we can, on the one hand, estimate a new measure of systemic risk based on these both components, and, on the other hand, we can transparently identify the SIBs (systemically important banks). To this end, we have empirically evaluated and compared the marginal expected shortfall (MES), the SRISK measure and the conditional value at risk (CoVaR) based on a representative sample of Eurozone institutions listed on the stock exchange for the period from June 2005 to May 2018. Our results show how these systemic risk measures produce different systemic risk classifications for the same bank. The findings, therefore, highlight the fragility and structural dependence of these measures, which may not be used for the estimation of a stable rank. Applying three-way factorial analysis, we show how our measure gives a more stable score. Moreover, our index is the first one to be composed of both the cross-section and the temporal components, essential elements for a proper assessment of systemic risk. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",banking supervisor; composite Index; multi-way analysis; systemic important bank; systemic risk raking,banking; business cycle; risk assessment; stock market

The determinants of systematic risk: A firm lifecycle perspective,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090128033&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1834&partnerID=40&md5=5a9853b25e237e747ae9ef1639bbea82,"This paper investigates how systematic risk varies over the lifecycle of the firm. If market equity beta is determined by firm characteristics as the literature on the determinants of systematic risk holds, and if those characteristics change over the lifecycle of the firm following a definite pattern as firm lifecycle theory suggests, then market equity beta should change over the lifecycle of the firm following a predictable pattern. Our findings indicate that holding other determinants of beta constant, the coefficient of systematic risk tends to fall in magnitude following a nonlinear pattern as firm age increases. In addition, we find that the volatility of market equity beta also tends to fall over the lifecycle of the firm. We argue that our main variable of concern, that is, firm age, proxies for variables that have hitherto been omitted in the literature on the determinants of systematic risk. In particular, we maintain that firm age proxies for the mispricing propensity that young firms lose as they mature. This research is useful for both practitioners and researchers in that it may suggest ways to adjust empirical estimates of systematic risk. In addition, our results are important for research on beta forecasting as they show that the length of the stationary interval of betas is shorter for young companies, and therefore it is necessary to take into account this time varying characteristic in the estimation process in order to improve the beta forecasting. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",financial leverage; firm lifecycle; intrinsic business risk; mispricing propensity; operating risk; systematic risk,business development; econometrics; financial system; forecasting method; life cycle analysis; numerical model
Are bank risk disclosures informative?

Using one of the largest bank-level datasets collected from 12 Middle East and North African (MENA) countries over the 2006–2013 period to-date, our findings are as follows. First, we find that risk disclosures have a predictive effect on BCRs. Second, we find that the relationship between risk disclosures and BCRs is contingent on the quality of governance structures. Specifically, we find that the informativeness of risk disclosures on BCRs is higher in banks with larger board size, greater independence, higher government ownership, and better Shariah supervisory board, but lower in banks with greater block ownership, higher foreign ownership and the presence of CEO duality. The central tenor of our findings remains unchanged after controlling for a number of firm- and country-level factors, alternative risk disclosure measures, firm- and national-level governance proxies, different types of banks, and potential endogeneities. The findings have important implications for investors, especially bondholders, standard-setters, regulators, and central governments. © 2020 The Authors.

In so doing, we employed a time-varying structural vector autoregression framework which accounts for time variations (in coefficients as well as in the variance–covariance matrix of innovations) on the data from July 2000 to December 2016. Our key findings suggested that the easing of monetary and credit conditions, stable and stronger currency and economic growth have played a significant and positive role in the development of the stock market in Vietnam. Inflation shocks did have a negative impact which implied that in policy setting the price stability is very important for the financial stability in Vietnam. The Vietnamese stock market is also heavily influenced by the regional markets, as there is strong evidence of co-movement. However, it was also witnessed that despite having a similar direction of impact and co-movement, different markets have an influence of different degrees and intensity on the Vietnamese stock market. Lastly, we also witnessed that as compared to the Global Financial Crisis, the recent periods showed comparatively lesser responsiveness. This could be associated with the intensive reaction during the period of financial turmoil as well as with an increase in the stability of the Vietnamese stock market as it matures. © 2020 The Authors.

In this study, we re-examine the causality nexus between ICT infrastructure and domestic level of financial development in 19 selected countries in Africa using a frequency domain spectral causality test technique that corrects the weaknesses eminent in the existing studies. Our findings suggest that, for most frequency levels, ICT infrastructure and domestic level of financial development in several countries are completely independent confirming the neutrality hypothesis. This holds irrespective of the measure of ICT and finance. We also find evidence to support the demand-following hypothesis, supply leading hypothesis and feedback hypothesis at different time periods for the different countries under study. Given the findings, we argue that the causal relationship between ICT and financial development is not straightforward as suggested by the existing studies. In addition to indicator of ICT and finance, the extent to which countries' ICT infrastructure relates with their domestic financial sector development is contingent on whether the country is operating in the short, intermediate or long run. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",causality; financial development; frequency domain; ICT infrastructure,Africa; Indicator indicator; econometrics; financial services; financial system; frequency analysis; industrial development; industrial performance; information and communication technology; infrastructural development; numerical model; telecommunication

In particular, extrapolative expectations in asset pricing lead to more pronounced hump-shaped responses in the asset price and investment to shocks, and the model matches the degree of persistence observed in the asset price data significantly better than the alternative DSGE models considered here, which are the Smets and Wouters (2007; American Economic Review, 97, 586–606) model, including a variant of the model with pre-determined investment expenditures, and the Gilchrist, Ortiz, and Zakrajsek (2009; Credit risk and the macroeconomy: Evidence from an estimated DSGE model.

In the pension fund industry, experts point at two important reasons for the growing interest in alternative assets: historically low interest rates and trends in portfolio diversification. The aim of this article is to assess whether these factors actually have an impact on the investment behaviour of pension funds in alternative assets. For this article, we analysed the CEM Benchmarking Inc. database with pension funds from North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The empirical analysis includes 890 pension funds for the period 2000–2015. The results confirm that portfolio diversification trends play an essential role in the growing popularity of alternative assets, most probably because these assets allow the pension funds to optimize their portfolio structure.

We identify five distinct intervals, each one corresponding to a different exchange rate regime or reflecting diverse economic developments. First, we model conditional volatility by introducing a novel DCC-GARCH-Copula model (based on GARCH selection criteria). Then, we investigate conditional volatility connectedness employing a Bayesian TVP-(Pseudo)FAVAR model. This approach effectively refines existing measures of dynamic connectedness. Findings suggest strong co-movements that differ across regimes. In addition, the EUR becomes weaker following both the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the decision for the first Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece. Following the announcement of the result of the EU referendum the GBP eventually receives influence from the EUR. Results remain robust to a series of tests. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",connectedness; DCC-GARCH-copula; exchange rates; TVP-(pseudo)FAVAR,Greece; Bayesian analysis; currency market; economic development; European Monetary Union; European Union; exchange rate; financial system; structural adjustment
What drives the duration of credit booms?,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088306324&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1862&partnerID=40&md5=7cae0d42a09e3405c8696be640e10d1d,"This paper presents a new perspective on the study of credit booms by both examining what determines their duration and testing for relevant political features. The results from the estimation of a discrete-time duration model show that both the economic and the political environment influence the duration of credit booms. These events are found to last longer when: (a) the economy is growing faster; (b) levels of liquidity in the banking system are lower; (c) current account position deteriorates; (d) centre parties are in office; and (e) with coalitions/minority governments. Evidence of a political cycle in the duration of credit booms is also detected. Additionally, this study shows that credit booms that end up in banking crises last longer but this effect can be offset by a higher degree of Central Bank independence. Hence, a monetary authority that is not influenced by political pressures is essential to prevent the unfolding of credit booms into banking crises. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Central Bank independence; credit booms; duration analysis; ideology; political cycles,banking; central bank; credit provision; ideology; numerical model; political economy
Structure and dynamics of global capital and international trade: Analysis of the relationship between exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) from 2001 to 2006,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077911221&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1803&partnerID=40&md5=57cfdcf92c14f8f25e672a96a59e4245,"This article attempts to explore the empirical evidence for the linkage between exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) by examining its relationship with over 140 countries from 2001 to 2006. Through using the comprehensive bilateral cross-country panel exports and FDI data set for the first time, this article provides more insights about the relationships between exports and FDI with developed–developed country pairs as well as with developed–developing country pairs, respectively. By applying augmented gravity models, this article justifies that exports and FDI are complementary as previous studies posit. Furthermore, such complementary relationship is more positive and significant with developed–developing country pairs when compared to other combinations (developed–developed and developing–developing pairs). To be more specific, FDI from developed to developing countries promotes more exports, while FDI from developed countries to developed countries is less important in promoting exports. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",developed countries; developing countries; exports; foreign direct investment,capital; developing world; economic structure; export; foreign direct investment; international trade

The study primarily contributes to the literature on the EKC by (a) focusing on a sample of less developed countries (LDCs), (b) controlling for per capita GDP scaled by a factor of two (in logs), (c) controlling for lagged per capita GDP squared (in logs), and (d) controlling for per capita GDP cubed (in logs). The effect of environmental regulation on trade and FDI inflows evaluates the ‘Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH)’ across nations. The extended version of the EKC (EV-EKC) framework validates the population-based emission, generally known as ‘IPAT hypothesis’ where (I) is measured by air pollution (i.e. CO2 emissions), (P) is measured by population growth, (A) is measured by GDPpc, and (T) is measured by FDI inflows, trade, and energy demand. The study selected a panel of 24 LICs for the period of 2002–2016 for robust inferences. The results supported the inverted U-shaped EKC hypothesis under the new beta's transformation in panel econometric techniques. The results partially supported the ‘PHH’ where FDI inflows are significantly associated with the CO2 emissions; while trade openness is not statistically significant in the prescribed regression apparatus. Population growth decreases carbon emissions to support the ‘genius’ principle, which rejected the IPAT hypothesis, whereas energy demand increases carbon emissions across countries. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",energy led emissions; Environmental Kuznets Curve; FDI; IPAT hypothesis; low-income countries; pollution haven hypothesis; trade,capital flow; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; developing world; econometrics; environmental economics; financial system; foreign direct investment; Gross Domestic Product; Kuznets curve; low income population; policy approach; sustainable development; trade performance; trade-environment relations

The correlation coefficients between crude oil and the US dollar are negative at most of the time; however, the coefficients become positive in certain periods, such as 2013–2014 and 2017–2018. Furthermore, the negative correlations in high frequency intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), with a shorter time horizon, are weaker and display time-varying characteristics, whereas the correlation in low frequency IMFs, with a longer time horizon, are stronger and more static.

Stochastic hybrid decision-making based on interval type 2 fuzzy sets for measuring the innovation capacities of financial institutions,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078673318&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1805&partnerID=40&md5=4cb066d076f628cd1bc32f5136fdde7e,"This study aims to construct a hybrid decision-making approach to the stochastic evaluation for the innovation capacity of financial institutions. For this purpose, interval type 2 fuzzy DEMATEL-ANP is used for weighting the criteria and dimensions. Additionally, TOPSIS and VIKOR methods based on interval type 2 fuzzy sets are considered to rank the alternatives. The novelty of the study is to propose a set of criteria and dimensions of innovation capacity with the supported literature. Another novelty is to propose an extended method of DEMATEL-ANP by using interval type 2 fuzzy sets as well as an integrated method of interval type 2 fuzzy stochastic decision-making with the Monte Carlo simulation. The results indicate that organizational dimension of innovation capacities has the highest importance between the set of criteria and the state-owned banks have been more appropriate than both the private and foreign banks for generating the innovation capacities in the financial institutions. However, the analysis illustrates that stochastic decision-making models could provide more extensive results than the conventional methods including the expert priorities.

The results also indicate that, both in the U.S. and Europe, when partial coherencies are significant, the partial phase-differences consistently highlight a negative co-movement between the stock markets returns and their corresponding implied volatilities, with the implied volatility indices leading the stock markets for most of the time span and across all frequency bands at which the stocks and the fear indices have co-moved significantly.

Empirically, although the sovereign CDS level mainly reflects global risk, the information in the term premia of the sovereign CDS spreads reveals country-specific risk. Notably, the predictive power of the term premia is robust after controlling for the sovereign CDS level and other conventional global macroeconomic and financial factors.

It has also been established that rising national income has a positive impact on healthcare expenditure. Therefore, an empirical question is whether financial development increases healthcare expenditure for countries at all income levels. This paper examines the relationship between the level of financial development and healthcare expenditure from a global perspective for countries at different income levels for the period of 1995–2014. Common correlated effects mean group approach was employed to account for unobserved heterogeneity and cross-section dependence in the large panel dataset of 159 countries. Additionally, mean group and fixed-effects estimation approaches were used to measure the robustness of the relationship. The association was tested at different levels by sub-grouping countries based on their income. The results indicate that the relationship between financial development and health expenditure is positive and significant. However, the results fluctuate considerably across income levels. The association becomes trivial when income levels rise, with low-income countries showing stronger correlations. Rising incomes and public health expenditure, foster increasing expenditure on health more in countries with a lower level of corruption. Lastly, the statistical outcomes observed are subject to the choice of estimation techniques. Development in the financial sector influences per capita health expenditure positively, however, the association is more prominent for lower-income countries. Policies are proposed to direct the gains from financial development towards healthcare to maximize society's welfare. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",common correlated effects; cross-section dependence; financial development; global; health expenditure; panel data,economic development; financial market; global economy; health expenditure; income; panel data

We also find that the impulse responses of tail dependences to shocks to variables of interests vary significantly over the sample period. Our results also indicate that lower tail dependence, in particular, is found to have more than one breakpoint, and the break dates are highly associated with financial crises. In addition, we find evidence of asymmetry in tail dependence, which varies across periods. Finally, we find that tail dependence is persistent in the short-term but deteriorates as the duration increases. These findings have important implications for investors, risk managers and policy makers. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",oil prices; persistence; stock market; structural break; tail dependence,China; crude oil; financial crisis; price determination; stock market
Macroeconomic and financial implications of multi-dimensional interdependencies between OECD countries,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082970453&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1814&partnerID=40&md5=40a80dd15f800bcef384f201f0ab1d3c,"This paper uses a complex structure of factors of exposure to international shocks for the analysis of regional and inter-regional effects of a variety of financial shocks across Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies. Those factors (trade, finance, migration and others) are incorporated in a coherent and comparable scheme which, based on observed data, describes pair-wise, directionally asymmetric exposures to foreign economies in the sample. Through a global vector auto-regressive setting, a systemic approach characterizes our modelling by the means of which several standardized shocks are simulated varying the region of origin to compare their effects and spillovers. In the depicted map of risks, the shocks are of particular relevance to both wholesale and retail credit markets, stock and commodities markets and also for the management of monetary and fiscal policies in open economies. The diversity of responses between OECD regions is useful to understand the asymmetric impacts and degrees of relative vulnerability towards disturbances in international markets. A subset of Eurozone countries, for example, consistently shows significant sensitivity to foreign shocks. Other Eurozone countries experience a lower degree of imported volatility while Asia-Pacific appears to be more resilient to shocks in OECD regions. In turn, the significance of the impacts of shocks in the North American Free Trade Agreement region is large enough for them to be close representations of global shocks. © 2020 The Authors.

Testing and comparing conditional risk-return relationship with a new approach in the cross-sectional framework,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076443635&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1786&partnerID=40&md5=01fedd9219ee096ade959cf1ef2f14f3,"This paper presents an innovative approach in examining the conditional relationship between beta and returns for stocks traded on S&P 500 for the period from July 2001 to June 2011. We challenge other competitive models with portfolios formed based on the book value per share and betas using monthly data. A novel approach for capturing time variation in betas whose pattern is treated as a function of market returns is developed and presented. The estimated coefficients of a nonlinear regression constitute the basis of creating a two factor model. Our results indicate that the proposed specification surpasses alternative models in explaining the cross-section of returns. The implications of this study show that the proposed new risk factors that found to be significant both in time series and cross-section analyses provide valuable information in better understanding the characteristics of returns, targeting the reinforcement of stock market efficiency, and the capital allocation procedure. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",CAPM; cross-sectional regression; S&P 500,Matthiola; capital formation; comparative study; numerical model; regression analysis; risk assessment; risk factor; stock market; temporal variation; testing method; time series

Harnessing the explanatory powers of Wavelet analysis, we employ Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform to evaluate interdependence between contemporaneous futures and spot returns. We observe that price discovery between futures and spot markets at granular level is a scale-dependent phenomenon. Moreover, we record a counter-intuitive but not unprecedented evidence of futures market lagging the spot market in price formation. This discrepancy approaches convergence in 1–8 min. Our findings constitute evidence against the efficient market hypothesis and hint at opportunities for statistical arbitrage by high-frequency trading.

Do the macroeconomic factors influence the firm's investment decisions?

There exist the series of studies, which discuss the firm-level determinants of investment but very few studies have found the relationship between macroeconomic factors and corporate investment. So, with specific data set, this study is an attempt to fill this instant gap by exploring the relationship between macroeconomic factors and firm capital investment. GMM approach uses for estimation purposes. The results imply that increases in inflation rate decrease the investment due to increment in future cost of investment. Similarly, high interest rate decreases the corporate capital investment due to opportunistic options of early returns by investing in high interest income securities. The firms from high GDP growth countries carry higher investment level owing to business acceleration. However, the firms from high FDI inflow countries bear the low investment opportunities attributed to suppressed fierce competition. The countries having developed financial sector encourage their firms to invest more in banking securities instead of investing in physical long-term investment, that is, investment in fixed assets due to professional management of funds by financial institutions and low substantial risks. Briefly, the findings of the study recommend that the corporate managers should focus on economic sensitivity while making decisions about any potential investment. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Asian countries; corporate investment; generalized method of moments (GMM); macroeconomic factors,Asia; decision making; econometrics; industrial investment; interest rate; macroeconomics

The dynamic panel generalized methods of moments (System-GMM) methodology is employed to analyze data spanning from 2005 to 2014 for twenty (20) frontier markets by Standard and Poor's Indices. The study finds that human development is a catalyst for financial inclusion scale-up in the banking industry, which in turn, augments the development process. It establishes fresh evidence that income level, financial literacy, and healthy lives are the decisive factors for financial inclusion scale-up in the banking industry. It finds new evidence that the underlying cause of low financial inclusion is low human development. The study concludes that low human development causes low financial inclusion. Also, promoting financial inclusion through the banking sector is very instrumental to stimulating human development, thus the reverse applies in frontier markets. The study implies that low living standards, poor health, high illiteracy, and deprived well-being and freedom largely account for low financial inclusion hence its spillover effect of having low human development in frontier market countries. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",financial inclusion; financial literacy; frontier markets; human development; income; modern technology,banking; financial system; human development index; income; literacy; modernization

Contrary to the belief that commodity futures are sensitive to economic uncertainty, our results provide concrete evidence that uncertainty risk is not significantly priced. To explain these results, we examine whether financial intermediaries who are supposed to be marginal investors are not uncertainty averse. We find that the effect of economic uncertainty becomes insignificant after financialization, that is, a large inflow of financial investors, in 2004 and the relation between economic uncertainty and intermediaries' leverage ratio is insignificant. These results suggest that economic uncertainty might not be priced because it is not a significant concern of financial intermediaries. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",asset pricing; economic uncertainty; financial intermediaries; international commodity futures markets; uncertainty,capital flow; capital market; financial market; market system; uncertainty analysis
Forecasting the volatility of Chinese stock market: An international volatility index,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088389941&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1852&partnerID=40&md5=0bebd22ca3e14347f3856ade9bfc146c,"To forecast the volatility of Chinese stock market, we use information from 28 international markets rather than relying on the Chinese market alone. A common factor, which we call the international volatility index, is constructed by the first principal component of all the 28 cross-national stock market volatilities. We then add the international volatility index into the prevailing heterogeneous autoregressive model of realized volatility (HAR-RV). The in-sample estimation results show that the impact of this common index on future Chinese market volatility is statistically significant and positive. More importantly, the out-of-sample forecasting results suggest that our proposed model outperforms competing models including the HAR-RV, kitchen sink model, and combination approaches. The results are similar when we use a wide range of robustness checks. Furthermore, the international volatility index also yields the highest economic value from an asset allocation perspective. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Chinese stock market; economic values; international volatility index; principal component analysis; volatility forecasting,China; estimation method; forecasting method; market conditions; principal component analysis; regional economy; stock market

Four terrorism indicators are used, namely, domestic, transnational, uncertain and total terrorism. The empirical results are based on the two-step Generalized Method of Moments in system. Three key findings are established. First, all terrorist indicators affect negatively the formal economy and positively the informal economy. This effect may be due not only to the size and maturity of the African economy, but also to the adoption of less conservative public policies. Second, an aggregate analysis identifying the impact of terrorism on various macroeconomic variables sheds light on the impact of terrorism on the overall situation of the African economy. Third, compared to domestic terrorism, transnational terrorism more significantly and negatively affects the formal economy and positively affects the informal economy.

Unlike T-SVM, KFT-SVM can deal with the noises and outliners in dataset and the fuzzy dataset with a lot of potential uncertain but important factors in financial markets by introducing the fuzzy approach. More importantly, the introduced kernel method can aid the fuzzy approach to achieve more valuable fuzzy memberships by transporting dataset from the input space to the kernel space and further improve the generalization performance of T-SVM. Computational comparisons of KFT-SVM against SVM, T-SVM and FT-SVM indicate the significant superiority of our proposed KFT-SVM. Furthermore, we have investigated the favourable ability of KFT-SVM for overcoming the class imbalance problem by comparison with that combined with the resampling method of the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE).

Using a Markov-switching methodology on Tunisian market data, we find that expected and unexpected market illiquidity effects on Tunisian small-cap returns are always negative and stable. But for large caps, unexpected market illiquidity (illiquidity shock) effect on stock returns varies over time across two distinct regimes. In the first regime, illiquidity shocks have small effect on stock returns, whereas in the second regime, this effect rises threefold compared to its magnitude in first regime. The second regime (stress scenario) is short lived and characterized by high volatility. We also find that effect of expected market illiquidity on large cap returns is insignificant. In addition, we investigate the factors that lead to the stress scenario on stock exchange of Tunis. We find that stress scenario is contingent to funding illiquidity and economic distress in Tunisia.

Disturbances and instability in the banking sector may jeopardize financial stability and generate adverse, considerable and long-lasting consequences therefor. This study analyzed the dynamic and causal effects of various indicators of banking sector stability on economic growth by employing new generation panel cointegration and causality tests in post-transition European Union countries over the period 1998–2016. Taking into account cross-sectional dependence between countries, the presence of heterogeneity in the errors, endogeneity and structural breaks, the long and short run analyses revealed the cointegration relation between the variables, the statistically significant positive effect of banking sector stability on economic growth and the efficiency of the error correction mechanism. The causality analysis disclosed the opposite causality direction between the particular banking sector stability indicators and economic growth, suggesting that banking sector stability is a complex, hierarchically structured multidimensional construct. Its different dimensions require different policy responses aiming at preventing future shocks and mitigating the adverse effects, while encouraging economic growth. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Banking sector stability; economic growth; panel cointegration and causality analysis; post-transition EU countries; structural breaks,Europe; banking; cointegration analysis; econometrics; economic growth; economic instability; European Union; Granger causality test; market transition

Our results indicate quick responses in market rates to changes in policy rates; and incomplete long-run pass-through coupled with delayed impact and slow adjustment from market rates to retail rates; while the responses appear to be symmetric with respect to the direction of change of rates. Moreover, the positive impact of the State Bank's regime shift on the effectiveness of the interest rate transmission is another important finding of this study. These findings eventually lead to some suggestions on the possible measures to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",adjustment speed; asymmetric model; degree of pass-through; interest rate pass-through; policy change; regime shift; structural factors,Viet Nam; banking; exchange rate; financial market; financial system; interest rate; monetary policy

Our approach combines the hidden Markov regime-switching model with realized jumps, which allows us to examine the tail risk exposure of investors at different investment scales. Applying our method to data on bonds, stocks, and currencies, we find evidence that market risk linked to jumps exhibits time-varying regime shifts and horizon-dependence. We show that high-frequency trading does not contribute to market instability, as measured by jump risk. The European bond market appears to be more vulnerable to downside (left-tail) jump risk, relative to the U.S. Treasury bond market. Market jump fear embedded in the VIX exhibits vertical clustering where both risk regimes at low frequencies remain unchanged at higher frequencies. These results suggest that the premium for jump risk not only depends on stress periods, but also on the frequency at which investors trade financial assets. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",hidden Markov regime-switching models; high-frequency data; jumps; multiple investment scales; VIX; volatility,Europe; United States; Matthiola; currency; investment; Markov chain; stock market

Usually, this strategy takes into account the first- and second-order of Taylor series (Duration and Convexity). However, the model itself has risk because of the difference between the real and estimated value via duration and convexity approximation. Therefore, the aim of this article is to find a better immunization model avoiding the effect of unexpected interest rate shocks by adding more terms of Taylor series to an immunization strategy. As criteria of efficiency, the paper checks the effect of interest rate risk in several immunization models upon a 99.5% confidence level (risk level of 1 in 200 scenarios), as required by Solvency II in Europe, to determine a better immunization strategy. This work analyses the skewness and, consequently, the fitness of adding third- and fourth-order Taylor series.

Importantly, we find herding on and around the OPEC meeting days however this is only limited to a period of high global uncertainty that is, during the Global Financial Crisis period (GFC) of 2008–2010. However, when we filter out factor-based herding in the Saudi equities, we also find persistent herding in the post GFC period. These results are consistent when we assess the impact of OPEC meetings using event windows of one to 5 days before and after the announcement. In consideration of the crucial role of OPEC in determining the oil prices, we explain our results of Saudi market herding on and around OPEC meeting days for the prior announcement ambiguity and corrections before, on and after the announcements on global supply. Our results show that this tendency has originated during the GFC, has persisted in the post-GFC in the Saudi equities and surprisingly, is largely found absent in the periods when the Saudi equity market witnessed bullish market conditions.

This dispersion was an important manifestation of the “financial fragmentation” that hampered the smooth transmission of accommodative monetary policy. Using bank-level data from 2007 to 2015, we directly measure the borrowing cost dispersion across firm types by calculating the difference in the interest rate charged by the same bank in the same month for loans to small and large firms (the “Small Firm Financing Premium,” SFFP). We assess the role played by both bank and macroeconomic factors in explaining the variation in the SFFP across countries and through time. We provide evidence that bank market share, sovereign bond holdings, and balance sheet weaknesses led to disproportionate borrowing cost increases for small firms and exacerbated the impact of a weak macroeconomy during this period. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bank balance sheets; banking market concentration; cost of credit; SMEs,banking; credit provision; finance; fragmentation; interest rate; macroeconomics; monetary policy; small and medium-sized enterprise

This paper conducts an empirical examination with balanced panel data for 133 economies from 1980 to 2014. In the study, the impact of depreciation is dichotomized into common effect and individual effect. The results show that, first of all, the common effect is negative in the current period, and turns to be positive in the lag period, while the magnitude of the former is higher. Secondly, it is also revealed that in terms of individual effect, the negative impact of the common effect will be intensified by the degree of openness, but be mitigated by the scale, floatability, and development level of economies. Among them, scale has a decisive influence. Third, when putting the two tiers of effects together, the aggregate results are generally not strong; moreover, only a few economies can benefit from depreciation. The exceptions are the US and China, which can obtain approximately 0.58% benefits from a 1% depreciation.

An Agent-Based model for Limit Order Book: Estimation and simulation,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088109659&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1839&partnerID=40&md5=986ea5ca6f79c5e6c17ee4175ca22a96,"In this article, we introduce an agent-based model for a Limit Order Book (LOB) market with a price limit and simulate and estimate its parameters. In this framework, we have reached a linear relation between the percentage of the sellers in the market and the changes in the logarithm of the price. Moreover, we demonstrate that in this model if the supply and demand are equal and naturally if the demand is more than the supply, on the average, logarithm of the price strictly increases and this occurs while in the model argued, the inflation is assumed to be zero, no real factor exists in order to increase the value of stocks and no factor-like rumors enters. This conclusion implies that merely the normal activities of the dealers to gain profit causes a false increase in the stock price. This fact, as being demonstrated in the simulation, has also been proved analytically. We call this phenomenon “the intrinsic bubble”. Finally, we show that if the rules of the market change in the way that the daily price of the stock is calculated by the median of the prices traded, instead of their mean, this intrinsic bubble will more or less disappear. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",agent-based model; financial bubble; limit order book; market microstructure,Matthiola; computer simulation; estimation method; finance; market system; numerical model; parameter estimation; price determination
Finance and growth: Particular role of Zakat to levitate development in transition economies,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088591995&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1832&partnerID=40&md5=80699cc961937be27d01c59ca1a7f1c2,"Financial institutions in transition economies maintain higher liquidity at the cost of economic growth. This study offers an alternative policy tool to achieve higher liquidity without compromising economic growth. We show that Zakat—an obligatory Islamic charity with a fixed rate of 2.5%—can be an alternative to the interest rate and that its use as a policy tool promotes economic growth. Instead of considering zakat as a fiscal tool—an alternative to tax—we present it as a monetary policy tool to substitute the interest rate. We provide a framework based on the endogenous growth model, which allows the use of Zakat as a tool to overcome liquidity constraints in transition economies. We also construct an index-based varying zakat rate adjusted for economic fundamentals, such as economic growth, for each economy. We provide empirical evidence using system generalized method of moments (GMM) in a simultaneous equation model on a panel data of 38 countries for the period 1996–2015. The results show that zakat rate has a significantly positive impact on economic growth. Furthermore, as a policy tool, Zakat has a statistically significant positive impact on FDI and domestic investment, while reducing corruption (CR). The results are robust for various regions and income classifications in different transition economies. The overall findings corroborate that zakat can help achieve the dual objectives of enhanced liquidity and higher levels of economic growth. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",economic development; economic growth; financial and economic policy; financial institutions; panel data estimation,Polemonium caeruleum; economic development; economic growth; endogenous growth; estimation method; financial policy; growth modeling; panel data

The findings confirm the central hypothesis of the SCA model and provide evidence that profitability is linked to balance sheet items in Ghana. It also documents evidence that domestic banks have higher rate of return on assets than foreign banks over the study period. In addition, high profit banks were observed to have higher rate of return on assets as well as higher rate of cost on liabilities than low profit banks.

We conduct a Nowcasting exercise using the Google search intensity for the term «Drachma» and document that higher search intensity leads to higher Total deposits outflows, which are primarily driven by outflows in Time deposits. We also find that the Google search intensity for the term «Drachma» exerts an asymmetric impact across One-Day deposits and time deposits. In addition, the asymmetry is also present between firms' deposits and households' deposits. These findings support that ‘a flight-to-safety’ behaviour caused by uncertainty about the future currency accounts for the erosion of deposits in Greece. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bank deposits; depositors sentiment; Drachma; Google trends; Greek banking system; Nowcasting,Greece; banking; currency market; financial services; financial system; future prospect; nowcasting; trend analysis; uncertainty analysis
Market efficiency and volatility persistence of cryptocurrency during pre- and post-crash periods of Bitcoin: Evidence based on fractional integration,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088566856&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1851&partnerID=40&md5=fcdf2ccbc4d6c35b8dc5618f55bc3976,"This article investigates both market efficiency and volatility persistence in 12 cryptocurrencies during pre-crash and post-crash periods. The article contributes to the debate on the market efficiency of cryptocurrencies in the presence of volatility, considering robust fractional integration methods in both linear and nonlinear setups. We find that markets of Bitcoin and most altcoins considered in our study can be dubbed as efficient, and are also highly volatile, particularly, in the post-crash period that we are experiencing now.

Using newly developed data for disaggregates of governance with annual frequency between 1996 and 2014, this study pioneers in South Asian context. Doing so, this study incorporates dynamic panel data technique pool mean group estimation for robust and policy oriented outcomes. The empirical results show that three indicators of governance (control of corruption, accountability and rule of law) have a positive and statistically significant impact on stock market development. The results of long-run estimations are homogenous across the countries but, the short-run estimates, and the speed of adjustment towards the long-run equilibrium are found to be heterogeneous. It could be due to volatility effect of governance in each cross section country. From the policy perspective, the study concludes that the institutional quality and governance are the significant factors on market capitalization in the panel countries. The institutional factors (i.e., control of corruption, accountability and rule of law) support stock market development through high market capitalization, strengthens investor's confidence for long term investment in the countries. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Governance; panel ARDL; pooled mean group estimation (PMG); stock market development,South Asia; capital flow; capital market; economic development; financial policy; governance approach; panel data; performance assessment; stock market

We estimate models using a panel data set from unlisted firms in the United Kingdom from 2009 to 2014. With the use of a commercially available credit rating and a widely used index in the literature to proxy for external financial constraints, the paper concludes that less financially constrained firms display a higher investment-cash flow sensitivity. This association has been consistent across the post-global financial crisis period. We find some evidence to suggest that investment inefficiencies reduce investment-cash flow sensitivity, and this is intensified in the presence of external financial constraints. We extend the investment choice literature in the presence of financial constraints using evidence from unlisted firms. We also enhance the investment choice literature by incorporating the managerial entrenchment effect along with financial constraints. Provision of financial support for private entities is a crucial policy focus for any government. We call for policymakers to enhance microfinancing options for unlisted firms to reduce the impact from external financial frictions. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",financial constraints; investment inefficiency; investment-cash flow sensitivity; post GFC; unlisted firms,United Kingdom; financial crisis; financial services; investment; management; microfinance; panel data

Network-based early warning system to predict financial crisis,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076358770&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1806&partnerID=40&md5=4a58e18379cebdb8051a2b15b0997cb2,"In recent years, early warning systems have been developed as a significant tool to prevent financial and economic crises. In this paper, we applied the forward-looking conditional value at risk (COVaR) as a market-based systemic risk measure to analyse the systemic risk in an emerging market. A network representation of asset exposures is presented based on the values of ΔCoVaR. According to the exposure networks, two new network-based indices are introduced. Furthermore, regarding the dependence of the new indices on the values of forward-looking CoVaR, they are applied as the indicators for the proposed early warning system to predict downturns and crises in the level of firms and the whole market. The results of the early warning system for the market return show that the indicators based on both proposed models have a good ability to predict the crises in the market. In other words, the indicators issued a warning signal up to seven periods before the real crisis in the market. Similarly, the results of the early warning system to predict downturns at the level of firms also indicate the ability of indicators to issue the true warning signals. The results of the proposed system can help policymakers and authorities to determine the appropriate microprudential and macroprudential policies to avoid systemic risks. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",CoVaR; early warning systems; network theory; spillover risk; systemic risk,early warning system; econometrics; economic policy; financial crisis; network analysis; numerical model; policy making; spillover effect

To this end, we conduct a systematic comparative analysis of the determinants of the performance of the banking sector in periphery Eurozone countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain) versus banks operating in core Eurozone economies (Germany, France). We provide evidence that is consistent with the argument that banks financed with short-run capital market funding are more fragile. A further finding of our analysis shows that banks operating in countries which have a more restrictive regulatory framework on banking activities perform better. In addition, it is shown that the better-performing banks have more equity. Finally, the estimation of the appropriate dynamic models we argue that bank performance is affected by bank-specific determinants like equity capital and bank size, while the regulatory framework as well as macroeconomic variables play a crucial role. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bank fragility; banking sector performance; financial crisis,Europe; banking; core-periphery relations; financial crisis; industrial performance; macroeconomics; regulatory framework

We also propose and test a political stability threshold model that may trigger FI. We find that (a) political instability positively correlates with lower degrees of FI with higher levels of persistence; (b) higher incomes and higher education are associated with higher degrees of FI; (c) a lack of documentation required by formal financial institutions proves to be a major barrier to FI; and (d) inefficient mechanisms to determine real interest rates, corruption, oil reliance, unemployment, and religious tensions also negatively affect FI. Further, we calculate the political stability threshold level that will trigger FI to be -0.960 for the Middle East and North Africa region.

To investigate this proposition, we compare the influence of board gender diversity on firm risk-taking level in Indian high-tech and in non-high-tech sectors. Our findings indicate that female executives operating in high-tech sectors take more risk than their counterparts female executives who operate in non-high sector. Interestingly, our analysis also reveals that family ownership negatively moderates the impact of female executives on risk-taking in high-tech firms. In additional analysis, we find that female executives exert a positive impact on firm performance only in high-tech sector. This suggests that the influence of female executives on firm outcomes is not always straightforward. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",board gender diversity; high-tech sector; risk-taking; uncertainty,India; family structure; firm ownership; gender role; high technology industry; industrial performance; uncertainty analysis; womens employment; womens status

The framework of the fractal market hypothesis proposes a clear explanation of investor behaviour throughout a market cycle, including booms and busts. Nowadays, the importance and advantages of forecasting in decision and policy making from different dimensions are undeniably accepted. Naturally, the techniques that face the lowest forecasting errors are capable of survival and proper function. Successful structural models have not been recently employed in the field of forecasting; therefore, other tests have been proposed among which L-Co-R algorithm is the most notably known for time series analysis. The present study applies L-Co-R coevolutionary algorithm for forecasting and analysis of time series stock returns. The current study examines daily, monthly, and yearly time series stock returns on Tehran Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange over a period from 2007 to 2013. The statistical analysis in London Stock Exchange shows that the L-Co-R algorithm outperforms to the other methods, regardless of the horizon, and is capable of predicting short, medium, or long horizons using real known values. The statistical analysis in Tehran Stock Exchange shows that the L-Co-R algorithm outperforms to the other methods and is capable of predicting only short and medium terms.

The method is based on a wavelet multiscale approach within the framework of a capital asset pricing model. Empirical results demonstrate that beta coefficients have a multiscale tendency, and betas tend to increase at higher scales (lower frequencies). In addition, the size of betas and R2s tends to increase during the crisis period compared with the precrisis period. The multiscale nature of the betas is consistent with the fact that stock market investors have different time horizons due to different trading strategies. Our results based on scale dependent value at risk (VaR) suggest that market risk tends to be more concentrated at lower time scales (higher frequencies) of the data. Moreover, the scale-by-scale estimates of VaR have increased almost three folds for every market during the crisis period compared with the precrisis period. Finally, our approach allows for accurately forecasting time-dependent betas and VaR. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",CAPM; global financial crisis; multiscale systematic risk; wavelet analysis; wavelet networks,Europe; equity; financial crisis; financial market; investment; stock market; wavelet analysis

"Minimising the inflationary impact of fiscal deficits in Africa: The role of monetary, financial and political institutions",2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076088016&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1813&partnerID=40&md5=99ab22ec3378d92fd9ec64ea1252c77a,"This is an examination of the relationship between fiscal deficits and inflation in Africa based on the premise that the characteristics of monetary, financial and political institutions, do impact the nature of this relationship. The study hypothesizes that, the inflationary effect of fiscal deficits is minimised when the central bank is independent (CBI) and the financial market is developed enough to contain inflationary expectations. This impact is much more effective given stronger political institutions. Using a panel data spanning 1970–2012 for 48 African countries, we use a Two Stage System Generalised Methods of Moments estimator, with Windmeijer (2005) corrected SE and collapsed instruments to address the issue of instrument proliferation. We also use various measures of central bank independence, financial development and political institutional quality. Fiscal deficits are inflationary in Africa. The positive effect of fiscal deficits on inflation is weakened when the degrees of Central Bank Independence (CBI) and financial development are higher. Financial development minimises the modulating impact of lower CBI on inflationary fiscal deficits. While stronger political institutions minimise the dampening effect of high central bank turnover on inflationary fiscal deficits, it enhances the positive impact of stronger central bank independence and financial development on minimising inflationary fiscal deficits. The results are robust to varying measures of CBI, financial development, and political institutions. Africa's financial sector should therefore be developed alongside strengthening the independence of central banks and ensuring that the quality of political institutions are enhanced in order to effectively curtail inflationary fiscal deficits. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Africa; central bank independence; financial development, political institutions; fiscal deficits; inflation",Africa; central bank; econometrics; financial system; fiscal policy; inflation; monetary policy; numerical model; political economy
Optimal investment and endogenous payout strategy with time inconsistency,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075726093&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1812&partnerID=40&md5=67335711ad00e55c20dd6ef36ae35d31,"This study extends the classical model to focus on a firm's optimal investment and endogenous payout strategies when a manager has time-inconsistent preferences, which we describe by a quasi-hyperbolic discount function. We attempt to reveal the impacts of time-inconsistency on liquidation, external financing, credit lines, and risk management. The extended model predicts that the time-inconsistent manager tends to (a) pay out cash to shareholders earlier by lowering the dividend payment, which causes the firm to hold less cash reserves and raise less equity; (b) invest less in the high cash and engage in much less costly asset sales in the low cash; and (c) choose not to hedge earlier than a time-consistent counterpart. In addition, our model also shows that the manager's time-inconsistent preferences decrease firm value and the marginal value of cash. These results highlight that corporate decisions, including payouts, cash holdings, investment, external financing, and even risk management strategies, are highly dependent on the manager's time-inconsistent preferences. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",endogenous payout strategy; external financing strategy; optimal investment; quasi-hyperbolic discount function; time-inconsistent preferences,capital flow; capital market; credit provision; financial system; investment; stakeholder; strategic approach
Determinants of stock market development and price volatility in ASEAN plus three countries: The role of institutional quality,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076005601&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1804&partnerID=40&md5=568d524aabef6833c3db6e6346906c95,"The present study investigates the determinants of stock market development and price volatility in a sample of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus three countries. More specifically, the study explores the role of institutional quality indicators on stock market development and volatility. To achieve the objectives of the study, we use annual data from 1991 to 2014 and employ panel cointegration test, fully modified ordinary least square method, and heterogeneous noncausality test. Our empirical findings confirm the significant long-run relationship among the variables. Similarly, our results of long-run elasticities on stock market development and volatility indicate that the institutional freedom indicators such as regulation, size of the government, sound money, and trade freedom have significant positive effect on stock market development, and these indicators, along with legal system, have substantial negative impact on stock price volatility. We also find significant short-run causalities of stock market development and price volatility with the macroeconomic variables. Given these results, our study suggests that the institutional freedom indicators not only promote stock market development, but they also effectively reduce stock price volatility in ASEAN plus three countries. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",ASEAN plus three countries; institutional freedom indicators; Macro fundamentals; panel econometric models; stock market development; stock price volatility,annual variation; financial market; financial system; institutional framework; price dynamics; stock market
New synchronicity indices between real and financial cycles: Is there any link to structural characteristics and recessions in European Union countries?,2020,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079070419&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1770&partnerID=40&md5=07c3de930a5e72fffc27ed5ab770bf29,"In this paper, we examine the comovements and relationships between real, credit, house, and equity price cycles in European Union countries looking at their link to structural characteristics and their predictive power for future recessions. We make use of new within country synchronicity indices, finding that among the different credit cycles and between the house price cycle and the real cycle, there is a relatively high level of synchronicity. Credit and gross domestic product (GDP) fluctuations seem to be less synchronised, mostly because credit volumes tend to lag the real cycle by several quarters. The high rates of private homeownership tend to be associated with larger cycles in GDP, credit, and house prices. Higher loan-to-value ratios, seen as a proxy of borrowing constraints, and a higher percentage of flexible-rate mortgages, could also indicate that a country is more sensitive to shocks and possibly increase procyclicality and increase cycle volatility. Finally, the procyclicality of the credit and housing market to the GDP cycle can be linked to the fluctuation in current accounts and their misalignments with respect to the theoretical equilibrium value. Some synchronicity measures and, above all, the credit cycles may also be considered for signalling future recessions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",credit cycles; house and equity price cycles; housing market; panel probit; real cycles; synchronicity,Europe; credit provision; economic instability; European Union; Gross Domestic Product; housing market; price dynamics
"Democracy, dictatorship, and economic freedom signals in stock market",2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074798286&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1794&partnerID=40&md5=6123bb142884bf74a1579f083d52092a,"The performance of 87 stock markets around the world is examined over the period December 1995 through June 2016. Market responses to democracy or dictatorship and several economic freedom measures are estimated. The democracy/dictatorship measures are based on the Cheibub, Gandhi, and Vreeland data system. Measures of economic freedom, property rights, and corruption are taken from the Heritage Foundation indices since inception. Data are used as first differences to capture any response to new information. Democracy/dictatorship has a significant impact on returns; that is, added risk commands a higher return. The stock markets react positively to the release of economic freedom index data. The adjusted change in economic freedom scoring and corruption has a positive impact on market returns, but no effect was found for property rights. These results are consistent with increases in “perceived risk” impacting returns. Lower corruption (a higher freedom from corruption score) should lead to better returns as cash off flow should diminish and either be paid out to the investor or reinvested in the firm. Key conclusions are as follows: Required investment compensation is lower in a democracy than a dictatorship, a reduction in corruption is associated with improving returns, the region of the world where the stock market index is located matters, and positive changes in economic freedom are associated with a positive market return change. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",democracy; dictatorship; economic freedom; international markets; risk premia; stock index returns,democracy; econometrics; economic conditions; international relations; international trade; political economy; stock market

Furthermore, we consider the Islamic risk premium as a market factor. Wavelet analysis results in Malaysia highlight the presence of the Islamic effect at low frequency bands and a higher intensity among the corporate debt market.

Are competitive microfinance services worth regulating?

Policy questions such as whether competitive microfinance institution (MFI) requires strong regulation to reduce, for example, credit risk or competition and regulation operate in the opposite direction, which each tends to dampen the effect of the other, are an empirical issue that this paper provides answers based on data on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) for the period 1995–2015, utilizing panel data approaches. Finding from the study indicates that low competition increases credit risk among MFIs in SSA, which regulation helps reduce such behaviour. The effect of regulation on credit risk is conditional on the level of competition, at the first percentile of competition (imply more competition); regulation does not reduce credit risk behaviour of MFIs but does at competition level above the 25th percentile (imply less competition). Regulation, on the other hand, does not affect operational risk at any level of competition. These findings have implications for policy formulation on the regulation and operations of MFIs in SSA. Our findings suggest that the MFI industry could be regulated efficiently if policymakers develop policies targeted at reducing credit risk exposures of MFIs than their exposure to operational risk. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Competition; financial services; microfinance; portfolio risk; regulation,Sub-Saharan Africa; competition (economics); financial crisis; financial services; microfinance; policy making; regulatory framework

First that smoothing the returns on individual assets by simple trend following techniques is a potent tool to enhance withdrawal rates.Second, we show that while diversification across asset classes does lead to higher withdrawal rates than simple equity/bond portfolios, “smoothing” returns in itself is far more powerful a tool for raising withdrawal rates. In fact,smoothing the popular equity/bond portfolios (such as the 60/40 portfolio) is in itself an excellent and simple solution to constructing a retirement portfolio. Alternatively, trend following enables portfolios to contain more risky assets, and the greater upside they offer, for the same level of overall risk compared to standard portfolios.

The board of directors consists of the CEO, the chairman, the internal directors, and the external non-executive directors to work for the shareholders. This study undertakes different corporate governance attributes including non-executive directors, board size, and CEO duality and examines its effect on firm performance. The dynamic panel model is used, and preestimation and postestimation tests were conducted for the validity of the model.

An agent-based model of a pure market economy is designed so that a population of firms interact with one another and with a bank. The model determines the interfirm payment network arising from supplier–customer relationships on the basis of a random graph with uniform attachment mechanisms. The interfirm payment network shapes both the liquidity available to each firm and the debts firms incur to finance these payments. Eventually, firms might not have sufficient liquidity to meet their debt requirements, hence their financial distress. Firms that target higher FCFs must reduce their payments to suppliers for the same amount of payments they expect to receive from customers. This influences the interfirm payment network and, therefore, firms' financial distress. On this basis, computational experiments introduce variations in FCF targets. The lowest FCF targets lead to the lowest levels of financial distress in the business sector. Our simplified case of interactions opens the way for further research that employs more complex agent-based models. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",agent-based computational economics; business sector; financial distress; free cash flow; interfirm payment network; random graph,business service; capital flow; capital market; debt; financial system; retailing

We find that market expectations of the time to lift-off from the zero lower bound are significantly affected in the expected direction by surprises in SEP dots and in forward guidance. We also find a significant impact of macroeconomic news on market participants' expectations of time to lift-off. These results are consistent with forward guidance about policy rates and SEP forecasts each contributing to the public's understanding of future Federal Reserve monetary policy and with the conditionality of both forms of communication about future policy rates being understood. We also present evidence that market expectations concerning the time to lift-off are influenced by the maximum time to lift-off implied by forward guidance, the SEP, and the economic outlook.

The result of our estimation suggests that the adjustment speed is faster than estimates reported in the literature. In addition, parallel with the long-run neutrality and short-run nonneutrality of monetary policy in large economies, we provide a pioneer discussion and empirical evidence of long-run neutrality and short-run nonneutrality of exchange rate policy in the small open economy. To our knowledge, we are the first group of researchers conducting rigorous study on this important issue for small open economies. Finally, we found evidence of the Harrold–Balassa–Samuelson (HBS) effect, and our results support Lothian and Taylor's argument that failure to include the effect in the estimation would lead to biased estimate in the adjustment speed. Thus, one should be cautious of the significant portion of past empirical studies that did not incorporate the HBS effect in their estimations. Future empirical studies should include the effect in the estimations and tests, or at least test for the absence of the effect before excluding it from the estimations. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",exchange rate policy; long-run neutrality; nonlinear adjustment and mean reversion speed; purchasing power parity; short-run nonneutrality; smooth transition autoregressive models,Singapore [Southeast Asia]; empirical analysis; exchange rate; financial policy; inflation; macroeconomics; monetary policy; purchasing power parity

This paper examines empirically the impact of real exchange rate uncertainty on private investment in Ghana. We, thus, apply the accelerator theory to investigate the contributing effect of real exchange rate uncertainty on the movement of private investment from the economic standpoint of an import-dependent economy such as Ghana. The study employs annual time series data from 1980 to 2016. Moreover, we adopt the autoregressive distributed lag model of cointegration where we find evidence of a long-run positive relationship between positive private investment and real exchange rate uncertainty as well as trade openness. The short-run evidence provides a confirmation of the impact of inflation, trade, and real exchange rate uncertainty on private investment. Specifically, our results show that there is a positive pass-through effect from real exchange rate uncertainty to private investment decision in resource allocation. Shocks from lending rate and terms of trade were found to exhibit negative effects on private investment in the short and long run. As a matter of policy, it is imperative for policymakers in developing economies to consider the effect of exchange rate and terms of trade associated with bilateral trade and investment-related agreements to minimize the effects of contemporaneous shocks from uncertainties. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",ARDL; developing economies; exchange rate uncertainty; Ghana; private investment,Ghana; developing world; economic impact; exchange rate; inflation; investment; policy making; regression analysis; trade; uncertainty analysis

We first construct the systemic risk factors by using the portfolio mimicking method. Then we analyse the systemic risk factors through the lens of the empirical asset pricing test to determine whether the factors are systematically priced in the equity market. As a result, we empirically find evidence that the systemic risk factors are systematically priced in the equity market, indicating that the systemic risk is compensated for the higher returns. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Empirical asset pricing model; equity market; factor model; systematic risk; systemic risk,United States; compensation system; empirical analysis; numerical model; price dynamics; risk factor; stock market

We find that AH-share firms have much higher sensitivity of executive compensation to firm performance than A-share firms. However, the bonding effect only exists when executive cash compensation and firm accounting performance are considered. Executive compensation on stock return, chief executive officer turnover on firm accounting performance, or chief executive officer turnover on stock market performance, all demonstrate no bonding effect. The results are attributed to institutional environment in which executive compensation is solely dependent on accounting profits among Chinese firms, and the A-share market offers weak investor protection. We also find that both legal and reputational bonding effects work on improved governance of AH-share firms, although such effects are highly dependent on specific market mechanisms including that of firm executives.

Finally, through a preliminary empirical study, our model is shown to be superior to the Heston-CIR model, which demonstrates the importance of introducing the regime-switching mechanics. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",empirical study; European options; generalized moment generating function; Heston-CIR hybrid model; regime switching; semianalytical solution,Europe; empirical analysis; financial market; interest rate; pricing policy; probability; stochasticity
The intertwining of credit and banking fragility,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076336372&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1799&partnerID=40&md5=7a33515329d8020a66cd464fd3876107,"Although the literature has provided evidence of the predictive power of credit for financial and banking crises, this article aims to investigate the grounds of this link by assessing the interrelationships between credit and banking fragility. The main identification assumption represents credit and banking fragility as a system of simultaneous joint data generating processes whose error terms are correlated. We test the null hypotheses that credit positively affects banking fragility—a vulnerability effect—and that banking fragility has a negative effect on credit—a trauma effect. We use seemingly unrelated regressions and 3SLS on a panel of European Union (EU) countries from 1998 to 2012 and control for the financial and macroeconomic environment. We find a positive effect of credit on banking fragility in the EU as a whole, in the Eurozone, in the core of the EU but not at its periphery, and a negative effect of banking fragility on credit in all samples. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",banking fragility; credit growth; nonperforming loans; SUR model,Europe; banking; credit provision; economic growth; financial crisis; financial market; financial services
Inflation-growth nexus in developing economies: New empirical evidence from a disaggregated approach,2021,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074990025&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1787&partnerID=40&md5=c93efcb90feca3ca5b98f8a3fe4831ce,"This paper examines the “inflation-growth nexus” by considering sectoral growth data of 113 developing economies. Research at the aggregate level yields mostly ambiguous results. Here, we perform a disaggregated analysis of inflation and output growth. For each sector—agriculture, industry, and services—inflation and value-added sectoral growth, for the period 1981–2015, are considered, and sectoral inflationary spillovers are captured. Empirical analysis reveals that three major sectors of the economy react differently to various impulses of inflation, and the significance of sectoral inflation is evidenced. Inflation is found to be detrimental to the growth of industrial sector only, and when sectoral inflation is accounted for, no significant impact of inflation is found in services and agricultural sectors. The policy relevance for developing economies is that the central banks of these economies must carefully consider the differing consequences of their actions on individual sectors while taking into consideration the value-added share of each sector in the respective economy. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",developing economies; disaggregated approach; inflation-growth nexus; inflationary spillovers; sectoral growth,central bank; developing world; economic development; economic growth; empirical analysis; financial policy; inflation; spillover effect
Does volume really matter?

We test whether the support for or against the hypothesis is unconditional and holds true universally irrespective of the time period under study, the stock market under study, and the distributional assumptions so made on the residuals of the returns. We find that the persistence in volatility shows negligible reduction in all the indices across subperiods, thus refuting the claims of the MDH: that volume can explain the heteroscedasticity of returns. However, we do find that volume can act as a proxy for information post the sub-prime financial crisis, and it does impact VaR as the estimates improve significantly for some of these indices, which exhibit a strong correlation between volume and volatility. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",mixture of distribution hypothesis; Pearson Type IV; value at risk; volatility persistence,correlation; financial crisis; hypothesis testing; risk assessment; stock market; vector autoregression

We are focused on financial crises that necessarily have the features of systemic banking crises and assess econometric early warning system of 64 systemic banking crises that occurred in the period from 1977 to 2013. The paper employs two different procedures, based on panel logit regression. The dynamic discrete-choice (binary) early warning model clearly outperformed the static model. The set of significant explanatory variables changed relative to the findings of the static model. The most significant predictor of the crises in the better performing model is deposit insurance system, followed by international reserves, M2-to-international reserves ratio, M2 multiplier, bank deposits, and bank reserves ratio. The statistical significance of the lagged variable confirmed the necessity to take the effect of crisis persistence into account. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",dynamic model; financial regulation; logit estimation; systemic banking crises,accountability; early warning system; financial crisis; financial system; logit analysis; numerical model; regression analysis

The results show that (a) the likelihood of zero leverage increases significantly following a downgrade in credit rating; (b) zero leverage is the outcome of the past attempts by firms to issue more overvalued equity capital; and (c) firms with overconfident CEOs are more likely to choose zero leverage. The results clearly suggest that the conditions prevailing in both credit and equity markets exert significant influence on zero-leverage policy. The analysis also advocates the inclusion of managerial biases in conjunction with the market-wide conditions in the analysis of zero-leverage policy. Overall, the findings reveal that zero-leverage firms find that the benefits of issuing overvalued equity outweigh the benefits associated with debt financing. These results are robust to a battery of checks. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",CEO overconfidence; credit rating; equity mispricing; Zero leverage,United States; credit provision; debt; policy making
Threshold effects in the relationship between financial development and income inequality,2020,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077859188&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1757&partnerID=40&md5=e86ce5cd2eb560c3892aa0f53231ce73,"This paper investigates the existence of nonlinearities in the relationship between financial development and income inequality, using the instrumental variable threshold regression introduced by Caner and Hansen in2004. It is shown, on the basis of cross-sectional data of 60 developed and developing countries, that there is a significant financial development threshold effect in the finance–inequality nexus. Particularly, our findings are consistent with the Greenwood and Jovanovic hypothesis of an inverted U-shaped relationship between banking sector development and inequality. However, there is no evidence for an inverted U-shaped relationship between stock market development and inequality. Besides, our estimates lead to inconclusive results regarding the impact of stock market development on income distribution in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Our results show that under the lower regime, the weight of the market is very light and its contribution to income distribution does not matter, whereas under the higher regime, market expansion leads to more inequity. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",financial development; income inequality; instrumental variable threshold regression; panel data,banking; finance; income distribution; nonlinearity; regression analysis; stock market; threshold
Liner and nonliner sectoral response of stock markets to oil price movements: The case of Saudi Arabia,2020,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075425639&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1755&partnerID=40&md5=3f3d8a7cf88fb372d5944af6d3c01d91,"With respect to Saudi Arabia for the period 2007–2016, this study employs linear (ordinary least square and causality tests) and nonlinear (Markov switching technique) to determine the long-run relationship between stock market returns, in aggregate, and oil prices, as independent variable on the one hand, with sectoral returns in stock markets, and as dependent variable on the other. Results suggest that sectors in the Saudi market generally respond asymmetrically to oil prices. Overall, in the long run, the Saudi market, in aggregate, was found to be cointegrated with sectoral returns being affected more by overall stock market returns than by oil returns. When nonlinear Markov switching technique was employed, results were only significant in certain sectors namely cement, petrochemical industries, building and construction, and energy and utilities where regime switching between high and low volatilities was detected around the global financial crisis in 2008. Based on these findings, the study recommends investors to consider investing in sectors that balance between those with returns that vary directly and inversely with oil prices in an effort to create “oil-neutral” portfolios rather than uniformly investing across all sectors in the Saudi market or consider investing in Saudi market sectors in the case of high oil prices. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Asymmetric cointegration; market returns; Markov switching; oil prices; sector returns,Saudi Arabia; crude oil; financial crisis; price dynamics; stock market
Identifying a robust policy rule for the Fed's response to financial stress,2020,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074752143&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1766&partnerID=40&md5=ec4ee07ceab59859a601d5eb7f055d89,"We seek to identify a policy rule for the Fed that remains valid in both periods of high and low financial stress. Using real-time data, we examine traditional linear Taylor rules, Taylor rules augmented with a financial stress measure, and nonlinear Taylor rules for the Fed's response in the pre-crisis period that lasts from 1982 to 2007. We determine that financial conditions were a significant source of nonlinearity in the Fed's response during this period, with greater volatility in the financial sector causing the Fed to prioritize the stabilisation of financial markets over its traditional policy objectives. We then extend the analysis to include the financial crisis of 2008 and find that our nonlinear Taylor rule framework also provides a plausible explanation for the Fed's conduct of monetary policy over this period. Our results, thus, show that the Fed's reaction to the recent financial crisis was not that dissimilar from its response to previous episodes of financial stress. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Federal reserve; financial crisis; nonlinearity; real-time data; Taylor rule,financial crisis; financial market; financial policy; monetary policy; nonlinearity
Risk contagion in the cross-border banking network: Some new evidence,2020,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075741115&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1763&partnerID=40&md5=06225fcacf7ddb1f73f0553c36f9aaf9,"This paper applies consolidated banking statistics data from the Bank for International Settlement to simulate risk contagion in a cross-border banking system with shocks of credit and liquidity. Simulation results from balance sheet network analysis show that the banking systems of the United States and United Kingdom are the most systemically important systems under the credit shocks in June 2008. Moreover, banking system's counter-shocks ability is directly related to its size and concentration of foreign claims. The banking systems of German and French are the most systemically important systems under the liquidity shocks. Some banking systems depend heavily on German and French banking systems for financing and are vulnerable to liquidity shocks. Risk transfer has influence on risk contagion in the cross-border banking system. After the subprime crisis, cross-border risk contagion has declined because of deleveraging foreign claims. Raising the capital level of the banking system or intervention in the interbank market to enhance the liquidity of the market under pressure scenarios can reduce the contagion effect of credit or liquidity shocks. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",banking system; Contagion; credit shock; cross-border banking network; liquidity shock,France; Germany; United Kingdom; United States; banking; capital; credit provision; financial market; financial services; financial system; network analysis

Capital structure adjustment and market reaction following seasoned equity offerings,2020,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074827600&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1758&partnerID=40&md5=18e61588c49adbf8bd7104648fe553ae,"This paper analyzes the market reaction towards capital structure adjustment through seasoned equity offerings in the United States. It recognizes that capital structure and equity mispricing are closely associated with seasoned equity offering. We specifically propose that if the trade-off theory holds and firms follow target capital structures, then, firms that are overlevered would effectively exploit an overvalued equity in a cost-effective adjustment of their capital structures through seasoned equity offerings. We also test how the market then reacts to such capital structure adjustment attempts. Controlling for other motives of seasoned equity offerings in a sample of 1,725 secondary issues by 1,016 U.S. nonfinancial firms from 2004 to 2013, we found that firms that were ex ante overlevered and overvalued were more likely to announce a seasoned equity offering. As regards the market reaction to such capital structure adjustments, it is found that the market favorably reacted in both the short term and long term, as evidenced by positive 3-day cumulative abnormal returns and buy-and-hold abnormal returns, respectively. Moreover, post-event evidence suggests that on the average, overlevered firms reduced their deviations from the target and that their leverage levels mainly stayed around the targets until at least 3 years after the secondary equity issues. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",equity mispricing; market timing; optimal capital structure; residual income valuation model; seasoned equity offering,United States; capital formation; capital market; equity; price dynamics; structural adjustment; trade-off

The estimation is performed by adding the regional currency premium to a global four-factor model that includes momentum and the Fama and French factors (market, size, and book-to-market factors). Tests of the model's ability to explain both the time series and the cross section of stock returns show that currency risk premium improves the fitness of global factors in explaining domestic returns, although models with domestic factors still outperform the model with global factors and currency risk. The results indicate that the regional currency premium factor captures dimensions of risks not captured by the Fama and French and momentum factors. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Asset pricing; currency risk; factor model; finance; foreign exchange; regional risk,capital market; currency market; estimation method; exchange rate; investment; model test; risk assessment; stock market

The point estimates of the range of econometric specifications suggest that a 10-percentage point increase in the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is associated with 23 basis point reduction in average growth. The results establish the nonlinear relationship between debt and growth. Further, by employing panel vector autoregressions approach, this study decomposes the cause and effect relationship between debt and growth and offers an answer to the question—Does high debt lead to low growth or low growth leads to high debt? The results derived from the impulse–response functions and variance decomposition show the evidence of the long-term effect of debt on economic growth. The results indicate that the effect is not uniform for all countries but depends mostly on the debt regimes and other important macroeconomic variables like inflation, trade openness, general government final consumption expenditure, and foreign direct investment. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Country groupings; economic growth; government debt; nonlinearity; panel data,debt; econometrics; economic growth; foreign direct investment; vector autoregression

The model adjusts to the long-run equilibrium with an annual speed of 11% from any situation of disequilibrium and with elasticities of −3.97 and −0.67, respectively, for a land and Global Economic Policy Uncertainty (gepu). Meanwhile, the impact during a short run of gepu is statistically significant and positive on hp, whereas it is not significant for land. Interestingly, the investigation reveals Granger causality from agricultural land to the housing price with feedback. The research presents an indication that policymaker(s) and urbanization stakeholders should be more concern about effective and sustainable long-term policies.

We also compute China's currency gains and losses in CFET countries using the approach in and analysed how reducing national savings will impact on currency gains in the FX market. Analysing the fluctuations in capital flows, and its determinants, are significant for the restructuring since the government has undertaken to reduce his participation in direct financing. The research found that the gradual tightening of monetary policy if core inflation continues to pick up will not affect the long run current account growth, whereas reduced savings will have a short-run adverse effect on growth. These conclusions support the assertion in. Furthermore, the liberalization of the financial systems reduces growth in the short run, whereas the fluctuations in renminbi have no impact on the capital account. We, therefore, do not find evidence of currency stability, aiding and facilitating net capital flows. Also, the decision to tighten policy rates and the effects on the capital account depends on the margin of the change. Lastly, the liberalization reforms will increase currency gains and also trigger currency appreciations. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",balance of payments; CFETS; financial reforms; monetary policy; vector error correction method,China; balance of payments; business; capital flow; currency; error correction; liberalization; monetary policy; savings
Domestic financial reforms and crisis recoveries,2020,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075738405&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1749&partnerID=40&md5=aee7d440db755a4d5de0c81fe8da960e,"We examine empirically whether domestic financial reforms lead to faster recoveries from financial crises. Using a duration analysis approach and financial reform indicators from Abiad, Detragiache, and Tressel (2010), we find robust evidence that a higher overall level of domestic financial liberalization is associated with a significantly shorter duration of recovery. This effect exists in both the downturn and upturn stages of a crisis but matters only for developing countries. We also check the effect of each individual dimension of domestic financial reforms and find they all contribute to significant faster crisis recoveries except for privatization of the banking sector. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",domestic financial reforms; duration analysis; financial crises; recoveries,banking; economic reform; financial crisis; financial policy; liberalization; monetary policy

It further examines whether the effect of the institutional environment and banking regulation varies for crisis and noncrisis years. The estimation results reveal that banks' dividend policy influences positively banks' profitability, whereas higher levels of the institutional environment or stricter banking regulation reduces banks' profitability. The negative effect of the institutional environment and banking regulation was of lower magnitude during the global financial crisis, followed by the Eurozone crisis, and for less-developed countries and larger banks. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bank profitability; bank regulation; dividend policy; financial crisis; institutions,banking; financial crisis; financial policy; institutional framework; profitability; regulatory approach

As predicted by Duffie's (1996) model, our results show that collateral supply is a significant factor for specialness. However, we enrich that finding by also showing a clear impact from repo liquidity, collateral riskiness, information uncertainty, and short-selling proxies, revealing the importance of speculative bond demand for specialness. During crisis periods, bond fire sales and European Central Bank interventions also have a large impact on repo specialness. We identify recurrent patterns for specialness around bond auctions. Specialness increases steadily from the auction announcement date until a few days before the auction settlement date, which is consistent with overbidding behaviour and a short selling of treasuries (via reverse repos) from primary dealers ahead of auctions. © 2019 The Authors.

Consistent with the dilemma proposition, domestic interest rates are determined by global financial conditions and the FED rate even under floating exchange rate regimes (ERR) in the long-run. The impact of the FED rates is higher in EME than AE and EME are much more sensitive to global financial cycle under managed than floating ERR. The spillover from the FED rate substantially increases after the GFC in EME with floating ERR and AE. The results from the monetary policy reaction functions based on equilibrium correction mechanism specifications suggest that domestic interest rates respond to inflation and output gaps especially under inflation targeting (IT) in the short-run. The response to inflation gap tends to be smaller in IT AE after the GFC. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Exchange rate regimes; global financial crisis; inflation targeting; monetary policy; policy trilemma,economic instability; exchange rate; financial crisis; inflation; interest rate; monetary policy; spillover effect

We find that the stock market volatility, measured by the “pushing factor” VIXS&P500, provides agents with the most reliable and efficient information in terms of predicting market returns during bear market conditions, whereas “pulling factors” such as money supply, treasury yields, and unemployment explain the main stylized facts, incorporating contagion and diverse endogenous and exogenous shocks.

Central bank independence and inflation—Old story told anew,2020,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066854423&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1730&partnerID=40&md5=7cf0fbfecff09c2975e233649f561bf7,"Central bank independence (CBI) and its link to inflation have become a part of conventional wisdom. However, the literature shows that there is a lack of a stable general pattern for the relation between CBI and inflation, even for relatively homogenous groups of countries. In this study, we use two indexes for CBI proposed in the literature. For the panel of 51 countries (24 advanced and 27 nonadvanced economies), we estimate two regression models—one with inflation as a dependent variable and another with inflation gap in this role. We use two estimation methods: the panel fixed effects model with serial autocorrelation in the error term and the Arellano-Bond difference generalized method of moments estimator. In addition, we use disaggregated indices to check what aspects of independence are of highest importance. Our results suggest that CBI has a negative significant impact on inflation mostly by results for nonadvanced economies and that this relationship did not change during the recent crisis. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Advanced and nonadvanced economies; central bank independence; dynamic panel data models; global financial crisis; inflation; inflation gap,autocorrelation; central bank; financial crisis; inflation; panel data

We find that higher customer concentration is associated with higher bond spreads, shorter bond maturity, and more bond covenants. In contrast, better institutions are associated with lower bond spreads, longer bond maturity, and fewer bond covenants. Moreover, we find that the adverse or unfavourable association between customer concentration and bond contract terms is weakened for firms operating within better institutions or for firms whose ultimate owners are the Central Government of China. Furthermore, the adverse association between customer concentration and bond contract terms is more pronounced when a supplier's major customers have lower switching costs or when the supplier has made more relationship-specific investments. Finally, our main results are robust to controls for endogeneity concerns and other sensitivity checks. Overall, our findings suggest that bondholders view customer concentration as a risk factor but better institutions as a protection. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",contract terms; corporate bonds; customer concentration; emerging markets; empirical evidence; institution,

However, at the aggregate level, in neither bubble period do we uncover a stable relation between average stock returns and analysts' advice.

To identify structural breaks and their persistence, an autoregressive two-state regime switching model is presented. The variability in the LIBOR–OIS spread along with thresholds, which delimit four intensities, reveals regime changes consistent with liquidity crashes. The transition between the states is state dependent, and the posterior estimates for the crisis and noncrisis states are estimated using the Gibbs sampler. We forecast our early warning indicator up to December 2011 and show that the estimates are superior to a random walk with drift. Therefore, the model is an effective early warning indicator of an imminent liquidity shortage impacting the interbank market. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Bayesian inference; early warning indicator; interbank market; liquidity crises; regime switching,banking; Bayesian analysis; financial crisis; market conditions; numerical model; structural change

Econophysicists recently developed an alarm index for institutional bank runs (IBRs) based on the log-periodic power law. The key innovation of this alarm index is that it shall measure the speculative interactions among professional creditors that can culminate in IBRs. The paper at hand extends this line of research, in particular, by applying new critical parameter ranges that were recently derived directly from credit default swap (CDS) spreads of defaulted banks. The better performance of the revised alarm index in comparison with the originally proposed alarm index underpins the hypothesis that the CDS market belongs to a different universality class than, for example, the stock market. Furthermore, the refined index outperforms a modification of the bank run probability index that was previously proposed in the financial literature. This result further confirms the hypothesis that—under certain circumstances—financial markets are driven by investors whose investment decisions critically depend on the actions of other investors. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bank run; CORA3 algorithm; credit default swap; econophysics; financial crisis; log-periodic power law,algorithm; banking; credit provision; financial crisis; financial market; financial system; institutional development; investment; power law

First, we use the Fama and French three-factor model to delve into the relationship between the risk-adjusted returns of high-yield bonds and equity market risk factors. Second, we gauge the extent to which the risk-adjusted returns of high-yield bonds are significantly higher than equity and investment-grade bonds' risk-adjusted returns. Third, by using a modified version of the Black–Litterman model, we explore the asset allocation to high-yield bonds, accounting for investors' risk tolerance. Our findings suggest that equity market risk factors have significant explanatory power for high-yield bonds' risk-adjusted returns, whereas the hypothesis of superior returns on high-yield bonds over investment-grade corporate bonds and equities cannot be supported. Our key contribution relates to the strategic asset allocation to high-yield bonds. Our results suggest that the share of high-yield bonds does not exceed 4.1% of total assets in a global market portfolio over the period 2007–2013. Notably, the share of high-yield bonds in a simulated portfolio remains relatively small and stable on a risk-adjusted basis, irrespective of an investor's risk profile or the phase of the business cycle. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",asset allocation; Black–Litterman model; Fama–French three-factor model; global financial crisis; high-yield bonds,United States; equity; financial crisis; global economy; market conditions; numerical model; risk factor

Four financial sustainability outcomes were considered: yield on gross portfolio; return on assets; portfolio at risk, 30 days; and operational self-sufficiency (OSS). Although for-profit MFIs had a higher Yield, there was no significant effect of profit orientation on ROA, PAR30, and OSS. Further analysis shows that although profit orientation has a significant effect on the yield of small MFIs, it does not have any effect on larger MFIs, which is consistent with the theory that larger MFIs can distribute its fixed costs better, requiring lower interest rates and allowing smaller yield on the gross portfolio. In addition, we show that the intrinsic characteristics of the MFIs account for the majority of the variance from the four outcomes. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",financial efficiency; microfinance; mission drift; multilevel model; profitability,financial market; financial system; institutional framework; interest rate; microfinance; profitability

Unlike major studies that explored this area of study in the GCC countries, this paper investigates the performance of both types of banks before, during, and after the 2008 financial crisis, while covering four different financial performance measures, namely, efficiency, profitability, liquidity, and solvency. Moreover, this investigation is undertaken while covering a larger time span (2006–2012) than perhaps all similar works that covered similar study on the GCC region. With the use of mixed-effect linear regression, the paper shows that, compared with Islamic banks, conventional banks have sustained a better performance over the 2006–2012 period in relation to efficiency and return on assets. In this context, the paper puts a note on the shortcomings of the institutional arrangement of the Islamic banks that impeded their performance during the crisis as well as on the active role of GCC governments during the financial crash. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",conventional banks; financial crisis; financial performance indicator; Islamic banks,banking; financial crisis; government; Islamism

In addition, innovation in products and the process of management make it competitive, and they considerably contribute to the growth of the company's performance. Therefore, the present research aims to study the relationship between the social and economic responsibilities with the financial performance through relying on the facilitating role of innovation. To accomplish this, 278 data samples were collected from the staff working for an oil engineering and development company (in the period of December 2017 to March 2018) based on a Likert scale questionnaire. Then the results were analysed using structural equation models together with Amos24 and SPSS22 software. The results of this study showed that the impact of economic responsibility on innovation is only positive and significant and the social responsibility cannot affect innovation changes. Also, innovation is ineffective in the financial performance of the oil engineering and development company. Hence, it is essential to use effective polices related to the companies' economic responsibility necessary for obtaining better long-term innovations. Moreover, it is suggested that the managers provide insights for improving the role of social responsibility in achieving future benefits and higher financial performances. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Economic responsibility; financial performance; innovation; social innovation; social responsibility,economic impact; financial system; innovation; numerical model; oil industry; performance assessment; policy approach; social impact
Does one model fit all in global equity markets?

Though the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) provides an excellent risk–return framework and the market beta may reflect the risk associated with risky assets, there are opportunities for investors to take advantage of dimensional and time-varying return anomalies in order to improve their investment returns. In this paper, we restrict our analysis to return variations linked to market factor anomalies or factor or dimensional beta using the Fama–French three-factor; Carhart four-factor; Fama-French five-factor; and Asness, Frazzini, and Pederson (AFP)'s five- and six-factor models. We find significant variations in explaining sources of risk across 22 developed and 21 emerging markets with data over a long period from 1991 to 2016. Each market is unique in terms of factor risk characteristics, and market risk as explained by the CAPM is not the true risk measure. Hence, contrary to the risk–return efficiency framework, we find that lower market risk results in higher excess return in 19 out of the 22 developed markets, which is a major anomaly.

Proponents claim it provides a propitious time out when price levels are stressed and persuades traders to make rational trading decisions. Opponents demur its potency, dubbing it a barrier to laissez-faire price discovery process. Since conceptualization in 1970s and practice from 1980s, researchers focused mostly on its ability to allay panic, interference in trading, volatility transmission, prospect of self-fulfilling prophecy through gravitational pull towards itself, and delayed dissemination of information. Though financial economists are forked on circuit breakers' usefulness, they are a clear favourite among regulators, who downplay the reliability of anti-circuit breaker findings citing, inter alia, suspect methodology, and lack of statistical power. In the backdrop of 2007–2008 Crisis and 2010 Flash Crash, the drumbeats for more regulatory intervention in markets grew louder. Hence, it is unlikely that intervening mechanism such as circuit breakers will ebb. But are circuit breakers worth it?

Combining the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with a Cox proportional hazard, we uncover value in several financial factors as well as market-driven and macroeconomic variables in predicting a bank's decision to go public. Importantly, we document a significant improvement in the model's predictive ability compared with standard frameworks used in the literature.

The database is a macro panel of the 19 Eurozone countries over the period between January 2008 and May 2016. Using an events study approach, we create two dummy variables that reflect the timing and changes of unconventional and conventional monetary policy measures, which we use as key determinants in panel regression models. Our results suggest that unconventional monetary policies have a positive lagged impact on bank credit, with much more to general governments (1.2% per month) than to household consumers (0.2%). All other variables in the models, such as the interest rates, the Industrial Production Index, and the inflation rate have the expected estimated signs. Finally, we estimate the unobserved country-specific fixed effects measured in terms of credit growth rates. The monthly growth rates of loans to households in Ireland are about 0.74% below the average country, which is closely related to its post-2008 banking crisis.

Banking efficiency in emerging economies: Does foreign banks entry matter in the Ghanaian context?,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055593128&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1707&partnerID=40&md5=a4288e07dde65d438a75f81485b56b89,"This study empirically examines the effect of foreign banks entry on banking efficiency scores, using the truncated regression data envelopment analysis model for 25s banks in Ghana, over a 6-year period (2010–2015). We decompose the efficiency scores into three (technical, cost, and allocative efficiency), and the results indicate that banks in Ghana are marginally inefficient in operating closer to their optimal capacity. The findings show that the input-oriented model slacks are needed to push an inefficient bank closer to where an efficient bank is positioned. From the results, an immediate and a short-term entry of foreign banks have a consistent negative relationship with both technical- and cost-efficiency scores whereas long-term entry of foreign banks shows an inconsistent relationship with the three banking efficiency scores. Thus, the drive towards a positive impact of foreign banks entry on the three efficiency scores is dependent on the form of banking efficiency considered and the interaction term between competitive banking environment (competition) and foreign banks' entry. The study suggests that policymakers and managers in emerging markets should improve on their bank efficiencies in both a competitive banking environment and during periods of foreign bank entry. Moreover, managers of banks should make adjustment to their input resources in order to cope with new banking technologies from foreign bank entry—thereby improving banking efficiencies. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",banking efficiency scores; DEA slacks; foreign bank entry,Ghana; banking; data envelopment analysis; financial market; regression analysis

Despite the reduction of many previous barriers to foreign investment, investors are found to persistently overweight domestic equities. This paper examines whether the benefits of international diversification are available via U.S.-traded equity products over a 15-year period between 1996 and 2011. The equity products investigated are multinational corporations (MNCs), American depository receipts (ADRs), single-country exchange-traded funds, iShares, and closed-end country funds. Mean-variance spanning tests and Sharpe ratio analysis reveal that portfolios of ADRs and MNCs offer the greatest international diversification benefits to U.S. investors in a domestic setting. Whereas the benefits of international diversification vary during periods of differing market conditions, the findings for ADRs and MNCs remain robust. We conclude that it is possible to reap the benefits of international diversification via U.S.-traded equity products but that the benefits of different equity types vary significantly. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",American depository receipts; exchange-traded funds; international diversification; mean-variance spanning; US multinational corporations,United States; equity; international relations; international trade; investment; multinational enterprise

To do this, we use the rolling and recursive rolling Granger causality approaches. The distinguishing feature of this study from the previous studies is that this is the first study investigating the causal links between oil and gold using time-varying causality tests. The findings show that the causality links between oil and gold display strong time variation. Although causal links are not detected for most of the study period, strong bidirectional or unidirectional causality is found in several subsamples. The duration of the periods with causality links varies from a few months to 3 years, whereas the duration for the noncausality periods might be 15 years long. By date stamping the causality links between oil and gold, our paper discovers that causality from oil to gold is related to large oil price changes, whereas causality from gold to oil is related to large financial crises. The evidence obtained in the paper points out the dangers of assuming a constant causality link between oil and gold markets because these links might break down unexpectedly. Our findings point out to the dangers of assuming noncausality between oil and gold particularly in hedging oil price risk using gold. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",gold and oil prices; recursive rolling estimation; rolling estimation; time-varying Granger causality,estimation method; financial crisis; gas supply; Granger causality test; oil supply; price dynamics

Firstly, we forecast each factor with a pool of linear and nonlinear models. Next, the individual forecasts are combined through dynamic model averaging, and their performance is benchmarked by the best performing individual predictor and other forecast combination techniques. Finally, we use the generalized autoregressive score model and the skewed t copula method to estimate the correlation of assets. The generalized autoregressive score performance is also compared with other traditional approaches such as dynamic conditional correlation model and asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation. The performance of the constructed portfolios is assessed through traditional metrics and ratios accounting for the conditional value-at-risk and the conditional diversification benefits approach. Our results show that combining Bayesian forecast combinations with copulas is leading to significant improvements in the portfolio optimization process, and forecasting covariance accounting for asymmetric dependence between the factors adds diversification benefits to the obtained portfolios. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",dynamic model averaging; factor investing; forecast combinations; portfolio optimization,Bayesian analysis; econometrics; forecasting method; optimization; prediction

Numerous credit scoring techniques act as classification methods. In this paper, the main issue is simultaneous and hybrid utilization of the feature selection (FS) algorithm and ensemble learning classification algorithms with respect to their parameter settings to achieve higher performance in the proposed credit scoring model. As a result, this paper reports a hybrid data mining model of generalized fuzzy soft sets (GFSS) theory-based ensemble learning classification algorithms based on three stages. The first stage addresses data gathering and preprocessing. The second stage uses the adaptive elastic net-based FS algorithm to eliminate irrelevant or weakly correlated variables. After the appropriate variables are chosen, they are applied to the proposed ensemble model. In the third stage, GFSS theory is exploited to construct a novel weight assignment mechanism for each individual credit scoring model in the ensemble model according to performance. Several comparisons are conducted to validate the proposed model using real world credit datasets. The experimental results, analysis, and statistical tests prove the ability of the proposed approach to improve classification performance against all of the base classifier, hybrid, and combination methods in terms of average accuracy, area under the curve, H-measure, and Brier score. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",adaptive elastic net; credit scoring; ensemble learning; feature selection; GFSS,banking; credit provision; econometrics; ensemble forecasting; financial services; fuzzy mathematics

The findings are three-fold. First, board diversity, as measured by director gender and nationality, has a positive effect on corporate financial performance. Second, the relationship between board diversity and corporate performance is stronger in better governed firms than their poorly governed counterparts. Finally, board diversity, as measured by director gender, ethnicity, and nationality, enhances the pay-for-performance sensitivity but not the actual executive pay. Our results suggest that decisions about board diversity are not merely influenced by moral values; they arise because of the cost–benefit considerations of what diversity can bring to the firm.

For computational purpose, we apply two innovative methodologies—wavelet coherence and phase difference that are capable of observing different frequency scales. Wavelet coherence results suggest that strong coherence is present during world financial crisis (WFC) in the oil-exporting countries and in majority of the oil-importing countries. Phase arrows as well as phase difference suggest negative coherence between oil and exchange rates in the oil-importing countries during WFC. Negative coherence is found in these countries because currency depreciation was accompanied by immense oil price drop in WFC period. In addition, phase difference has relatively stable in-phase dynamics in long term in the oil-importing countries during tranquil periods, which confirms theoretical stance that higher oil prices cause currency depreciation and vice versa. As for the oil-exporting countries, we find constant and relatively long-lasting anti-phase pattern in Russian and Nigerian cases for long-term horizons but not for Brazilian one. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Emerging markets; exchange rate; oil; phase difference; wavelet coherence,Africa; Asia; Eastern Europe; South America; currency devaluation; developing world; exchange rate; financial crisis; global economy; oil trade; timescale

The empirical results indicate that (a) in general, international crude oil price shocks have positive effect on China's economic growth and inflation in the short run, but the long-run effect appears diverse; (b) China's monetary policy shocks have positive effect on the economic growth and inflation overall; specifically, an increase in monetary supply can partly offset crude oil prices' negative effect on China's economic growth; (c) China's monetary policy has positive effect on crude oil prices and plays an important role in the relationship between crude oil price shocks and economy; and (d) during the recent global financial crisis, crude oil price shocks produce greater negative effect on China's economic growth, whereas the long-run effect of monetary policy on China's economic growth proves weaker, compared with other periods. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",China's economy; crude oil price shocks; monetary policy; time-varying effect; TVP-VAR model,China; crude oil; economic growth; inflation; monetary policy; national economy; numerical model; price dynamics; vector autoregression
Economic precariousness: A new channel in the housing market cycle,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061792233&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1716&partnerID=40&md5=bd79244c1c182bec74cbda3147ca9cca,"Demographic and institutional elements, as important drivers of the housing market, should not be neglected because it is not only financial and monetary elements that matter in the case of the housing market. In this context, one relationship, which still remains unclear, is the relationship between the housing and the labour markets. Some research has been undertaken to support the hypothesis that high rates of homeownership lead to high unemployment via increases in the reservation wage. However, further research is needed to address the possible implications of the institutional settings of the labour market in the dynamics of the housing market. The aim of this paper is to bring some light on the link between both markets. In particular, this contribution explains how the housing cycle could be “amplified” via a new channel, that is, economic precariousness, which is closely related to job insecurity. Subsequently, we provide evidence in the case of five developed economies, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, over the period 1985–2013. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",cointegration techniques; economic precariousness; house prices; job insecurity; labour markets,Ireland; Netherlands; Spain; United Kingdom; United States; cointegration analysis; economic analysis; homeownership; housing market; hypothesis testing; income distribution; labor market; unemployment; wage
Does aggregate insider trading predict stock returns in China?,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054911561&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1699&partnerID=40&md5=0faefc5125ba6e7952dff398de21ca0a,"This paper studies the information content of aggregate insiders' transactions in their own firms in China by analysing approximately 28,000 open market transactions from July 2007 to December 2014. The evidence suggests that publicly available information about aggregate insiders' transactions cannot predict future stock returns. However, the ability of aggregate insiders' transactions to predict future stock returns is positively associated with the strength of corporate governance.

Pairs trading across Mainland China and Hong Kong stock markets,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055275738&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1687&partnerID=40&md5=309b2f448178a80aae6d7b4e70283de1,"Motivated by the rationale that market inefficiency arises from a combination of less than fully rational demand and limits to arbitrage, this paper investigates the profitability of pairs trading across Mainland China and Hong Kong on highly liquid large-cap and midcap stocks from January 1996 to July 2017. We have three main findings. First, we find that pairs trading constrained within each market generates no significant abnormal returns. However, if investors can trade across Mainland China and Hong Kong, pairs trading is profitable after adjusting for risk and transaction costs, where the annualized abnormal return is 9% over the full sample. Second, by using a rolling-window regression, we find that the profitability of the strategy is time-varying. The bootstrap simulations suggest that the decline in profitability of the strategy since 2012 is due to random chance rather than poor ability of identifying mispriced stocks. However, the vast majority of profitable periods reflect the strategy's ability to choose profitable stocks rather than random chance. Third, the profitability of the strategy is somewhat sensitive to market conditions, most notably, the strategy is more profitable during longer term market turbulence. Overall, our empirical findings are consistent with the Adaptive Market Hypothesis in that the integration of financial markets and market conditions determine the level of market efficiency. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Adaptive Market Hypothesis; bootstrap simulation; cross-border trading; market conditions; market efficiency; pairs trading,China; Hong Kong; bootstrapping; cross-border relations; hypothesis testing; market conditions; profitability; stock market; trade
Do demographics affect monetary policy transmission in Canada?,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055251300&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1691&partnerID=40&md5=d2e266898fe2cb9de175dceea3eaa7c4,"Using a panel of macroeconomic data for Canada and its 10 provinces, we estimate the dynamic effects of monetary policy shocks from the mid-1980s until the present. We then relate the change in the impact of these shocks to macroeconomic factors including demographics, specifically changes in the old age dependency ratio. We find that the inflation-targeting regime has had an ambiguous effect on the impact of monetary policy shocks in Canada. On the other hand, changing demographics have unambiguously reduced the impact of monetary policy shocks. This can help to explain tepid inflation since the financial crisis and could eventually undermine the effectiveness of Canada's inflation targeting regime. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Canada; credit channel; demographic change; inflation targeting; monetary policy,Canada; credit provision; demography; estimation method; financial crisis; inflation; macroeconomics; monetary policy

Our model considers both finite and uncertain tax holiday period settings. We show that the tax holiday duration may have, for small tax rate reductions, a nonmonotonic effect on the investment timing. For sufficiently high tax reductions, a longer tax holiday speeds up investment. A higher tax reduction during the tax holiday and a lower uncertainty are shown to have a monotonic effect on the threshold, hastening investment. However, in case of a finite tax holiday, for exceptional high salvage values, a higher uncertainty can speed up investment. We show the usefulness of our model to design an optimal incentives package that prompts investment. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",FDI; real options; tax holidays; taxation policy; uncertainty,foreign direct investment; incentive; investment; model; tax system; uncertainty analysis

Consistent with previous research, we find that listed firms in China have significantly more short-term debt than long-term debt. We also find that as the percentage ownership of the largest shareholder increases, less debt (as a percentage of total assets) is generally preferred. During economic slowdowns, firms tend to reduce their short-term debt levels, although long-term debt appears to increase. Further tests reveal that entrepreneur-controlled firms reduce long-term debt during economic slowdowns, suggesting that they take into consideration the implications of changes in macroeconomic conditions for earnings and liquidity when making debt financing decisions. However, we also find that State-controlled firms in China tend to increase short-term borrowing during declines in macroeconomic conditions, consistent with the implications of “tunneling and propping.”. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",capital structure; economic fluctuation; State control,China; capital market; debt; economic conditions; economic instability; macroeconomics; ownership; state role
How do investors price stocks?—Evidence with real-time data from Vietnam,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054887181&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1693&partnerID=40&md5=4a6ebb54befe9ad3ade3451db9f1d7ea,"Our paper employs a data set that comprises real-time data, which, in our study, is defined as the best known data available to investors at the time of making decision. The research was inspired by comments by industry leaders at an international conference in finance in Vietnam in 2016, basically implying that academic research findings were not useful to investors because they had not done in the way that investors think and do. Drawing on an alike experiment study using real-time data for a period from October 2010 to April 2014, our paper documents that the value and liquidity effect do not exist in Vietnam, and the size effect is weak. Specifically, we find that growth and high-liquidity stocks outperform and do not find strong evidence for the outperformance of small stocks. This finding contradicts the general literature, which suggests that value, low liquidity, and small stocks outperform but supports similar contradicting findings for emerging markets. The findings from our research are important to investors in Vietnam market because they are drawn on the decision-making basis that investors in this market normally do. Our research findings also suggest the use of a multifactor pricing model that is relevant for valuing stocks in Vietnam. In addition, to check the reliability of our data set and the robustness of our conclusions, we repeated the same procedure using two samples of historical data and compared with results from our data. The additional analysis confirms the reliability of our data and findings. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Asset pricing; pricing model; risk factors; stock returns; stock valuation; Vietnam,Viet Nam; data set; decision making; model; real time; reliability analysis; risk factor; stock assessment; stock market

The empirical results reveal that linear framework unable to detect the effects global economic policy uncertainty, and the Markov-switching model exhibits significant effects of global economic policy uncertainty on all sectoral stock returns excluding technology sector in Malaysia stock market. The findings also expose that the effects of global economic policy uncertainty vary across regime states, sectors, and nature of effects, where the negative effects of global economic policy uncertainty dominate over positive effects. The global economic policy uncertainty exhibits greater impacts on stock returns in high-volatility regime. Thus, the findings confirm the existence of asymmetric, nonlinear, nonmonotonic, and state-dependent relationship between global economic policy uncertainty and sectoral stock returns in Malaysia. Therefore, the overall empirical findings can be applied in asset pricing and investment decision-making purposes. The findings also suggest that global economic policy uncertainty can be a systemic risk factor and predictor of stock market returns. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",emerging stock market; global economic policy uncertainty; Malaysia; Markov-switching process; sectoral stock returns,Malaysia; economic impact; economic policy; global economy; Markov chain; stock market

Economic benefits of technical analysis in portfolio management: Evidence from global stock markets,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055060488&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1697&partnerID=40&md5=ba1784952e1c1b53ce730d3fad14befc,"Producing good economic value in trading strategies for investors based on technical analysis is an issue of major interest in the academe and in practice. This study considers 9,555 trading rules and examines the usability of technical analysis. The double-or-out (DO) and the optimal-portfolio (OP) strategies are used to investigate how investors construct their ass et allocation. The sample for empirical study is comprised of 20 major stock indexes from global markets as risky assets from 1998 to 2013. The DO strategy on average produces higher terminal wealth rather than does the buy-and-hold (BH) strategy, but the average utility (AU) of the former is worse than the latter. Nevertheless, using the OP strategy not only increases the terminal wealth of investors but also generates higher utility. Given a starting investment of one dollar and considering the best 100 trading rules, the DO and OP strategies result in average terminal wealth of 17.6 dollars and 5.9 dollars, respectively. In addition, in terms of AU, both of them are better than the BH strategy. These pieces of evidence demonstrate that investors who use an appropriate strategy of technical analysis in ass et allocation can produce good economic value, a finding that supports the continued use of technical analysis in practice. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",economic benefit; portfolio; technical analysis; trading strategy,capital flow; capital formation; capital market; cost-benefit analysis; investment; stock market; valuation

We simulate real-life trading by applying STGP to millisecond data of the three highest capitalized stocks: Apple, Exxon Mobil, and Google and observe that profit opportunities at the millisecond time frame are better modelled through an evolutionary process involving natural selection, adaptation, learning, and dynamic evolution than by using conventional analytical techniques. We use combinations of forecasting techniques as benchmarks to demonstrate that different heuristics enable artificial traders to be ecologically rational, making adaptive decisions that combine forecasting accuracy with speed. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",adaptive market hypothesis; efficient market hypothesis; evolutionary computation; genetic programming; high-frequency trading; market efficiency,Malus x domestica; adaptive management; financial market; hypothesis testing; price dynamics; stock market

We also find differences in the lending ability of various bank types and loan types. By using direct information asymmetry measure, we find that banks reduced lending after the global financial crisis shock. However, the information gathered from the previous relationship of the borrower with relatively low exposure banks can overcome the negative financial shock and increase lending after the shock. These findings are very relevant in the context of the spillover effects of the GFC and have important policy implications for emerging markets. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",banks; financial contagion; financial crisis; information asymmetry,Pakistan; asymmetric information; banking; data set; financial crisis; firm size; global economy; lending behavior; spillover effect

Using several simulation settings, we highlight that quantifying risk by means of assets' Shapley values, that is, assets' contributions to overall portfolio risk, instead of classic measures supplies a (more) positive risk-return relationship in many practically relevant cases. This is partially attributable to the fact that the game-theoretic risk measure captures more investment-relevant information than commonly used alternatives. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",cooperative game theory; low-risk puzzle; Shapley value,finance; game theory; investment; price dynamics; risk factor; trade-off
Do foreign portfolio capital flows affect domestic investment?

After the crisis, a period marked first by a shift in economic policy in 2008–2009, with substantial increases in government intervention, followed by deterioration in the institutional outlook and political stability in 2014–2015, mostly against the backdrop of the Petrobras corruption scandal, unexpected shocks to EFPI no longer led any real effects on investment growth. Although, in general, our results vouch for beneficial effects of equity capital flows on investment, this virtuous relationship is likely disturbed by interventionist policies and political unrest. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",aggregate investment; emerging markets; financial integration; foreign portfolio capital flows; global financial crisis; government interventionism,Brazil; capital flow; economic integration; financial crisis; investment; state role; time series analysis

More importantly, how financial sector development mediates the relationship between sectoral value additions and trade remains an unexplored area. This study addresses these gaps in the literature relying on panel data from 46 countries in Africa spanning 1980–2016. Our evidence based on the pooled mean group estimations suggest that, for both the long and short run, although the impact of sectoral value additions is contingent on the proxy of trade, financial sector development does not have a significant effect on international trade. This holds irrespective of the measure of finance and international trade. However, after controlling for the transmission channels, a coexistence of a negative long run substitutionarity between finance and trade is found, and this is invariant of the indicator of finance and trade. On the mediation role, we find that higher sectoral value additions dampen the deleterious effect of finance on trade with huge impact emanating from the service sector. We discuss some key implications for policy. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",exports; financial development; sectoral value additions; trade; trade openness,Africa; estimation method; export; financial system; international trade; trade openness

We hypothesize that, on average, domestic arrangers are better able to structure and screen project finance deals, credibly communicate the true value of a project and its underlying network of contracts, and monitor the loan contract compared with foreign arrangers. If so, all things being equal, domestic arranger certification should result in lower loan spreads compared with foreign arranger certification. Our results support this hypothesis. After controlling for project and loan characteristics and the potential endogeneity of the lead arranger's selection, we find that certification by domestic arrangers causes a significant reduction in loan spreads across different industrial categories and geographic locations of projects. This finding demonstrates the economic value of domestic arranger certification in project finance lending. Our results suggest that, in the presence of information asymmetry between project sponsors and participant lenders in the syndicate, certification by domestic arrangers offers a superior mechanism to minimize search, information, and monitoring costs. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",asymmetric information; certification; emerging markets; financial intermediaries; loan pricing; mandated lead arranger; project finance; syndicated lending,certification; development project; financial market; lending behavior; price determination

This study examines whether there are differences in the disclosure of shareholder and stakeholder CG practices. Based on a hand-collected dataset of 1,110 firm years in South Africa and a disclosure index using 72 CG provisions from the King III report of CG, we find that the disclosure of stakeholder CG practices is higher than that of shareholder CG practices. Our evidence suggests that foreign ownership, institutional ownership, racial diversity, and gender diversity increase total voluntary disclosure. In contrast, chief executive officer (CEO) age decreases total voluntary disclosure. Also, although foreign ownership, institutional ownership, gender diversity, and racial diversity increase both shareholder and stakeholder CG disclosures, CEO age has a negative relationship with both shareholder and stakeholder CG disclosures. Further, board size reduces shareholder disclosure but not stakeholder disclosure. Our results further indicate that, ceteris paribus, the extent of shareholder CG disclosure relative to stakeholder CG disclosure is (a) lower with board size, gender diversity, and racial diversity and (b) higher with the level of institutional ownership.

Tail dependence networks of global stock markets,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055503434&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1679&partnerID=40&md5=94f9bd46a9732a8a76582beebf4eedc4,"The Pearson correlation coefficient is used by many researchers to construct complex financial networks. However, it is difficult to capture the structural characteristics of financial markets that have extreme fluctuations. To solve this problem, we resort to tail dependence networks. We first build the edge information of the stock network by adopting Pearson's correlation coefficient and the symmetrized Joe–Clayton copula model, respectively. By using the planar maximally filtered graph method, we filter the edge information, obtain Pearson's correlation coefficient and tail dependence network, and compare their efficiencies. The community structure of the constructed networks is investigated. We find that the global efficiency of tail-dependent networks is higher than that of the Pearson correlation networks. Further analysis of the nodes in the upper- and lower-tail dependence networks reveals that the European markets are more influential than Asian and African markets during a booming market and a recession market. In addition, different cliques are found in the two tail dependence networks. The finding indicates that financial risks will impact geographically adjacent markets. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",community structure; complex network; Pearson's correlation coefficient; SJC copula; stock market,Africa; Asia; Europe; correlation; financial market; stock market
Volatility spillovers between real exchange rate returns and real stock price returns in Malaysia,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055263487&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1653&partnerID=40&md5=da64bb83026da9f0dd4caea69efa6b6d,"This study analyses volatility spillovers between real exchange rate returns and real stock price returns in Malaysia. The component-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model with asymmetric effect is used to decompose volatility into permanent or long-run component and transitory or short-run component. Permanent and transitory components of volatility are commonly high in the global financial crisis, 2008. The results of the seemingly unrelated regressions framework show that volatility spillovers of permanent component between real exchange rate returns and real stock price returns are stronger than volatility spillovers of transitory component between real exchange rate returns and real stock price returns. Moreover, volatility spillovers of permanent and transitory components between real Malaysian ringgit against the U.S. dollar return and real stock price returns are stronger than real Malaysian ringgit against the Japanese yen exchange rate return and real stock price returns. There is some evidence of Granger causality between real exchange rate returns and real stock price returns.

Stock return volatility and capital structure measures of nonfinancial firms in a dynamic panel model: Evidence from Pakistan,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055248670&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1682&partnerID=40&md5=1e09da108d1b6901c75e77367fa7380c,"We investigate the impact of stock return volatility on different capital structure measures of nonfinancial firms in a dynamic panel model. Two-step system generalized method of moment dynamic panel estimator is applied to nonfinancial sector's data from Pakistan Stock Exchange over the period 2001–2014. The results imply that stock return volatility has a significant negative impact on book leverage and long-term market leverage ratios. However, stock return volatility causes the increase in total market leverage ratios. Moreover, book leverage and long-term market leverage of firms decrease as a result of an increase in stock return volatility in different classification of firms. Conversely, stock return volatility has a significant positive impact on total market leverage ratios in those classifications of firms. Capital structure decisions are more sensitive to stock return volatility as default risk increases. Firms significantly go for the reduction in their debt financing due to high stock returns volatility and to avoid from possible consequences of default. The results are robust to alternative measures such as cash flow volatility and earnings volatility. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",capital structure measures; dynamic panel model; nonfinancial firms; stock return volatility; system GMM,Pakistan; capital market; estimation method; numerical model; panel data; stock market
Does financial market growth improve income distribution?

For this reason, the study utilizes annual data that range from 1981 to 2014 on the selected indicators. Given the nature of our variables, we employ panel autoregressive distributed lag models to explore the long-run estimates of income inequalities. The long-run estimates indicate that the stock market indicators have significant positive and negative impact on income inequalities in developed and emerging market economies, respectively. Further, our findings show that the banking credit adversely affects income inequalities both in developed and emerging economies. Our results also establish significant short-run causalities among stock market indicators and income inequalities. Given these findings, we argue that the stock markets are playing an important role in reducing income inequalities in emerging economies whereas they contribute for higher inequalities in developed economies. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",banking credit; developed-emerging market economies; FDI inflows; income inequalities; panel ARDL; stock market indicators,banking; comparative study; economic growth; financial market; foreign direct investment; income distribution; market development; stock market; wage gap
What does unconventional monetary policy do to stock markets in the euro area?,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055250530&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1669&partnerID=40&md5=ab04abb67726442d28725a772ff290bd,"This paper investigates the impact of the European Central Bank's unconventional monetary surprises on major European stock markets. Three measures for surprises are used: (a) the change in domestic 10-year government bond yields, (b) the change in the spread between German and Italian (Spanish) 10-year bond yields, and (c) the change in yields of a safe euro-denominated asset, such as German bonds. I show that unconventional monetary policy surprises significantly influence stock returns. For instance, monetary decisions that cause a decrease in Italian (Spanish) sovereign spread led to an increase in the stock returns. In addition, I find that a positively surprising shock—a fall in the domestic bond yield and an increase in German interest rates—leads to higher stock returns. Finally, sovereign spreads seemed to have larger effects on stock returns both during crisis and postcrisis years. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",ECB; EGARCH; monetary surprises; stock prices,Europe; Germany; Italy; Spain; central bank; economic impact; European Monetary Union; European Union; exchange rate; interest rate; monetary policy; stock market
Common idiosyncratic volatility and returns: From an investment horizon perspective,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054639969&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1668&partnerID=40&md5=2d379019be4fed0ed25702a93b59b6da,"“Idiosyncratic risk–return puzzle” is conflicting and confusing. It becomes more complex by the introduction of the common idiosyncratic volatility (CIV). We shed new light on the issue from the perspective of heterogeneity of investors with different investment horizons. We study the “CIV puzzle” with Chinese A-Share market evidence and further contribute by employing the wavelet multiresolution analysis framework to decompose the overall CIV into timescales that refer to risks in different terms. We apply these timescales in Fama–Macbeth regressions to investigate their pricing effects. The results suggest that the “CIV puzzle” is an investment horizon specification problem. The relationship between returns and common idiosyncratic risk is negative in the short run, positive in the intermediate run, and then negative again in the longer run. We also contribute to the international empirical evidence with an in-depth analysis of the Chinese stock market over the period 1999–2016. The results are robust across different specifications of the CIV.

We show that stability is not monotonic against competition, and may increase and decrease at high competition, has a mixed behaviour at medium competition, and increases at low competition. This non-monotonic stability behaviour at different competition levels is attributed to the intervention quality, which is found to be an important determinant of the competition–stability relation. It is non-linearly related to and being revised at different competition levels. As intervention is a policy variable, its level can be adjusted to reduce the competition effects on stability. We illustrate that for the U.S. banking sector, the intervention quality has to hedge these competition effects. Regulators should treat intervention quality as a “hedging instrument” against the destabilizing competition effects. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",banking stability; competition; intervention quality; non-linearity; semi-parametric estimation,Canada; United Kingdom; United States; banking; competition (economics); estimation method; financial policy; nonlinearity

There is a growing literature on the effects of income inequality on financial crises. This study provides significant evidence in favour of a positive relationship between income inequality and financial fragility, when particular factors are controlled for. Complementary findings also suggest that (a) debt accumulation in the private sector significantly depends on credit expansion, (b) the debt levels of the private sector and households co-move over time, and (c) financial deregulation significantly contributes to financial instability. Therefore, policymakers should take into account regulatory reforms that will promote institutional and financial innovations to restrict debt accumulation and render the financial system more robust to destabilising shocks. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",debt accumulation; financial deregulation; financial instability; income inequality; OECD,credit provision; debt; equity; income distribution; OECD; private sector; regulatory framework

Furthermore, investor trading behaviour has strongest effects on stocks with highest crash risk and highest idiosyncratic risk and has weakest effects on stocks with lowest crash risk and lowest idiosyncratic risk, which indicates that investors gamble lottery-like stocks with high crash risk and high idiosyncratic risk.

The value of the dollar peg is typically positive for the dollar bloc because the United States can no longer improve its terms of trade at the dollar bloc's expense. This provides a rationale for fixing the exchange rate.

We also reveal evidence of structural changes in the dynamics of Bitcoin. After accounting for the structural breaks in the level series, evidence of mean reversion is uncovered in some cases. Further analyses show evidence of a long memory in the two measures of volatility (absolute and the squared returns), whereas some cases of short memory are revealed in the squared returns series in particular.

The purpose of our analysis is fourfold: First, we investigate the consistency of exchange rate data by comparing the rates available from The Commercial and Financial Chronicle at daily frequency with those provided by Einzig (1937). Although Einzig is a widely used source, the daily rates of the currencies of countries that witnessed episodes of hyperinflation during the interwar period, reported in The Chronicle, have not been examined previously. Second, we scrutinize the commentaries offered by The Chronicle to shed light on the impact of news on the behaviour of the German mark–U.S. dollar exchange rate over the interwar German hyperinflation and to check whether the narrative analysis provided therein is consistent with formal econometric analyses in dating when the probability of monetary reform became salient. This is crucial for the interpretation of the findings reported by previous studies of the German hyperinflation. Third, we focus on the commentaries that provide evidence on the volume of trade in German marks and on whether the quotations of the exchange rate of the mark against the U.S. dollar were purely notional in the final stages of the hyperinflation. Fourth, for the first time, we examine the behaviour of the real exchange rate of the German mark after the 1923 stabilization episode using data at weekly frequency. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",data consistency; date of monetary reform; exchange rates; German hyperinflation; hyperinflation; interwar European hyperinflations; purchasing power parity,

The current investigation examines three macroeconomic policies: (a) government spending, (b) liquidity provision, and (c) central bank interest rates by analysing 21 countries around the globe. The results suggest that government spending is a suboptimal macroeconomic policy for mitigating imbalances in financial markets, as it may have destabilizing effects. Liquidity provision was found to be ineffective in facilitating financial market stability whereas the adjustment of interest rates was found to be a viable tool for mitigating financial market imbalances. Therefore, an appropriate policy framework would comprise the following: prudent government spending, conditional liquidity provision, and a reduction in interest rates following the development of financial market disequilibria. Furthermore, this study found strong evidence against the notion that political orientations influence policy frameworks, which were designed to redress financial market disequilibria. This study also found that global financial integration does not influence the policymaking process. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",disequilibria; financial market; global financial integration; macroeconomic policies; political landscape,economic policy; financial market; interest rate; macroeconomics; policy making; politics

Effect of determinants on financial leverage in Indian steel industry: A study on capital structure,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054630460&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1671&partnerID=40&md5=5875024f83c1cc7a45823a8eac0013bf,"Because India is neither a developed country nor its steel companies are financially self-sufficient, they are bound to depend on the external capital, resulting the decision to be taken on the leverage ratio as even more crucial. India being the top exporter of iron ores has the potential to be counted as one of the top exporters of steel if the steel companies follow optimal capital structure. Thus, the leverage ratio needs thorough investigation in order to decide the optimal capital structure. Although there have been some attempts, they are not extensive. The objective of this study is to empirically investigate the present capital structure of Indian steel industry from years 2010 until 2017 and the determinants of capital structure and how these determinants correlate with financial leverage. The research objectives are (1) to identify the significant determinants that affect the capital structure and (2) to conduct an extensive and empirical research in order to estimate the correlations of the determinants with the financial leverage. Seven key determinants have been found: They are profitability, asset structure, size, growth opportunities, non-debt tax shield, liquidity, and risk. The profitability is found to be highly correlated with the debt ratio as was expected and reported in previous studies. The correlations among the determinants such as asset structure, size, and non-debt tax shield are statistically significant. Profitability and liquidity carry positive relationship with debt ratio, although there is a negative relationship between debt ratio and asset structure. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",capital structure; determinants; financial leverage; Indian steel industry; statistical analysis,India; capital; debt; iron and steel industry; iron ore; statistical analysis
Topological applications of multilayer perceptrons and support vector machines in financial decision support systems,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054770407&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1675&partnerID=40&md5=65cc21aa9be1acef4cbfe745cb269292,"                             The heart of this study is particularly on risk assessment of financial decision support systems (FDSSs), to advance the model performance and improve classification accuracy. To conquer the downsides of the classical models, statistical intelligence (SI) technologies, for example, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and support vector machines (SVMs), have been deliberated in FDSS applications. Recently, the prestigiousness of SI approaches has been confronted by the latest prediction learners. Therefore, to ensure the competitive performance of SI mechanisms, the current investigation scrutinizes the topological applications of MLPs and SVMs over eight different databases with equivalent combinations in credit scoring and bankruptcy predictions example sets. The experimental results reveal that MLP                             5                             -5 and MLP                             4                             -4, that is, the sigmoid activation function with five and four hidden layers, are the feasible topologies for the MLP algorithm, and on all databases in all performance criterions, SVM trained with the linear kernel function (SVM-1) achieves better prediction results. From the “Baseline” family, random forest learner brings significant improvements in financial decisions. Lastly, FDSSs are found to be correlated with the nature of databases and the performance criterions of the trained algorithms. The results of this study, however, have practical and managerial implications to make a range of financial and nonfinancial strategies. With these contributions, therefore, our study not only supplements earlier evidence but also enhances the predictive performance of SI algorithms for financial decision support applications.                          © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bankruptcy predictions; credit scoring; financial decision support systems; multilayer perceptrons; statistical intelligence; support vector machines; topological applications,accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; bankruptcy; classification; decision support system; financial system; geostatistics; support vector machine

The autoregressive distributed lag approach to cointegration is employed to specify the short- and long-run determinants of income growth. The main empirical results suggest that beside the growth in exports, which is the emphasis of the export-led growth models, growth in capital inflows and relative prices have also played important roles in the growth process in South Korea. A formal test of the model confirmed the validity of the results.

It finds a strong statistical relationship between cross-border flows and the decoupling of these two variables—the Great Leveraging—a stylized fact documented for several economies in the past decades, due to faster credit than money growth, and associated with the expansion of banks nonmonetary liabilities. Results indicate that, in addition to the equity/debt breakdown, it is important to split capital flows according to the domestic recipient sectors: banking sector flows display, in general, a stronger correlation with the growth of credit and with its excess growth over money. Furthermore, the country's FX regime also plays a role, as money holdings tend to be less responsive to cross-border capital flows in fixed FX regimes. In broad terms, this approach sheds light on the mechanisms through which the international banking activity might have consequences for the composition of the domestic aggregate bank balance sheet. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",capital flows; credit and money; financial integration; financial stability,banking; capital flow; credit provision; financial system
How has the global financial crisis affected syndicated loan terms in emerging markets?

Before the crisis, China adopted banking reforms allowing the entry of foreign banks and more domestic participation in the syndicated loan market. As a result, during the crisis, the volume of syndicated loans grew steadily, in contrast to other countries. In addition, the amount of foreign syndicated loans decreased and average maturity increased compared with the pre-crisis period. Our findings provide useful information to policy makers for devising effective responses to financial crises. © 2018 The Authors International Journal of Finance & Economics Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",China; financial crisis; loan amount; loan maturity; loan spread,
Effect of investor inattention on price drifts following analyst recommendation revisions,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054483465&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1666&partnerID=40&md5=26782ed3920066e46075ccfcdde609d6,"The study explores stock price dynamics after analyst recommendation revisions. Following the previous literature that documents significant post-recommendation stock price drifts and attributes them to investor inattention to company-specific events, I hypothesize that if on the day when a recommendation revision with respect to a stock was issued, the sign of the stock's abnormal return was opposite to the direction of the revision, then it means that investors were especially inattentive to the revision and that the subsequent price drift should be more pronounced. Analysing a large sample of analyst recommendation revisions, I document that recommendation revisions accompanied by the opposite-sign event-day abnormal returns are followed by significantly greater post-event price drifts in the direction of the revision, the magnitude of the drifts increasing for longer post-event periods. This effect is stronger for small and more volatile stocks and remains robust after accounting for additional company-specific (size, Market Model beta, and historical volatility) and event-specific (number of recommendation categories changed in the revision and analyst experience) factors. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",analyst recommendation revisions; behavioural finance; investor inattention; stock price drifts,financial services; hypothesis testing; investment; literature review; price dynamics; stock market

Changes in VIX negatively affect EM returns, which also significantly affect VIX changes. We find that VIX changes and EM returns collectively have predictive ability for each other. Further, VIX shocks contribute 22–42% to the prediction error of EM returns.

Magnitude of significant covariates changes across the size categories of both bankrupt and financially distressed firms. Further, operating cash flow information does not add any marginal increment in prediction performance of multivariate hazard models above baseline models developed using information from income statements and balance sheets.

This phenomenon can be called the “cross-market holiday effect,” and this study investigates it in detail, providing evidence for the existence of a strong cross-market holiday effect in the pan-European equity markets. The analysis provides an in-depth examination of other aspects like lagged volumes, market capitalization, or multistep ahead modelling. The trading volumes on dates when there is at least one cross-market holiday are on average 8.5% lower than the volumes of the previous period. There are salient effects when the holiday takes place in a dominant market or when most of the European markets are shut. We test whether the lower trading activity on Monday cross-market holidays is a consequence of the weekend effect or whether the Monday bank holidays push down the Monday trading volume. We report a significantly lower volume associated with the Monday bank holidays, and we argue that the weekend effect has an insignificant impact on the Monday volumes where there is at least one regional cross-market holiday. © 2018 The Authors International Journal of Finance & Economics Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",behavioural finance; cross-market holiday effect; European stock market; holiday effect; international market comovement; ridge regression; trading volume,

Yet the challenge is to understand the effects of intraday news flow on dealers' quoting behaviour, high-frequency returns, price volatility, liquidity, and trading activity. This paper addresses these issues shortly before the analyst recommendation changes on the Nasdaq. The sample period is 2004 at times where dealers were frequently displaying their quotations on the system. Results show that dealers remain active in quoting, in particular, in the events when the report is issued by their affiliated analysts. Their activity is associated with lower inside spreads, more trading, a more two-sided market, and lower order imbalance. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Dealers' quotations; market liquidity; price volatility; regulation; trading activity,

We also explore the potential channels through which the industrial structure may affect an economy's vulnerability to external shocks. The result of the analysis suggests that a higher share of the service sector substantially increases vulnerability to a banking crisis through deterioration in profits and worsening of the current account balance. Our study provides some implications for the recent acceleration of deindustrialization in several emerging and advanced economies: for example, the industrial policy should call for a more cautious approach to reduce the potential risks of deindustrialization (increase in crisis vulnerability). © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",banking crisis; deindustrialization; industrial structure,banking; deindustrialization; economic impact; financial crisis; industrial investment; industrial structure; vulnerability

We find that NPLs in the euro area have performed an upward (much higher in the periphery) shift after 2008 and are mostly related to worsening macroeconomic conditions. A chi-square test comparing the estimated coefficients for the core and periphery NPLs rejects the hypothesis of equality revealing another aspect of financial fragmentation in the euro area that leaves the periphery more vulnerable.

The analysis is conducted over a period of 10 years in which the Indian banking sector has gone under different changes such as demonetization and issues related to banking sector sustainability and banking sector frauds. The analysis is based on balanced panel data over a period ranging from 2008 to 2017 for 69 commercial Indian banks. Profitability of Indian banks is measured by two proxies, namely, return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE), whereas bank size, assets quality, capital adequacy, liquidity, operating efficiency, deposits, leverage, assets management, and the number of branches are used as bank-specific factors. Further, a set of macroeconomic determinants such as gross domestic product, inflation rate, interest rate, exchange rate, financial crisis, and demonetization are used as independent variables. Stationary test along with pooled, fixed, random effect models and panel correction standard error are used in this study. The results revealed that bank size, the number of branches, assets management ratio, operational efficiency, and leverage ratio are the most important bank-specific determinants that affect the profitability of Indian commercial banks as measured by ROA. Furthermore, among the bank-specific determinants, the results revealed that bank size, assets management ratio, assets quality ratio, and liquidity ratio are found to have a significant positive impact on ROE. With regard to the macroeconomic determinants, the results revealed that the inflation rate, exchange rate, the interest rate, and demonization are found to have a significant impact on ROA. However, in the case of ROE, the results show that all macroeconomic determinants except demonization have a significant impact on the bank's profitability as measured by ROE. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bank-specific; commercial bank; demonetization; financial crisis; India; profitability,India; banking; commercialization; equity; inflation; macroeconomics; panel data; profitability; sustainability
Currency risk premia: Perceptions of downside risk and deviations from benchmark values,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052369304&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1647&partnerID=40&md5=65df216c6f5670c3c92d3fc5c0e13a06,"This paper examines the empirical performance of an alternative model of the currency risk premium. This model relates risk not to the variance of returns but rather to potential crash risk based on the deviation, or “gap,” between the exchange rate and perceptions of its benchmark value. The model is tested using a novel data set of traders' exchange rate forecasts, from 1986:08 to 2013:09. The forecast data eliminate the need for a joint hypothesis about expectations formation through direct measurement of the market's ex ante premium. To measure the benchmark value, rather than use purchasing power parity, we relate it to recent levels through a moving average. Strong support is found for the prediction that the premium comoves positively with the “gap” measure of risk, according to cointegrated vector autoregression analyses for all four markets examined. This result is robust for moving averages from six to 24 months and when controlling for exchange rate volatility. The findings suggest how investors assess downside risk ex ante, at least in part, and may rationalize the application of certain technical analysis. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",CVAR; exchange rates; IKE gap model; risk premia; survey data; technical analysis,benchmarking; cointegration analysis; exchange rate; numerical model; perception; survey method; vector autoregression
Spillover effects of credit default risk in the euro area and the effects on the Euro: A GVAR approach,2019,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054814132&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1663&partnerID=40&md5=f1dea6303d3e2c336c0a88c34b848ead,"During the 2008 financial crisis, increasing risk and spillovers became a main concern for policy makers and banks. In addition, changes in sovereign and bank risk are believed to have had strong effects on world-wide exchange rates. This paper aims to analyse these dynamics empirically. We estimate a Global VAR (GVAR) model for nine EMU countries plus Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States and identify structural risk shocks using sign restrictions. Our results indicate that spillover effects of general risk are much stronger than those of bailouts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Euro depreciates significantly against the Yen and U.S. dollar following general risk shocks in the euro area and only to a small extent following bailout shocks. The Pound Sterling is not affected by any of these shocks. The Euro variability is, from the EMU perspective, mainly driven by shocks stemming from large countries (e.g., Germany, France, and Italy). However, shocks from third countries also play an important role. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bailouts; credit default swaps; exchange rates; Global VAR; sign restrictions,Japan; United Kingdom; United States; banking; credit provision; exchange rate; financial crisis; policy making; regression analysis; spillover effect

The proposed model compares countries based on specified factors and gives a score for each country. To set out the factors, after investigating on quite a lot of related studies, several macroeconomic factors are gathered, and the most important ones are selected for further investigation. An important advantage of the proposed model is that it can be solved manually by managers, investors, or researchers without a need for any professional optimization solver software. The key factor in this research is developing a mathematical model that ranks any set of countries rather than rating them. At the end of pair comparison, countries are ranked from higher to lower scores from the economical point of view. In addition, the accuracy of the obtained result is validated by comparing them with Moody's rating system (August 2016) using Jaccard similarity index.

We develop a model that formalizes a mechanism to allow for the influence of external debt in the transmission of FDI-generated externalities and conduct threshold regressions to test the existence of a debt contingency effect that limits the positive impact of inward FDI on growth. With the use of annual as well as 5-year averaged data for 39 developing countries over the period 1984–2010, our findings support the hypothesis that FDI-induced growth is dependent on the external debt constraint. In particular, we show that beyond a certain threshold high indebtedness constrains economies from reaping growth benefits from FDI as they seek to reduce their debt levels. In this scenario, the evidence also shows that increasing financial development can mitigate the negative influence of high external debt on the FDI–growth nexus. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Economic growth; external debt; foreign direct investment; threshold estimation,debt; developing world; economic growth; estimation method; financial system; foreign direct investment

Using data consisting of 1,623 Chinese mergers and acquisitions (M&As) deals, we show that politically connected financial advisors create significantly higher market value for acquiring firms, after controlling for firms' own political connections and reputation. Further analysis indicates that the appointment of political advisers can improve an acquiring firm's long-term industry-adjusted operating performance and help acquirers reduce bid premiums. We show that private firms and stock-pay acquisitions are more likely to appoint politically connected financial advisors in M&A transactions, whereas our findings remain unchanged after controlling for endogeneities. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",acquisition performance; financial advisors; mergers and acquisitions; political connection; value creation,China; financial system; firm size; industrial investment; industrial performance; merger; performance assessment
Capital flow management policies in emerging market economies: Are they successful in mitigating drastic changes of capital flows?,2018,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052688793&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1629&partnerID=40&md5=922bed5209440441fd403b80f2e6660c,"This paper constructs a new database for capital flow management policies (CFMs) in 16 emerging market economies from 1999 to 2008 and analyses their effect on extreme capital flow movements. We show that CFMs are effective in mitigating drastic changes of capital flows. We also find that CFMs do not have significant impacts on capital flow volumes. The results suggest that CFMs could be employed as policy toolkits for mitigating extreme capital flow movements without distorting capital flows in a normal period. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",capital flows; CFMs; emerging market economies; sudden stops; surges,capital flow; database; economic policy; market conditions; policy analysis

The euro area bias and the role of financial centres,2018,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043302171&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1614&partnerID=40&md5=c58e3d795eb8e8d514669fe669589613,"This paper investigates the euro area bias—a stronger preference for euro area securities in the cross-border portfolio of euro area residents with respect to the prediction of an international finance gravity model. Compared with previous studies, we disentangle different partitions of the euro area and, crucially, isolate euro area financial centres, finding some novel results. First, the euro area bias is not always present and remarkably weak for securities issued by euro area high-rating economies, those that would be expected to provide better insurance during crisis periods. Second, the extent of the euro area bias could be overstated, because euro area financial centres may conceal round-tripping flows from euro area low-rating economies. Finally, in the case of equity, the euro area bias did not decline during the crisis period but, in the case of debt issued by euro area low-rating economies, unsurprisingly, weakened. The decline in exposure towards euro area debt securities was common among all cross-border investors, not a specific retrenchment of euro area investors. Overall, our results call for a prudent treatment of cross-border financial statistics in the presence of a financial centre bias.

The BRT algorithm endogenously selects the predictor variables used to proxy the information set of forecasters so as to maximize the predictive power for the forecast error. The BRT algorithm also accounts for a potential non-linear dependence of the forecast error on the predictor variables and for interdependencies between the predictor variables. Our main finding is that, given our set of predictor variables, the rational expectations hypothesis (REH) cannot be rejected for short-term forecasts and that there is evidence against the REH for longer term forecasts.

Unlike previous studies, it checks the robustness of the results by applying both time series and panel methods; moreover, it tests for both long- and short-run causality. In brief, the findings highlight significant differences between the two sets of countries reflecting the distinctive features of Islamic banks. Specifically, the time series analysis provides evidence of long-run causality running from credit to GDP in countries with Islamic banks. This is confirmed by the panel causality tests, although in this case short-run causality in countries without Islamic banks is also found. © 2018 The Authors International Journal of Finance & Economics Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",causality tests; credit; growth; Islamic banking,banking; credit provision; economic growth; empirical analysis; Gross Domestic Product; Islamism; time series analysis
Standard and optimized carry trades,2018,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043364491&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1619&partnerID=40&md5=34023a1d523eff8da23ce0039d24b957,"Drawdown periods of standard carry trades are primarily the result of losses in classic carry trade currencies. These periods coincide with an increased financial stress, such as the recent financial crisis. The introduced optimized carry trades employ a dynamic weighting scheme for currencies, which incorporates general risk components. Optimized carry trades are therefore less exposed to losses under financial stress, and provide an enhanced risk-return profile over the entire and second half of the sample period and during periods of volatile markets. These results find robust statistical evidence. Furthermore, optimized carry trades have a lower correlation with traditional asset classes than standard carry trades. Traditional models of risk are less successful in explaining the returns of optimized carry trades.

We utilize daily prices of stock market indices of 57 countries from January 1997 to August 2012 to establish both a minimum spanning tree network and graph network. We examine network features including connectivity and centrality through a variety of indicators. Our results clearly show that there has been a tendency over time for markets to become more integrated globally even during periods of market stress. The centrality results suggest that the U.S. and Hong Kong markets have been the most dominant markets in their geographic region. For Europe, we find 3 dominant centres, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany in contrast to previous literature suggesting that the United Kingdom was the dominant country. We further identify that Japan and Australia, instead of acting as dominant countries in their region, serve as bridging countries between the region and the rest of the world. Finally, we find that Africa does not form a cluster, and individual African countries tend to connect to other developed markets.

In addition, the yield spread provides information about the overall condition of the economy and may also be tied into the distribution of income. The paper's results show that increases in the yield spread and household debt correspond with increases in top income shares, resulting in increases in income inequality. However, as household debt and income inequality increase, the yield spread contracts, which suggests future economic contraction. Thus, rising inequality may signal future economic weakness.

Testing for nonlinear unit roots in the presence of a structural break with an application to the qualified PPP during the 1997 Asian financial crisis,2018,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041171914&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1613&partnerID=40&md5=5f7453f75da8695ef4307d52332b8d43,"This paper applies Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the size and power properties in the presence of a structural break, for the standard Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test versus nonlinear exponential smooth transition autoregressive unit root tests. The break causes the tests to be undersized, and the statistical power considerably decreases. Moreover, the effect is intensified in small samples and very much increased for more persistent nonlinear series. As a remedy, we modify the standard ADF and exponential smooth transition autoregressive unit root tests in order to adjust for a structural break. This improves both the power and the size considerably, even though the empirical size still is lower than the nominal one. More persistent series are more affected by structural breaks, and the new tests are most powerful under the existence of a rather persistent nonlinear data generating process (which is an empirically relevant and common type of data generating process). The proposed tests are applied to investigate mean reversion in the real effective exchange rates of 5 East and Southeast Asian countries, taking into account the structural change in exchange rate regime brought about by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The empirical findings corroborate our simulation results; the modified more powerful tests are able to reject the unit root in all 5 countries, whereas the tests that do not consider the structural break could only reject in one of these cases.

We find that bank capital structure corresponds to corporate finance theory and buffer view and, in particular, that market-to-book ratio, size, and risk are positively related and that profitability is negatively related to bank leverage. Banks in countries with higher tax advantages, creditor rights, deposit insurance, and bankruptcy codes have more leverage, and those bound by common law have less leverage.

The present value literature states that stock indices move due to changes either in discount rates, dividend growth, or a combination of the two. Empirically, little is known about the mechanism through which legal, institutional, and corporate financial factors influence these variables, especially in a European context. The current paper attempts to plug this gap in the literature. Using the state space approach, we show that although expected returns are highly persistent, expected dividend growth tends to vary across the sample. Movements in markets are mainly due to changes in the discount rate. However, there appears to be a difference in the proportion of movements attributable to discount rate and dividend growth components. Stock markets in civil law countries tend to have a stronger link with the dividend growth variables as well as market size and activity measures. Expected dividend growth is also driven by profitability factors in both types of country. By contrast, there is no strong evidence of corporate indicators influencing expected returns. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",European markets; financing; legal origins; present value; state space,Europe; economic growth; financial market; profitability; stock market

Enriching the VaR framework to EEMD with an application to the European carbon market,2018,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043318707&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1618&partnerID=40&md5=697ba24922c9208cd36e7dc5c13d1de8,"Unlike common financial markets, the European carbon market is a typically heterogeneous market, characterized by multiple timescales, and affected by extreme events. The traditional value-at-risk (VaR) with single-timescale fails to deal with the multi-timescale characteristics and the effects of extreme events, which can result in the VaR overestimation for carbon market risk. To measure accurately the risk on the European carbon market, we propose an ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)-based multiscale VaR approach. First, the EEMD algorithm is utilized to decompose the carbon price return into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different timescales and a residue, which are modelled, respectively, using the ARMA-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity model to obtain their conditional variances at different timescales. Furthermore, the Iterated Cumulative Sums of Squares algorithm is employed to determine the windows of an extreme event, so as to identify the IMFs influenced by an extreme event and conduct an exponentially weighted moving average on their conditional variations. Finally, the VaRs of various IMFs and the residue are estimated to reconstruct the overall VaR, the validity of which is verified later. Then, we illustrate the results by considering several European carbon futures contracts. Compared with the traditional VaR framework with single timescale, the proposed multiscale VaR-EEMD model can effectively reduce the influences of the heterogeneous environments (such as the influences of extreme events) and obtain a more accurate overall risk measure on the European carbon market. By acquiring the distributions of carbon market risks at different timescales, the proposed multiscale VaR-EEMD estimation is capable of understanding the fluctuation characteristics more comprehensively, which can provide new perspectives for exploring the evolution law of the risks on the European carbon market.

This effect significantly amplifies in small, young, and private companies, it is likely to persist over time, and it increased during the recent financial crisis.

Results suggest substantial and time-varying pass-through. Higher degrees of bidirectional pass-through occur between the federal funds rate to the user costs of more liquid assets—both in levels and volatilities. Federal funds rate spillovers propagate faster onto more liquid rates as well.

The market access of systemic banks and the fact that they were singled out for higher capital requirements seem to have biased them towards lower level capital, consistent with the theory that asymmetric information drives capital decisions. These effects are particularly strong for institutions that had a rather low level of capitalization at the start of the period and for those that exhibited a strong use of additional Tier I capital before the regulatory changes. Strict capital composition requirements for firms with lower buffers would be an improvement.

However, the application of quantile cointegration methods that estimate the equilibrium relationship between national prices and the nominal exchange rate is much more supportive of a generalized PPP condition that varies across countries and quantiles.

Reassessing the relationship between the financial sector and economic growth: Dynamic panel evidence,2018,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044720597&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1609&partnerID=40&md5=6fb88ae55767a9b554398289e43a90da,"Historically, the development of the financial sector has been an indispensable driver of economic growth. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, there is a pressing need to reassess the role of the financial sector in the determination of economic growth. Using a dynamic panel framework, our analysis covers 34 European and Commonwealth of Independent States economies for the period 1998–2014 and controls for the role of macroeconomic and institutional variables. Our evidence suggests that the potential benefits of the financial sector finance may have dramatically reversed in recent years, resulting in “un-creative destruction.” The results suggest, tentatively, that there has been a severance of the link between the financial sector and the real economy. The results, however, vary according to the level of economic development across the European and Commonwealth of Independent States economies. In the case of developing market economies, the financial intermediation proxies are not significant in explaining economic growth. The effect of changes in investment expenditure, the money supply, wages, unit labour costs, and trade openness is found to be strong and in line with a priori expectations across all country samples. Notably, government consumption is also found to be a significant driver of economic growth, except in the developing market economies in the period following the Great Recession. In line with the growing consensus in other research areas, we provide evidence of a robust role for the institutional framework proxied by the quality of governance in determining economic development.

"The volatility trap: Precautionary saving, investment, and aggregate risk",2018,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041204523&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1610&partnerID=40&md5=656b5650f13b8538929e575d206f0352,"We study the effects of permanent and temporary income shocks on precautionary saving and investment in a “store-or-sow” model of growth. High volatility of permanent shocks results in high precautionary saving in the safe asset and low investment or a “volatility trap,” namely, big savers invest relatively little. In contrast, low volatility of permanent shocks leads to low precautionary saving and high or low investment, depending on the volatility of temporary shocks. Empirical evidence shows a nonlinear relationship between investment and saving and that investment is a hump-shaped function of the volatility of permanent shocks, as predicted by the model.

Do credit ratings affect spread and return? A study of structured finance products,2018,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041213512&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1612&partnerID=40&md5=b55a7d39e85fe8f8800606610f96a9c4,"Although the previous studies investigating the relationship between credit ratings and spread or return in the financial market are normally restricted to noncausal measures, this paper uses structural equation modelling to test the possibility of causal links from ratings to spread and return in the context of structured finance products. Our analyses are split into 2 stages: First, we search for causality between ratings and spread at the issuance stage (primary market) based on a sample comprising all tranches of asset-backed securities issued in the United States by American and foreign institutions from December 1999 to December 2015. Then, we consider all ABS rating changes from February 2001 to December 2015 to check whether the assumption of causal connection between ratings and return at the trading stage (secondary market) is reasonable. After testing all pertinent combinations among the variables in our database, we find evidence of causality at the issuance stage but very little support to causality at the trading stage. This study contributes to the debate on the regulation of credit rating agencies as our findings suggest that ratings may have an effective influence on decisions made by investors at the time structure finance products are issued. As this effect is very weak when those assets are traded in the secondary market, in principle, regulators should focus their attention on the credit rating agencies' activities regarding the issuance of new structured products.

The growth rate series in Kenya: Evidence of non-linearities and factors behind the slow growth,2018,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040713025&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1606&partnerID=40&md5=4fff81f692fb276c4eeb1e83668088c8,"This paper deals with the growth rate in Kenya, examining its statistical properties and investigating the factors that may explain the slow growth rates observed during the last 50 years. The results show that Kenyan growth rate is unstable with non-linearities and long range dependence structures. We also investigate what might explain these features. In this regard, we conclude that the development of anomalous political institutions in Kenya in the decades after independence is the root cause that has led to subsequent weak economic institutions and macroeconomic mismanagement and the vulnerability of the Kenyan economy to domestic and external shocks.

The study considers established facts from the literature, such as calendar anomalies, the correlation between volume and price change, and this relation's asymmetry, while proposing a variety of time series models. The results identified some key volume predictors, such as the lagged time series volume data and historical price indicators (e.g. intraday range, intraday return, and overnight return). Moreover, the study provides empirical evidence for the price–volume relation asymmetry, finding an overall price asymmetry in over 70% of the analysed stocks, which is observed in the form of a moderate overnight asymmetry and a more salient intraday asymmetry. We conclude that volatility features, more recent data, and day-of-the-week features, with a notable negative effect on Mondays and Fridays, improve the volume prediction model. © 2018 The Authors.

Dividend policy and bank opacity,2018,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041232114&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1611&partnerID=40&md5=cbe0077be871d1783b77d78539280e7d,"Does dividend policy increase or decrease bank opaqueness? Under the Dividend–Transparency Channel, paying dividends involves banks having greater discipline from the markets due to external financing and reduces private benefits of control, leading to lower earnings management concerns. Under the Dividend–Opacity Channel, due to a hesitancy to change dividend policy, banks have high vocations to engage earnings management to circumvent payout policy restrictions in debt covenants or to keep their dividend target unchanged. Employing a large sample of 2,483 U.S. bank holding companies from 2001:Q1–2013:Q4, the study documents the double-edged sword of dividends on the discretionary behaviours of banks. Paying dividends makes banks less opaque to compare with nonpayers, which is consistent with the Dividend–Transparency Channel, however among dividend paying banks, excessive dividends involve banks to manage more their numbers, which is consistent with the Dividend–Opacity Channel. The findings are robust under different specifications. The results are of important interest to bank regulators.

On the stock market reactions to fiscal policies,2017,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031668334&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1584&partnerID=40&md5=7183455f00894f9e94cc9ec0318e09cb,"In this paper, a panel analysis is employed to investigate the effects of fiscal policies on stock market indexes in 11 members of the Eurozone. Many studies have focused on the effects of monetary policy on the stock market, whereas the number of contributions studying the effects of fiscal policy on the stock market is surprisingly limited. Therefore, we know little, if any, on the sign and stability of the stock market reaction to fiscal policies. Our results show that fiscal policies influence the stock market and that, following an increase (decrease) in public deficit, stock market indexes go down (up). Nevertheless, further analysis shows that the signs of the estimated stock market reactions are not constant over time and that they change according to the surrounding macroeconomic scenario.

Central bank swap lines and CIP deviations,2017,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031126222&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1596&partnerID=40&md5=f8f64d294ca9a452b1f781f45bf2381a,"We study the use of U.S. dollar central bank swap lines as a tool for addressing dislocations in the foreign currency swap market against the USD since the global financial crisis. We find that the use of the Federal Reserve's USD central bank swap lines was mainly related to tensions in U.S. money markets during times of financial crisis, and less to tensions that were confined to foreign exchange swap markets. In particular, we find that the use of USD central bank swap lines did not react significantly to the recent period of persistent deviations of covered interest parity since 2014. These results are consistent with the view that the Federal Reserve was guided by enlightened self-interest when providing swap lines to foreign central banks, in order to reduce dislocations in U.S. financial markets and support financial stability. In recent years, foreign exchange swap markets have not functioned properly, but it appears that now that the crisis is over, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have decided against trying permanently to fill the gap left by the dysfunction in the commercial foreign exchange swap market.

Nonetheless, banks have been able to maintain their overall level of profits, due to lower provisioning, which in turn may endanger financial stability.

Determinants of long- versus short-term bank credit in EU countries,2017,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031777856&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1583&partnerID=40&md5=b673aa026dfa8d3b82533ae04f6bf37d,"This paper empirically examines the determinants of credit at different maturities across countries of the European Union during the last decade. We document the lengthening of maturities since the early 2000s and whether these patterns were driven by similar factors in advanced and emerging market economies. Before the 2008 crisis, long-term credit expanded faster than short-term credit in most countries of our sample and contracted less than short-term credit after 2008. We find that foreign liabilities were more important sources of funding in emerging market countries than in advanced economies. In addition, aggregate demand mattered less for credit extension to firms in emerging market countries than in advanced countries.

This rule is such that nominal as well as real short-term interest rates increase in response to higher expected inflation or decline in output. Our findings show that the European Central Bank policy responses are of the same magnitude and sign as the ones prevailing in the pre-euro era for Germany, France, and Italy. We conclude that, before and after the euro, central banks in Europe have adopted a proactive stance towards controlling inflation.

We find that the magnitude of the country factor is greater than the magnitude of the industry factor for the period as a whole but that a company's level of international sales has a greater impact on the magnitude of its industry factor than the magnitude of its country factor. Counter-intuitively, we find stocks with lower sales exposure to their country of origin have a higher country factor, and we show the existence of both a strong local and international industry factor. Our results suggest country-of-origin diversification may no longer be sufficient to exploit country-specific risk and the country factor has become a “country classification” factor.

Our findings suggest that although the world market risk premium is insignificant on nonannouncement days, it is strongly significant on US macroeconomic announcement days. In addition, we find that US monetary policy announcements are the most important macroeconomic announcements to drive the world market risk premium.

Using a fully balanced panel of 24 economies from 1983 to 2013, the study shows that when imposing a linear relationship, the financial development and economic growth are negatively associated in the long run. The panel granger causality tests establish the bidirectional causality between the financial development variables with growth. Employing an alternate approach of moderated mediation effect framework, we notice that the association of financial development with economic growth is moderated by the negative impacts of inflation, interest rate, and population dependency; and the positive mediation effect of trade openness. The policy implication is that there is a need to rein in inflation and real interest rates and enhance trade openness to optimize the benefits of growing financial development on economic growth.

The evidence around market liquidity timing ability is similar although it is slightly less prevalent compared to volatility timing. Here, funds lower the fund market beta in anticipation of reduced market liquidity. We also find a positive relation between liquidity timing ability and fund abnormal performance where skilled liquidity timers outperform unskilled timers by around 3% p.a.—though this finding is driven by poor liquidity timing funds going on to yield negative alpha. However, despite the evidence of volatility and liquidity timing ability among funds, we fail to find in support of persistence in this timing. We find little evidence supporting market return timing ability.

Using a general class of regime-dependent models, we find that volatility can be disaggregated into distinct components: a persistent stable process with low sensitivity to shocks and a high volatility process capturing rather short-lived rare events. Out-of-sample forecasts show that, once regime shifts are accounted for, accuracy is improved compared to the standard generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity or the historical volatility model. Volatility plays an important role in controlling and monitoring financial risks. Therefore, by means of a risk management application, we illustrate the economic value and the practical implications of risk control ability of the models in terms of value at risk. Finally, tests for predictability in co-movements in the tails of stock index returns suggest that large losses are strongly correlated, supporting asymmetric transmission processes for financial contagion in the left tail of return distributions, whereas contagion in reverse direction (gains) is weak.

Despite time deformation and GARCH being mean and variance equation phenomena, respectively, they are argued herein to share a common motivation relating to the examination of changes in the temporal evolution of time-series processes. Via extensive simulation analysis, a close connection between the two concepts is established. It is found that the presence of GARCH can result in the spurious detection of time deformation, particularly when examining the heavy-tailed distributions and volatile data typically considered in empirical finance. It is shown that although the application of heteroskedasticity corrected covariance matrix estimators often increases, rather than corrects, the detected oversizing of the tests of time deformation, the application of GARCH filters does provide a solution to size distortion. The findings of the experimental analysis are drawn upon to provide a robust empirical examination of the London housing market where evidence of overwhelming and widespread nonlinearity is detected in the form of time deformation. The implications of these findings for the conduct of future, and the interpretation of previous, research are discussed.

This paper seeks to clarify whether the effect of the governance-related variables on firm performance varies across stock and cooperative banks in Japan. We consider regional banks as a proxy of stock banks and Shinkin banks, one of the representative co-ops, as a proxy of cooperative banks. We use cost and profit efficiency scores obtained from stochastic frontier analysis as performance measures. The results in this paper confirmed that having a large number of board members has negative effects on efficiency measures for both stock and cooperative banks. On the other hand, the presence of outside directors has a significant effect on efficiency measures for cooperative banks, whereas such variables have no significant effect for stock banks. These results suggest that outside directors' discipline is more necessary for cooperative banks than for stock banks, which are under strong pressure from shareholders. For cooperative banks, a high ratio of representative council members, which is the most important decision-making body for Shinkin banks, has negative effects on efficiency measures. Our findings support the current proposals of the financial regulatory authorities' council to appoint outside directors to the board as a means for strengthening governance of the co-ops.

Our key finding is that electricity futures can effectively manage risk only for specific time periods when using hedging strategies that have been very successful in financial and other commodity markets. More generally, they are ineffective as a risk management tool when compared with other energy assets. This is especially true at the weekly frequency. We also find significant differences in both the optimal hedge ratios and the hedging effectiveness of the different electricity markets. Better performance is found for the Nordpool market, whereas the poorest performer in hedging terms is the Phelix market.

Does credit information sharing affect funding cost of banks?

Employing a two-step generalized method of moments regression of 233 banks in 17 African countries, the study provides new revelations. The study shows that the quality of credit information shared is key and persistent in reducing funding cost of banks. Again, the study confirms that the coverage of private credit bureaus significantly reduced bank funding cost whereas no such evidence was found for coverage of public credit registries. Further, although the study found evidence to support that the presence of credit information reduces bank funding cost, no evidence was found to support that countries that use both private credit bureaus and public credit registries are able to reduce funding cost of banks in Africa. From these results, it is evident that credit information sharing presence, coverage, and quality reduces funding cost in Africa. For policy recommendations, policymakers and bank boards must team up and set up credit information sharing institutions to help reduce information asymmetry and funding cost in countries that do not share credit information. Also, the introduction and establishment of credit information sharing must be geared towards private bureaus as they are more effective in reducing funding cost of banks. Again, policymakers must enact laws and policies that deepen the coverage, depth, and quality of credit information shared so that the financial sector of Africa countries can realize the full potential of credit information sharing.

Finally, during the after structure break period, the volatility can be easily affected by bad news, and the investors have the lower profit or even the greater loss and bear the greater risk and variation of risk owing to the global financial crisis caused by the US. On the basis of the above findings, some policy implications are offered in this study.

And how do they affect financial stress indicators? This paper tackles these questions empirically, using information from 179 episodes of public debt spikes between 1945 and 2014. We find that large public debt spikes are neither driven by high primary deficits nor by output declines but instead by stock-flow adjustments. These blind spots in debt dynamics are sizable in both advanced economies and emerging markets and could amount to more than 20% of gross domestic product in the median episode. These public debt spikes increase financial stress indicators significantly, in particular when a large share of public debt is held by domestic commercial banks. Enhanced transparency and better debt forecasting tools could help address financial market tensions resulting from blind spots in debt dynamics.

To that end, instead of using market indexes from different investment areas, we employ exchange trade funds actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange in recent years. It avoids nonsynchronous problems as well as allowing us to allocate internationally on a daily basis for which this approach is especially appropriate.

We propose an optimization algorithm that makes small (fixed) adjustments to the time series of the market, size, value, and momentum factors, which ensures a zero alpha for any (single) self-designated benchmark index of a mutual fund. Our “adjusted factors” can then be used to estimate a mutual fund's “adjusted alpha.” We test this methodology on a sample of 1,281 active and 102 tracker U.S. equity mutual funds (reporting S&P 500 index as their prospectus benchmark). Our time series adjustment of the Carhart 4 factors leads to an increase (decrease) in a fund's “adjusted alpha” in periods of fund-benchmark underperformance (outperformance). On the whole, our “adjusted alphas” of both active and tracker funds are statistically significantly negative. This is particularly pronounced for tracker funds.

Political risk plays a highly significant role in explaining split ratings and dominates economic and financial indicators. Out-of-sample model performance is enhanced by capturing political risk. Government information disclosure affects split ratings between Moody's and Fitch in emerging countries.

Monetary policy and leverage shocks,2017,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010815580&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1571&partnerID=40&md5=f6c60c3ce9a49ef9554f1d3afa13658a,"The current mainstream approach to monetary policy in the United States is based on the new Keynesian model and is expressed in terms of the federal funds rate. It ignores the role of financial intermediary leverage (or collateral rates). But as the federal funds rate has reached the zero lower bound, the issue is whether there is a useful role of leverage in monetary policy and business cycle analysis. Motivated by these considerations and by recent financial intermediary asset pricing theories in this paper, we investigate the macroeconomic effects of broker–dealer leverage and the interdependence between monetary policy and broker–dealer leverage in the context of a structural vector autoregression model, using quarterly U.S. data over the period from 1967:1 to 2014:3. We address the simultaneity problem of identifying monetary policy and leverage shocks by using a combination of short-run and long-run restrictions. We also use the sign restriction approach to the identification of shocks to distinguish between leverage supply and leverage demand shocks, as one would expect the macroeconomic effects of these two types of leverage shocks to be quite different. Our results show that monetary policy and broker–dealer leverage demand shocks produce results that capture reasonable macroeconomic dynamics.

However, firms located in emerging European countries perform even worse after the IPO than firms located in developed European countries. Our results suggest that this less successful post-issue operating performance by firms located in emerging countries can be explained by a more aggressive use of accruals and a better timing of the IPO in order to coincide with a period of high operating performance.

Employing an extended data set from 1960 to 2013, we find evidence of synchronization across financial cycles. In case of business cycles, we find contrasting results: There is significant synchronization across growth cycles but no evidence of a common classical cycle. This confirms, first, that economic and financial variables in the Economic and Monetary Union behave differently and, second, that synchronization in business cycles arises from synchronized deviations from the trend, but the underlying macroeconomic fundamentals are not in synch. Furthermore, we adopt a novel approach to break down our full sample period into smaller subperiods to follow the evolution of synchronization over time. Our results highlight the role played by the monetary union in further increasing macroeconomic divergences.

Using an ARMAX(1,1) model in which the effect of the communication of negative macroeconomic news was disentangled from the commitment positive shock, the impact of the forward guidance on money market interest rates is estimated through the Euro Overnight Index Average swap, also called overnight index swap, at maturities between 2 months and 10 years using abnormal returns from an event study. The results and robustness checks suggest that the ECB's guidance lowered overnight index swap rates for maturities within 10 months to 3 years. These results imply the existence of a commitment effect from the ECB's communication.

Second, we distinguish between the euro effect on the extensive and the intensive margins of trade. Finally, we estimate the impact of the Euro adoption controlling for exchange rate volatility, exchange rate movements and EU membership. This allows us to disentangle the effect of a common currency beyond the elimination of trade barriers and of any variation in the exchange rate. The main results indicate that the impact of the Euro on trade values (intensive margin) is around 9% for intermediates, 7% for final goods and it is negative for capital goods. Interestingly, the Euro effects on the extensive margin of trade are found to be negative and significant for the three types of goods, pointing to increasing specialization.

We use the classification and regression tree methodology and its random forest extension, which permits the detection of key variables driving binary crisis outcomes, allows for interactions among key variables and determines critical tipping points. We distinguish between basic country conditions, country structural characteristics and international developments. We find that crises are more varied than they are similar. For banking crises, we find that low net interest rate spreads in the banking sector and a shallow, or inverted, yield curve is their most important forerunners in the short term. In the longer term, it is high house price inflation. For currency crises, high domestic short-term rates coupled with overvalued exchange rates are the most powerful short-term predictors. We find that both country structural characteristics and international developments are relevant banking-crisis predictors. Currency crises, however, seem to be driven more by country idiosyncratic, short-term developments. We find that some variables, such as the domestic credit gap, provide important unconditional signals, but it is difficult to use them as conditional signals and, more importantly, to find relevant threshold values.

Real Effects of Inflation on External Debt in Developing Economies,2016,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991358628&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1553&partnerID=40&md5=c87e5b212081c3692f96a79449443ca5,"This paper uses an intertemporal optimizing model with country-specific risk premium to evaluate the real effects of inflation in a small open developing economy. In the model, a central bank targets inflation, and the consumer requires real balances in advance for consumption spending. We show that a positive inflation shock (either due to growth in money supply or depreciation of the domestic currency) yields a decrease in real output and consumption—as inflation creates a tax wedge in the intratemporal condition between consumption and leisure—leading to a decrease in the stock of real debt in domestic currency. Employing these theoretical predictions and using annual data from a set of six developing countries (Chile, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia and Thailand), we estimate a sign-restriction based structural vector autoregression model along with a panel vector autoregression model for robustness analysis. The empirical results support the trade-off of inflation with reference to the key real variables including the external debt position, which is a significant result given the ambiguity in the empirical literature as to whether governments can escape from debt crisis via higher inflation.

Furthermore, the analysis of individual cross-listings reveals that both an improvement of a country's state of economic development and a better regulatory environment significantly affect the allocation of trading. While an improvement in economic development increases both local and foreign liquidity, a strengthening of regulatory standards leads to a decrease in trading volumes at foreign exchanges. Finally, the liquidity share in the foreign listing is found to decrease over time, a trend that turns out to be driven by developing rather than by developed markets.

It also investigates how the difference between domestic and foreign creditor protections affects the foreign investment. The impact of domestic creditor protection on cross-border investment in bonds is twofold. A high level of domestic creditor protection increases international diversification. At the same time, an efficient protection of creditor rights at home reduces the sensitivity of foreign investment to foreign creditor protection. These results hold most strongly for investing countries with high levels of domestic creditor protection. In addition, this study shows that the difference between domestic and foreign creditor protections matters for investment decisions: if domestic creditor protection is more efficient than foreign creditor protection, the sensitivity of foreign investment to foreign (domestic) creditor protection decreases (increases).

Salary changes, on the other hand, are not affected by corporate governance which is in line with ‘optimal contracting’. We also find that good governance is associated with more accretive deals for the bidder. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion that, unlike salary and long-term compensation, bonus compensation is not aligned with value creation and is more vulnerable to CEO manipulation in banks with poor corporate governance.

Against this background, economists endeavor to introduce financial factors into macroeconomic models. In this paper, we incorporate financial cycle into a four-equation model to study the linkages and interactions between financial cycle, business cycle and monetary policy. The results suggest that financial cycle plays a significant role in the business cycle, and that financial cycle shock has become a main driving force for macroeconomic fluctuations, especially during times of financial instability. In addition, by comparing the performance of the finance-augmented Taylor rule with that of the conventional Taylor rule, we find that both the financial system and the real economy will be better stabilized under the finance-augmented Taylor rule. This result adds new evidence to the argument that monetary policy has an important role in safeguarding the financial system and that financial stability should be adopted as a target for monetary policy.

Danger Zones for Banking Crises in Emerging Markets,2016,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963657346&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1550&partnerID=40&md5=25d31b39d04de5facbeb2f757ecca698,"This paper employs a recently developed statistical algorithm in order to build an early warning model for banking crises in emerging markets. The procedure creates many ‘artificial’ samples by iteratively perturbing the original data set and estimates many models from these samples. The final model is constructed by aggregation, so that, by construction, it is flexible enough to accommodate new data for out-of-sample prediction. Out of a large number (540) of candidate explanatory variables, ranging from macroeconomic variables to balance sheet indicators, our procedure selects a handful of indicators (and their combinations) that is sufficient to generate accurate out-of-sample predictions of banking crises. Using data covering emerging markets from 1980 to 2010, the model identifies two banking crisis' ‘danger-zones’, e.g. economic configurations that are conducive to crises. The first occurs when high interest rates on bank deposits, possibly reflecting liquidity risks and solvency fears, interact with credit-booms and capital flights; the second occurs when an investment boom is financed by a large rise in banks' net foreign exposure. We compare our model to models derived by standard econometric techniques, and find that our approach delivers much better out-of-sample predictions. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Benchmarking Judgmentally Adjusted Forecasts,2017,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84998890561&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1569&partnerID=40&md5=3f1ac6984356dccf61161f6edea1190b,"Many publicly available macroeconomic forecasts are judgmentally adjusted model-based forecasts. In practice, usually only a single final forecast is available, and not the underlying econometric model, nor are the size and reason for adjustment known. Hence, the relative weights given to the model forecasts and to the judgement are usually unknown to the analyst. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate the quality of such final forecasts, also to allow learning from past errors. To do so, the analyst needs benchmark forecasts. We propose two such benchmarks. The first is the simple no-change forecast, which is the bottom line forecast that an expert should be able to improve. The second benchmark is an estimated model-based forecast, which is found as the best forecast given the realizations and the final forecasts. We illustrate this methodology for two sets of GDP growth forecasts, one for the USA and one for the Netherlands. These applications tell us that adjustment appears most effective in periods of first recovery from a recession. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Welfare and Stochastic Dominance for the Measurement of Banks' Domestic Systemic Importance: Analytical Framework and Application,2016,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963677350&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1542&partnerID=40&md5=abeedfe0014e52c30162f2e2cfbb3dca,"This paper proposes an analytical framework to rank alternative measures of banks' systemic importance in terms of their welfare impact. The advantage of our approach is that it does not require knowing the exact mathematical form of the underlying welfare function in the absence of a widely accepted model of systemic risk. The framework consists of two pillars. First, economic welfare is linked to the measured degree of systemic importance of banks. Second, the association between the concepts of stochastic and welfare dominance of distributions of the measured degree of systemic importance is defined. Then, the alternative measures can be welfare-ranked by just establishing stochastic dominance relationships.

Different measures were calculated for assessing fiscal consolidations, based on the changes in the cyclically adjusted primary balance. A similar ad hoc approach was used to compute monetary episodes. Panel estimations for private consumption show that, in some cases, when fiscal consolidations are coupled with monetary expansions, the traditional Keynesian signals are reversed in the cases of general government final consumption expenditure, social transfers and taxes. Keynesian effects prevail when fiscal consolidations are not matched by monetary easing. Panel probit estimations suggest that longer consolidations contribute positively to its success, whilst the opposite is the case for revenue-based ones. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Confusion on this issue can encourage investors to follow strategies that involve insufficient diversification and excessive transactions costs. This paper identifies the misleading claims that are made for rebalanced strategies and demonstrates in theory and by simulation that the apparent advantages of rebalanced strategies over infinite horizons give an inaccurate impression of their performance over finite horizons.

The Return of the Monday Effect in European Currency Markets: An Empirical Analysis of the Impact of the Economic Crisis on Market Efficiency,2016,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84951299367&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1534&partnerID=40&md5=ee378d6e1c5f7cc61eccff1cded220b2,"This paper examines the relationship of multiple currencies, coupled with the Euro, to examine if there is evidence of the return of the Monday effect as a result of the recent global economic crisis. Each currency pair, which consists of the US dollar, Japanese yen, Great British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar, is compared with the Euro to find evidence to support the presence of the Monday effect. The currency pairs are tested in 1999–2004 as the first time period, again in 2005–2009 as the second time period, and then finally in 2010–2012 as the final time period, which represents the period impacted by the economic crisis. It is the authors' contention that the economic crisis that occurred after 2008 had a significant impact in the currency markets and that the Monday effect has become more pronounced because of a weakening of market efficiency. The results provide evidence that in the 2010–2012 period three currency pairs exhibit a statistically significant Monday effect. This Monday effect was not evident in either the 1999–2004 or the 2005–2009 periods, according to our analysis. This leads the authors to postulate that the economic crisis resulting from the mortgage meltdown has had a statistically verifiable effect on currency markets throughout the world.

Across major currencies, various terms to maturity, different data frequencies and the short as well as the long time horizon, single-equation regressions partly reject the UIP condition. However, this ‘UIP puzzle’ tends to disappear when panel data regressions account, for example, for risk premiums by means of two-way unobserved component specifications with random or fixed effects for both currencies and time periods. The closest concurrence with the UIP condition arises when specifying the time-specific component as fixed effect, which provides a way to address the potential bias when unobserved exchange rate risk premiums correlate with interest rates.

Current Account Reversals in Industrial Countries: Does the Exchange Rate Regime Matter?,2016,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84952332806&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1535&partnerID=40&md5=a361fa06cf0186b63a7d66c3dbc212c0,"This paper studies current account reversals in industrial countries across different exchange rate regimes. There are two major findings which have important implications for industrial economies with external imbalances: first, triggers of current account reversals differ between exchange rate regimes. While the current account deficit and the output gap are significant predictors of reversals across all regimes, reserve coverage, credit booms, openness to trade and the US short term interest rate determine the likelihood of reversals only under more rigid regimes. Conversely, the real exchange rate affects the probability of experiencing a reversal only under flexible arrangements. Second, current account reversals in advanced economies do not have an independent effect on growth. This result holds not only for industrial economies in general but also for countries with fixed exchange rate regimes in particular. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Current account; Exchange rate regime; F41; JEL F32; Reversals,United States; economics; exchange rate; finance; interest rate; trade flow

The empirical evidence based on them suggests the presence of unit roots in both the Standard and Poor's 500 Index and the Euro Stoxx 50 Index. Also, fractional cointegration appears to hold at least for the subsample from December 1996 to March 2009 ending when the global financial crisis was still severe; subsequently, the US and European stock markets diverged and followed different recovery paths, possibly as a result of various factors such as diverging growth and monetary policy. Establishing whether the degree of cointegration has changed over time is important because past literature has shown that diversification benefits arise when markets are not cointegrated. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Fractional cointegration; Fractional integration; Linkages; Stock markets,Europe; United States; cointegration analysis; economic growth; financial crisis; monetary policy; stock market

While leverage is oftentimes linked to the vulnerability of a nation, the stock of total debt and the flow of gross savings is a less explored measure. Cash flows certainly have a well-known connection to corporations' ability to service debt. This paper investigates whether the D/CF provides a means for understanding systemic risks. For a panel of 33 nations, we explore historic D/CF trends and apply the same procedure to economic sectors. In terms of an early-warning indicator, we show that the D/CF ratio provides a useful additional measure of vulnerability to systemic banking and sovereign crises, relative to more conventional indicators. As a conceptual framework, the assessment of financial stability is arranged for presentation within four vulnerability zones and exemplified with a number of illustrative case studies. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Debt to cash flow; Early-warning indicator; Financial crises; Four zone framework; Systemic risk; Total debt to gross savings,banking; capital flow; debt; financial crisis; lending behavior; savings

We use a novel micro-price dataset from Uruguay and focus on city borders. We find that, when the standard methodology is used, two supermarkets separated by 10km across two different cities have the same price dispersion as two supermarkets separated by 30km within the same city, implying that crossing a city border is equivalent to tripling the distance. By contrast, when upper quantiles are used the city border effect disappears. These findings imply that transport cost have been systematically underestimated by the previous literature.

Using logistic smooth transition models, we explore the existence of nonlinearity with respect to sovereign bond yield spreads (versus the German bund) as an indicator of confidence crisis/macroeconomic instability. Our results provide strong evidence that the extent of ERPT is higher in periods of macroeconomic distress, that is, when sovereign bond yield spreads exceed a given threshold. For almost all the GIIPS countries, we reveal that the increase in macroeconomic instability and the loss of confidence during the recent sovereign debt crisis have entailed higher sensitivity of import prices to exchange rate movements. For instance, the rate of pass-through in Greece is equal to 0.66% when the yield differential is below 2.13%, but beyond this threshold level, the sensitivity of import prices becomes higher and reaches full ERPT. Our findings raise the serious question of whether the exchange rate could be an effective tool to boost the trade balance and prevent deflationary threats when financial crisis hits. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Exchange rate pass-through; Import prices; Smooth transition models; Sovereign spreads,Germany; Greece; Ireland; Italy; Portugal; Spain; debt crisis; exchange rate; financial crisis; import; macroeconomics; nonlinearity; price dynamics; smoothing; sovereignty

Our empirical analysis of British Household Panel Survey data concludes that the bulk of risk sharing in the UK is driven by the savings channel. By allowing for risk aversion heterogeneity, we detect an inverted U-shaped relationship between risk aversion and the extent of smoothing achieved through financial markets. We also analyse the issue of risk sharing by income, education levels and region. We find that risk sharing is more effective (higher) for individuals whose savings are more flexible, while it is less effective (lower) for individuals characterized by more stable savings rate (like the Scottish population), regardless of their economic conditions. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Channels of risk sharing; Consumption smoothing; Income smoothing; Regional income differences; Risk aversion heterogeneity,United Kingdom; economic analysis; financial market; heterogeneity; household income; household survey; microeconomics; savings; smoothing
How Does Fiscal Policy Affect Investment?

CDS Spreads and Contagion Amongst Systemically Important Financial Institutions - A Spatial Econometric Approach,2015,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943452738&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1516&partnerID=40&md5=ebb03c138937e600e5557028c7416172,"This study applies a novel way of measuring, quantifying and modelling the contagion risk amongst financial institutions. The magnitude of risk spill over effects is gauged by introducing a specific weighting scheme to the regression. This approach originally stems from spatial econometrics. The methodology allows for a decomposition of the credit spread into a contagion risk premium, a systematic risk premium and an idiosyncratic risk premium. We identify considerable risk spill overs due to the interconnectedness of the financial institutes in the sample. In stress tests, up to one-fifth of the CDS spread changes are owing to financial contagion. These results also give an alternative explanation for the nonlinear relationship between a debtor's theoretical probability of default and the observed credit spreads - known as the 'credit spread puzzle'. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",CDS spread; CDS spreads; Financial contagion; Government policy and regulation; Spatial econometrics; Systemic risk,econometrics; economic analysis; financial system; policy making; regulatory framework; spatial analysis
"Time-varying Predictability for Stock Returns, Dividend Growth and Consumption Growth",2015,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943454189&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1522&partnerID=40&md5=42aea5ca17dc3ef2c61f0d4decc79016,"Using a state-space model, this paper examines time variation in the predictive regressions for stock returns, dividend growth and consumption growth. Moreover, we linked time variation explicitly to movements in economic factors that can account for risk and cash flow. Results support the view that stock return predictability is enhanced when risk is high (negative growth, higher volatility and positive growth/return covariance). In contrast, dividend growth and consumption growth predictability is enhanced during economic expansions. These results are supported by subsample analysis and a vector autoregressive approach. Furthermore, these latter exercises may uncover differences in the stock return predictability relationship when viewed over different time horizons. Overall, the paper contributes to the literature by highlighting the different nature of returns predictability, which arises largely through the risk channel, and dividend and consumption growth predictability, which arise through the cash flow channel. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Asset price movement; Consumption growth; Dividend growth; Predictability; State space; Stock returns; Time variation,consumption behavior; economic impact; numerical model; risk factor; stock market; vector autoregression
International Risk Sharing in the Short and in the long run under Country Heterogeneity,2015,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943454347&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1524&partnerID=40&md5=4618b7351a06150d628f8923496ec8be,"Empirical tests of international risk sharing usually focus on the short run and impose homogeneity across countries. We extend the existing literature by analysing both the short run and the long run aspects of risk sharing and by using novel econometric tools that properly account for heterogeneity across a large set of countries. The results confirm that international risk sharing is only partial and quite variable across economies. However, there appears to be no trade-off between the short run and long run: countries better insured in the long run also tend to perform better in the short run, with the strength of domestic credit markets being crucial in shaping this relationship. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Consumption insurance; Cross-sectional dependence; Heterogeneous effects; International risk sharing; Panel data,econometrics; financial market; heterogeneity; homogeneity; insurance system; model; panel data

The objective of this paper is to shed light on the downward trend in household savings in the USA starting in the mid-1990s. In addition to the theoretical determinants of household savings, the paper's innovation is in tracing the effect of the widely tracked consumer sentiment index on savings. Applying the dynamic autoregressive distributed lag model with bounds testing approach, the evidence confirms the relevance of the consumer sentiment index as an important factor that affects household savings, both in the short-run and long-run. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",ARDL; bounds testing approach; Consumers; sentiment index; Global imbalances; Household saving,United States; consumption behavior; financial system; household expenditure; household income; savings
A Quantitative Approach to Assessing Sovereign Default Risk in Resource-Rich Emerging Economies,2015,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84937252121&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1512&partnerID=40&md5=f300d55f97d4ccf7e58c6e170faf2a0a,"The problem of sovereign default is a tricky one for bankers, policy makers, politicians and investors alike. Purely financial models are likely to miss nuance and cultural idiosyncrasies. Nonetheless, risk metrics must play a role. Using a stochastic growth model in an open economy, we propose a Kealhofer, McQuown and Vasicek (KMV)-style approach for assessing sovereign default risk in resource-rich emerging economies. As is well known, financial effects, specifically external debt, can make a country vulnerable to economic shocks. Excessive external debt is, thus, a prime indicator for financial health in both resource-poor and resource-rich countries; yet, safe ratios are difficult to determine. Using a straightforward and easily implementable methodology, we show how optimal debt ratios may be used to define a 'distance from default' indicator variable. Further, we demonstrate that this is a plausible risk metric for a number of different developing countries, including representatives from Latin America, Africa and Asia. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Credit risk; Distance to default; External debt; Sovereign bond; Stochastic optimization,Africa; Asia; Latin America; credit provision; debt; developing world; numerical model; optimization; quantitative analysis; risk factor; stochasticity

We find significant unidirectional shock and volatility spillovers from the US market to both the Japanese and the Asian emerging markets. It is also found that the volatility spillovers between the US market and the Asian markets are stronger and bidirectional during the Asian financial crisis. Further, during the last 5years, the linkages between the Japanese market and the Asian emerging markets became more apparent.

Shock from graying: Is the demographic shift weakening monetary policy effectiveness,2015,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84926455895&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1505&partnerID=40&md5=c3a7909d841d1c9832bde13dd052154a,"There is mounting evidence that in advanced economies, changes in monetary policy have a more benign impact on the economy-given better anchored inflation expectations and inflation being less responsive to variation in unemployment-compared with the past. We examine another aspect that could explain this empirical finding, namely the demographic shift to an older society. The paper first clarifies potential transmission channels that could explain why monetary policy effectiveness may moderate in graying societies. Then, using Bayesian estimation techniques for the USA, Canada, Japan, the UK and Germany, a weakening of monetary policy effectiveness over time with regard to unemployment and inflation is confirmed. After proving the existence of a panel co-integration relationship between ageing and a weakening of monetary policy, the study uses dynamic panel ordinary least squares techniques to attribute this weakening of monetary policy effectiveness to demographic changes.

The data were first identified within the respective bull and bear phases following earlier results in the previous paper. Then, fractional integration and the asymmetric volatility model of Glosten, Jaganathan and Runkle were applied on the stock returns. Long-range dependence was detected in the squared stock returns at each market phase, and they were more persistent than those obtained in the monthly frequency data. The estimates of asymmetry of the Glosten, Jaganathan and Runkle model actually detected the different patterns of the bad news (bear phases) and the good news (bull phases). © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Bull and bear periods; Fractional integration; High frequency; Stock returns; Volatility,market system; modeling; stock market

Higher de facto monetary policy domestic activism seems to be correlated with lower real gross domestic product growth volatility and lower average consumer price index inflation from a cross-sectional perspective and lower levels of financial stress from a time-series perspective. Moreover, there is evidence that inefficient trilemma configurations-in which further improvements along more than one policy dimension should be simultaneously achievable-are more likely to be observed in less developed OECD economies with higher degrees of stress in their financial system. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Financial stress; Monetary independence; Monetary policy domestic activism; Taylor rules; Trilemma,central bank; financial system; Gross Domestic Product; inflation; monetary policy; OECD; price dynamics

Subsequently, cross-country correlations establish the relevance of fluctuations in imports to the pass-through channel of exchange rate fluctuations to economic activity. Further, the evidence evaluates the direct effects of fluctuations in the nominal values of imports on price inflation and real growth. Cross-country regressions evaluate the effects of variation in the average and variability of exchange rate fluctuations on import growth. Subsequently, variation in indicators of macroeconomic performance (real growth, price inflation and the growth of private consumption and investment) is evaluated with respect to variation in the exchange rate and/or import growth. In developing countries, the evidence indicates the relevance of fluctuations in import growth to the transmission mechanism of exchange rate fluctuations to the macroeconomy. Where this relationship dominates, fluctuations in the exchange rate are no longer significant to the difference in macroeconomic indicators, having controlled for variation in import growth across countries. In advanced countries, import fluctuations may be transmitted to economic activity, further to fluctuations in the exchange rate, in line with variations in terms of trade. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Developing countries; Exchange rate; Imports; Inflation; Pass-through,developing world; economic activity; economic growth; exchange rate; import; inflation; macroeconomics; price dynamics; trade

We estimate that a 10% variation in the real price of these five commodities moves the fundamental long-run real exchange rate by almost 5%. Changes in interest rate differentials do not explain short or long term movements in the exchange rate during this period. Furthermore, we find that deviations of the real effective exchange rate from the long run equilibrium level have an estimated half-life of approximately 8months.

The results of the time-varying analysis reaffirm the view that relationships between global financial markets tend to be quite volatile over time and particularly high in a time of high financial turbulence. Overall, the relatively weak interdependence between the US and the emerging markets' industry sectors suggests potential diversification benefits for investors in diversifying their portfolio investment across industrial sectors of emerging markets. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Causality; Cointegration; Emerging; Industry; Nonlinear,
The impact of fallen angels on investment grade corporate bonds portfolios: Evidence from the european market,2014,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939236360&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1496&partnerID=40&md5=f2f193846d2987bb8fcd9245e718679e,"This work examines the impact on the price of corporate bonds denominated in Euro of a downgrade to high yield announced by Standard & Poor's and/or Moody's Investors Service. In particular, we observe the bond price behaviour around three events. The first event is the first downgrade announcement from one of the rating agencies, and we find significant cumulative abnormal returns before and at around the event. The second event is the downgrade announcement by the second rating agency: in this case, the security becomes a fallen angel and must leave the institutional portfolios constrained to investment grade (IG) securities. We record again a significant negative price reaction but larger than in the previous case and significantly higher when preceded by a widening of the credit spread in the corporate bonds market. Broadening the existing literature, we perform a third event study, focused on the subsequent bond deletion from an IG benchmark. In this case, our results show positive and significant excess returns after the month-end index rebalancing, revealing a price reversal pattern of the fallen angel after its release from the index. This price rebound is the higher, whereas the stronger was the bond price pressure at the downgrade announcement. These insights offer some practical guideline for those professionals that manage IG and high-yield portfolios. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Bond rating downgrade; Fallen angel; Index rebalancing; Investment restrictions; Portfolio management,Europe; credit provision; investment; market system; price dynamics

Instead, order flows of financial and corporate customers reflect in real time the evolution of macroeconomies. The actions of the banks receiving the order flows in turn reveal the information to the market as a whole, which prices the exchange rate accordingly.

A panel-regressions investigation of exchange rate volatility,2014,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939258127&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1497&partnerID=40&md5=8fa51e7532d36dae92877a5dca2f0d30,"This paper offers an empirical explanation behind the dynamics of the overall volatility of exchange rates and its high-frequency, most economically destabilizing components. Spectral methodology is employed to isolate the portion of volatility attributable to high-frequency components, and panel regressions are used to relate the volatility measures to various macroeconomic and policy variables. Given the estimated panel regressions, the paper suggests policies that may help reduce exchange rate volatility in general and along high-frequency components in particular, thereby contributing to financial stability. The paper shows that while the macroeconomic and policy variables affecting the high-frequency components of volatility and overall volatility are generally similar, there are some important differences. The paper also highlights the divergent impacts of policy variables in developed vis-à-vis developing economies. The results are robust with respect to using alternative cut-off frequencies and estimation methods. The presented analysis may help to gain an understanding of the determinants of the most destabilizing components of exchange rate volatility and provide guidance into managing currency crises. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Exchange rate volatility; High-frequency components of volatility; Macroeconomic and policy variables; Panel estimation; Spectral analysis,currency; economic development; economic policy; exchange rate; macroeconomics; panel data; regression analysis; spectral analysis

Over this period, the positive signalling effects of bank dividends outperform the negative effect of dividends on default risk. During the pre-Prompt Corrective Action and the recent post-2007 periods, bank dividends do not affect GDP growth. This regime-dependent relation is due to an asymmetric role of bank default risk. These findings are of interest to bank regulators in reassessing the role of bank dividends within Basel III and carry important policy implications as bank dividends constitute an important tool available to policy makers for strengthening real activity. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Bank dividends; Default risk; PCA; Policy; Regime switching; Z-score,United States; banking; crisis management; economic activity; economic growth; economic impact; financial policy; Gross Domestic Product; mortgage lending; policy making; principal component analysis; risk assessment

In addition, European (North American) headquartered companies experience a statistically significant decrease (increase) in European sales after controlling for the additional control variables such as industry. Overall, we note that companies which have lower European sales and strategically move their sales out of Europe after crisis experienced an increase in ROA.

"Cross-border banking, externalities and sovereign distress: Does the euro need a common banking authority?",2014,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905019378&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1475&partnerID=40&md5=41d57092170866e6e787a82c5e2f82e3,"This paper analyses the role of linkages between cross-border banks and sovereigns in the spread of crises. After discussing evidence from past crises, I focus on the Euro Area. Banks from the Euro-core played a key role in shedding the seeds for the transition from the US mortgage crisis to the Euro Area crisis. While national authorities supported their damaged banks, the Euro-system's infrastructure allowed Euro-core banks to undo intra-area exposures with minor disruptions. Although this helped stabilize peripheral asset markets, the extent to which public funding replaced private one implied less macroeconomic correction and the current fiscal woes. The combination of cross-border banking and national resolution schemes creates an externality on sovereigns, who are forced to contain the effects stemming from the balance sheet management of cross-border banks. Weak public finances can easily push a banking crisis into a fiscal one. This negative externality is reinforced by Central Banks' mandate that limits fiscal cooperation. In the context of the Euro Area, to limit this problem, the Union should equip itself with a common bank resolution authority, which delinks banks and sovereigns. In addition, to limit the externality, macro-prudential policy could set contributions for cross-border operators in order to pre-fund future bank rescues. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Banking union; Cross-border banks; Externalities; Financial crises; Fiscal stress,Europe; United States; banking; central bank; European Monetary Union; financial crisis; financial market; sovereignty

Estimating liquidity risk using the exposure-based cash-flow-at-risk approach: An application to the uk banking sector,2014,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904961754&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1495&partnerID=40&md5=a67c77df24dee2a21f3c5487eaffa486,"This paper uses a relatively new quantitative model for estimating UK banks' liquidity risk. The model is called the exposure-based cash-flow-at-risk (CFaR) model, which not only measures a bank's liquidity risk tolerance but also helps to improve liquidity risk management through the provision of additional risk exposure information. Using data for the period 1997-2010, we provide evidence that there is variable funding pressure across the UK banking industry, which is forecasted to be slightly illiquid with a small amount of expected cash outflow (i.e. £0.06 billion) in 2011. In our sample of the six biggest UK banks, only the HSBC maintains positive CFaR with 95% confidence, which means that there is only a 5% chance that HSBC's cash flow will drop below £0.67 billion by the end of 2011. RBS is expected to face the largest liquidity risk with a 5% chance that the bank will face a cash outflow that year in excess of £40.29 billion. Our estimates also suggest Lloyds TSB's cash flow is the most volatile of the six biggest UK banks, because it has the biggest deviation between its downside cash flow (i.e. CFaR) and expected cash flow. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Exposure-based CFaR; Funding pressure; Liquidity risk; Risk management,United Kingdom; banking; capital flow; capital market; estimation method; forecasting method; risk assessment

To control for simultaneous changes in demand, we relate within-borrower changes in bank credit from multiple banks to banks' exposure to liquidity risk. To capture banks' vulnerability to the liquidity shocks that occurred during 2007-2008, we use measures of pre-crisis reliance on wholesale funding. Our results suggest that banks that were more exposed to liquidity risk during the crisis reduced syndicated lending more than other banks. Our results are robust to alternate measures of vulnerability to liquidity risk, choice of sample period and simultaneous movements in exchange rates. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Credit crunch; Liquidity risk; Syndicated loan market; Wholesale funding,

Indeed, when the Taylor rule includes contemporaneous data on the variables in the rule, the central bank can disregard from the exchange rate as long as there is enough with interest rate inertia in monetary policy. The reason is that interest rate inertia and a reaction to the current nominal exchange rate change are perfect substitutes in monetary policy. Hence, we give a rationale for the central bank to focus on the interest rate change rather than the interest rate level to have a desirable outcome in the economy, which we define as a determinate rational expectation equilibrium that is stable under least squares learning. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Determinacy; Foreign exchange; Interest rate inertia; Least squares learning; Monetary policy; Taylor rule,central bank; currency; economic theory; interest rate; least squares method; monetary policy; stock market

We find that this measure worked well in providing an advance signal of past UK episodes of banking system distress. But this does not guarantee future signalling success.

Self-fulfilling prophecies occur when countries become insolvent only because investors fear insolvency. They induce multiple equilibria, some of which correspond to bad equilibria and others to good equilibria. An important issue then is to solve this problem, notably to eliminate the bad equilibria. In the short-run, the role of the central bank as a lender of last resort is key. But this raises issues about the risk inherent to its intervention (inflation, solvency). In the medium run, macroeconomic policies in the euro are central (structural reforms and the reduction of external imbalances). In the long run, it may be worth proceeding to the consolidation of national budgets and debts, which would protect the countries of being forced with default by the financial markets. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Central banks; Eurozone; Self-fulfilling equilibria,

It brings together papers from academic institutions, international organizations and central banks. The first three papers argue that the crisis was triggered by the lack of confidence of the investors in the markets. This was reflected, for instance, in the pricing of the public debt (with an increase in the sovereign debt spreads) and in the reduced syndicated lending in wholesale lending markets. The other three papers focus on policy aspects by analyzing indicators that could serve as early warning signals of increasing stress and vulnerability. The authors propose three set of indicators: policy-based indicators, some variables used in the macro-prudential literature and financial indexes.

Using a stochastic frontier model, we find macroeconomic evidence of a strictly nonnegative error in an otherwise standard Phillips curve in post-war data on the US nonfinancial corporate sector. This error depends on growth in the profit ratio, output, and trend productivity, which should all determine the flexibility of wage adjustments. As the error usually surges during an economic downturn, the empirical model suggests that the downward pressure on inflation arising from higher unemployment in a standard Phillips curve framework is significantly cushioned. This might help to understand the robustness of inflation especially in the most recent past. In general, the cyclical dynamics of inflation appear to be more complex than captured by a conventional Phillips curve. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Inflation dynamics; Stochastic frontier model; Wage rigidities,United States; corporate strategy; economic theory; empirical analysis; inflation; macroeconomics; stochasticity; unemployment; wage

The ROC analysis is widely used in many fields, but in finance, the CAP analysis is more common. We compare the two methods, by using as an illustration the ability of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's country risk ratings to predict whether a country will have a programme with the International Monetary Fund (an indicator of financial distress). ROC and CAP analyses both have the advantage of generating measures of accuracy that are independent of the choice of diagnostic threshold, such as risk rating.

Financial markets and international risk sharing in emerging market economies,2013,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84881024544&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1463&partnerID=40&md5=0b2a1ea94d248ee9c01670efe5286b9e,"In light of rapidly increasing foreign equity liability positions of emerging market economies, we test for a necessary condition of international risk sharing, namely for systematic patterns between idiosyncratic output fluctuations and financial market developments. Panel analysis of 22 emerging market economies shows strong evidence for pro-cyclicality of capital gains on domestic stock markets both over short-term and medium-term horizons. This implies that domestic output fluctuations can be hedged through cross-border ownership of financial markets. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Capital gains; Cross-border investment; Emerging market economies; Financial globalization; International risk sharing,capital formation; financial market; globalization; market conditions; ownership; stock market

If financial integration makes financing external imbalances less costly, we expect slower external adjustment in more integrated economies. The study estimates theoretically founded trade balance reaction functions for a panel of 70 countries from 1970-2008. The empirical analysis finds that adjustment in integrated economies is slower. Consistent with the presented theory, the trade balance of integrated economies is more persistent, responds less strongly to net foreign assets and is more sensitive to fluctuations in net output. Under high integration, the response to the net external position is weak and close to the minimum required to ensure external sustainability. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Current account dynamics; External sustainability; Financial integration; Net foreign assets; Reaction function,economic instability; empirical analysis; financial market; sustainability
A Global model of international yield curves: No-arbitrage term structure approach,2013,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885935343&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1468&partnerID=40&md5=71a0bc631ec1100ddb8d66ec83c2888c,"This paper extends a popular no-arbitrage affine term structure model to jointly model bond markets and exchange rates across the UK, USA and euro area. Using a monthly data set of forward rates from 1992, we first demonstrate that two global factors account for a significant proportion in the variation of bond yields across countries. We also show that, for an explanation of country-specific movements in yield curves, local factors are required. Although we implement a very general factor structure, we find that our global factors are related to global inflation and global economic activity, whereas local factors are closely linked to monetary policy rates. In this respect, our results are similar to previous work. But an important advantage of our joint international model is that we are able to decompose interest rates into risk-free rates and risk premia. Additionally, we are able to study the implications for exchange rates. We show that whereas differences in risk-free rates matter, to a large extent, changes in the exchange rate are determined by time-varying exchange rate risk premia. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Estimation; Financial markets; Foreign exchange; Interest rates; Macroeconomy; Monetary policy; Term structure; Time-varying risk premia; Uncovered interest rate parity,United Kingdom; United States; economic activity; estimation method; exchange rate; financial market; global economy; inflation; interest rate; macroeconomics; monetary policy; risk assessment

The sample uses monthly data and covers the period from January 1988 to December 2010. Our causality-in-mean results indicate that there is feedback relationship between stock returns and business confidence in Portugal. The direction of causality-in-mean runs from business confidence to stock returns in Italy, but it is in the reverse direction in the case of Spain. Nevertheless, there is still evidence of a contemporaneous interaction between business confidence and stock returns in both Italy and Spain. On the other hand, causality-in-variance indicate the presence of volatility spillovers from business confidence to stock returns in Portugal, while a causal relationship is found in the current month in the case of Italy. Business confidence causes stock returns only in the mean in Greece.

However, current researches on PPP have mainly focused on the recent floating period and need various statistical models to carry out. We use quantile autoregression technique to comprehensively examine the mean reversion properties of the New Taiwan Dollar (NTD), where the NTD was both in a fixed regime period and a managed floating system period. Empirical findings indicate that NTD showed comparatively faster recovery when subjected to a larger or positive disturbance from the market. Additionally, when NTD was in a fixed regime period, PPP was mostly established. But during the managed floating system period, it was only partially established. These results suggest that mean reversion of real exchange rate heavily depends on the regime effect. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Fixed regime period; Managed floating system period; Mean reversion; Purchasing power parity; Quantile autoregression; Real exchange rate,Taiwan; currency; numerical model; purchasing power parity; real exchange rate; regression analysis

Simulation results show that aid tied to productive government spending delivers high growth rates and substantial welfare gains, without leading to a sustained real appreciation, only if the efficiency of public expenditure (a proxy for the quality of governance) is sufficiently high.

In addition, we look at the joint effects of CB autonomy and the legal tradition on the probability of a banking crisis in a country. Using the cross-country data for CB independence for the period of 1980-1989, and both binary and ordered logit estimation models, this study finds that a country's CB with more autonomy in aggregate can lessen the probability of a banking crisis. When the CB's autonomy is disentangled with respect to its responsibilities, this study finds that the longer the tenure of the CB's chief executive officer, the lower the probability of a banking crisis. We also find that the probability of a banking crisis in the country is reduced even more if the relatively more autonomous CB can perform its duties in line with the country's stronger law-and-order tradition.

We employ several panel unit root and panel cointegration tests as robustness measures to support our results. First, we propose a methodology to test for longrun money neutrality in a panel data context. Second, we test for longrun money neutrality by using our proposed methodology, and other popular panel cointegration tests in the literature. Moreover, and contrary to the main literature on money neutrality, we disaggregate output in its various components, and we test for money neutrality in each of them. The results show that, at aggregate level of output, money is neutral for both control groups although mixed evidence exists for the main group of the OECS. The disaggregated level that is employed in this paper allows us to uncover important differences that otherwise are not observable at aggregated level. We conclude that in terms of government expenditure, consumption and exports, there is strong evidence that in monetary unions such as the EMU and the OECS, those variables are neutral to money, contrary to other countries that do not belong to a monetary union. Therefore, we find a clear difference between those countries that belong to a monetary union or not. Our results support the existence of a central bank in monetary unions as being beneficial in order to allow that increase in money supply has no influence on real economic variables in the long run. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Cointegration; Long run; Monetary unions; Money neutrality; Unit roots,Caribbean Islands; central bank; cointegration analysis; economic analysis; European Monetary Union; expenditure; government; panel data; testing method

In theory, trade openness can affect inflation through changes in market competitiveness and productivity. Nonetheless, previous empirical studies often fail to account for productivity effects, and their results may overstate the role of market competition. This study shows that inflation decreases with greater market competitiveness even after controlling for productivity effects. Indeed, when market competition and productivity effects are both accounted for, trade openness becomes insignificant in explaining inflation. The results support that changes in market competitiveness and productivity are the main channels through which trade openness affects inflation. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Dynamic panel; Inflation; Market structure; Static panel; Trade openness,capital market; competition (economics); competitiveness; inflation; OECD; productivity; trade flow; trade performance

Examining realized volatility regimes under a threshold stochastic volatility model,2012,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866872014&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1458&partnerID=40&md5=683161afdcfe92373fca45d21605bbac,"This paper examines the realized volatility regimes under a threshold stochastic volatility (SV) model framework. Due to the availability of the volatility proxy, the estimation of the models' parameters can be easily implemented via standard maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) rather than using simulated Bayesian methods. In addition, the proposed model accommodates state-dependent correlations between the return and volatility processes. This new feature can not only explain the so-called leverage effect under the threshold SV framework, but also increase the flexibility of the model structure. Several mis-specification and sensitivity experiments are conducted using Monte Carlo methods. In the empirical study, we apply the threshold SV structure to three stock indices. The results show that in different regimes, the returns and volatilities exhibit asymmetric behavior. In addition, this paper allows the threshold in the model to be flexible (or data driven) and uses a sequential optimization based on MLE to search for the 'optimal'threshold value. We find that the model with a flexible threshold is always preferred to the traditional model with a fixed threshold according to the standard log-likelihood measure. Interestingly, the 'optimal' threshold is found to be stable across different sampling realized volatility measures. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",High-frequency data; Realized volatility; State-dependent leverage effect; Threshold stochastic volatility model,asymmetry; Bayesian analysis; maximum likelihood analysis; model test; model validation; Monte Carlo analysis; optimization; parameterization; stochasticity; threshold
Identifying contagion risk in the international banking system: An extreme value theory approach,2012,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866879723&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1459&partnerID=40&md5=697b42fdb0bfeb568031b8bc3d100699,"In this article, we use the extreme value theory framework to analyse contagion risk across the international banking system. We test for the likelihood that an extreme shock affecting a major, systemic global bank would also affect another large local or foreign counterpart, and vice versa. Our results reveal several key trends among major global banks: contagion risk among banks exhibits 'home bias', individual banks are affected differently by idiosyncratic shocks to their major counterparts and banks are affected differently by common shocks to the real economy or financial markets. In general, bank soundness seems more susceptible to common (macro and market) shocks when the global environment is turbulent; this may have important implications for global financial stability especially during stressful periods. Not surprisingly, our findings also suggest that bank contagion risk has risen over time, which emphasizes the need for continuing collaboration on cross-border supervision and crisis management. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Bank soundness; Co-exceedance; Contagion risk; Distance to default; Extreme value theory; Logit,banking; crisis management; economic impact; economic theory; financial market; financial system; identification method; risk assessment; theoretical study; trend analysis

The recursive estimated results show that after the structural change at the beginning of the sample period, the fractional differencing parameter d remains stable and generally larger than 1. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Fractional integration; PPP; Real exchange rate; Renminbi,China; United States; currency; economic integration; economic relations; hypothesis testing; purchasing power parity; real exchange rate; structural change; temporal variation
Purchasing power parity in nine transition countries: Panel surkss test,2013,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84873084461&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.457&partnerID=40&md5=fe55fb9c834a7d6f753aed5c7461fa53,"This study applies Panel Seemingly Unrelated Regressions Kapetanios et al. (SURKSS) tests, proposed by Wu and Lee (2009), to investigate the properties of long-run purchasing power parity (PPP) in nine transition countries over the period of January 1995 to December 2008. The empirical results from the univariate unit-root and panel-based unit-root tests indicate that PPP does not hold for these nine countries under study. However, Panel SURKSS tests indicate that PPP is valid for only two of these nine countries. As concerns major policy, our study implies that PPP can be used to determine the equilibrium exchange rate for both Estonia and Hungary, two countries under study. Our results emphasized that there is weak evidence about the long-run PPP hypothesis in transition countries, and the validity of PPP remains a controversial and unsettled issue. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Panel SURKSS test; Purchasing power parity; Transition countries,Estonia; Hungary; economic policy; exchange rate; hypothesis testing; market transition; purchasing power parity
Determinants of financial stress and recovery during the great recession,2012,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866851143&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.1457&partnerID=40&md5=510e47ca885f579f644a294128465921,"In this article, we explore the link between stress in the domestic financial sector and the capital flight faced by countries in the 2008-2009 global crisis. Both the timing of emergence of internal financial stress in developing economies and the size of the peak-trough declines in the stock price indices were comparable with that in high-income countries, indicating that there was no decoupling, even before Lehman Brothers' demise. Deleveraging of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) positions seemed to dominate the patterns of capital flows during the crisis. Although high-income countries on average saw net capital inflows and net portfolio inflows during the crisis quarters, compared with net outflows for developing economies, the indicators of banking sector stress were higher for high-income economies on average than those for developing economies. Internal and external distress during crisis was closely interlinked with common underlying causes of both the severity of stress during the crisis and the recovery. External vulnerabilities were important in both phases, and higher international reserves did not insulate countries from stress. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Capital flows; Decoupling; Determinants of financial crisis; Great recession,banking; capital flow; developing world; economic impact; financial crisis; financial system; OECD; stock market

Econometric analysis shows that (i) the predictive content of the term spread is not always significant over time and across countries; (ii) the spread significantly contributes to the forecast performance of simple growth regressions in Europe but not in the USA in recent years; and (iii) the variance of the random shocks to the term spreads tends to fall in all countries.

Major findings are as follows. First, invoicing in the importer's currency is prevalent in exports to advanced countries, because most of exports by the globally operating firms are destined for local retail subsidiaries of respective firms, which conforms to the pricing-to-market behaviour discussed in the literature. Second, Japanese firms that export highly differentiated products or have a dominant share in the global market tend to invoice their exporting products in the yen both to advanced countries and to developing countries. Third, although Japanese firms have shifted their production bases to Asian countries, exports from Japan to these Asian production subsidiaries tend to be invoiced in US dollars as long as the final destination market is in the USA. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Exchange rate pass-through; Intra-firm trade; Invoice currency; Japanese yen; Pricing to market (PTM),Japan; currency market; exchange rate; export; import; market conditions; trade flow; trade performance; trade relations

Several specifications of the return-generating process are applied as well as their corresponding conditional versions. Most European global socially responsible funds do not show significant performance differences in relation to both conventional and socially responsible benchmarks. US funds and Austrian funds show evidence of underperformance. By applying conditional models, we find evidence of time-varying betas but not of time-varying alphas. With respect to investment style, we find evidence that socially responsible funds are strongly exposed to small cap and growth stocks. Although these results are consistent with previous studies, they uncover some misclassification issues in these funds. Finally, we also document a significant home bias for global socially responsible funds. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Conditional models; Factor models; Fund performance evaluation; Global funds; Socially responsible mutual funds,Austria; United States; benchmarking; IMF; investment; performance assessment; stock market

This equilibrium is stable under least squares learning as well. Another finding is that inertia in monetary policy does not promote macroeconomic stability when technical analysis plays a major role in stock trading. Even worse, if the central bank in its policy only indirectly responds to stock price misalignments via its effect on the inflation rate, a combination of strong inertia in monetary policy and a significant role for technical analysis in stock trading will lead to macroeconomic instability. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Bubble policy; Fundamental analysis; Interest rate rule; Least squares learning; Macroeconomic stability; Stock price bubble; Taylor rule; Technical analysis,central bank; inflation; interest rate; Keynesian theory; least squares method; macroeconomics; monetary policy; policy making; policy strategy

We find that the unexpected component of order flow has a positive and long-lived effect on the official exchange rate in both stable and crisis periods, consistent with the basic microstructural approach. The price impact of unexpected order flow is related to the level of liquidity in the market. Expected order flow also impacts the exchange rate, suggesting inefficiencies in the market. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Exchange rates; Foreign exchange markets; Forex microstructure; Order flow,Ghana; capital flow; exchange rate; financial market; microeconomics; modeling

Our analysis adopts the variance sensitivity analysis (VSA) methodology due to Manganelli (2004) and we are able to recover from the univariate approach the multivariate dimension of the portfolio allocation problem. The main results of the analysis are: First, we demonstrate that using a two asset portfolio consisting of blue chips traded in the Greek capital market the estimated variance is a parabolic and convex function of the estimated weights providing evidence that diversification produces significant gains in terms of risk reduction. Second, based on the shape of the first and second derivatives the model misspecification due to the fitting univariate GARCH models is insignificant. Third, we compare the performance of VSA against that of three popular multivariate GARCH models and it is shown that the adopted methodology provides more efficient results than the competing models. The gains in efficiency get larger as the size of the portfolio increases. Finally, with the application of the Kupiec's test for out-of-sample forecasting performance we demonstrate that the VSA outperforms all three alternative models at both the 95% and 99% confidence interval independently of the trading position. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Asset allocation; GARCH models; Kupiec test; Risk management; Sensitivity analysis,capital market; confidence interval; exchange rate; multivariate analysis; numerical model; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; stock market

The analysis distinguishes between the period before and after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The findings indicate that comovement was driven largely by financial linkages. There is also evidence of 'demonstration effects' in the first stage of the crisis, as countries with vulnerable banking and corporate sectors exhibited higher comovement with the US market. Finally, despite a collapse in trade across countries, trade did not seem to play a role in explaining comovement in stock market returns. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Cross-market linkages; Financial crisis; Stock market comovement,United States; banking; crisis management; economic history; financial crisis; stock market

To give an account of these mechanisms, a BEKK model, in which we introduce a structural break, is adopted. Thus, this model explicitly tests the spillover effects of the liquidity risk premium on money markets. The results show that before the financial crisis (i.e. the reference period), there is a recursive propagation process between the Euro€ and the BP£ zones, a propagation process between the BP£ and the US$ areas and an obvious spread of volatilities from the EU€ zone towards the US$ zone. During the crisis period, the liquidity problems start from the US money market to the UK£ and EU€ money markets. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",BEKK model; Contagion; Financial crisis; Liquidity; Money markets,United Kingdom; United States; currency market; financial crisis; numerical model; spillover effect

The Mundell framework of optimum currency areas and a model on boom-bust cycles, by Schneider and Tornell, who take account of credit market imperfections prevalent in middle income countries. We highlight that the role of the exchange rate is strikingly different in the two models. Although in the Mundell framework, the exchange rate is expected to smooth the business cycle, the other model predicts that the exchange rate plays an amplifying role. We empirically evaluate both models for eight highly dollarized Central American economies. We document the existence of credit market imperfections and find that shocks from the exchange rate indeed amplify business cycles in these countries. Using a new method of Cubadda, we furthermore test for cyclical comovement and reject the hypothesis that the countries form an optimum currency area with the United States according to the Mundell definition. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Boom-bust cycles; Business cycle comovement; Central America; Credit market imperfections; Dollarization; Real exchange rate; Serial correlation common feature,Central America; business cycle; credit provision; currency; empirical analysis; real exchange rate

Developing powerful risk management tools becomes more than ever crucial to survive. Therefore this paper analyzes whether microfinance institutions can benefit from credit scoring, which has been successfully adopted in retail banking. An extensive literature overview is provided, indicating a lack of quantitative evidence, in particular for markets in Eastern Europe-Central Asia and the Middle East-Northern Africa. Two logistic regression-based scoring models are developed using data from a Bosnia-Herzegovinian microlender. The models are assessed in terms of stability, readability, and discriminatory power, indicating that credit scoring is not yet able to fully replace the human-intensive microfinance credit process. However, it is recommendable to introduce credit scoring as a refinement tool in the lending process, in order to combine both statistical and human best practices. Moreover, a microlender staff can learn from credit scoring models to validate or contrast practical intuition. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Bosnia-Herzegovina; Credit risk; Credit scoring; Logistic regression; Microfinance,Africa; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Central Asia; Eastern Europe; Middle East; banking; competition (economics); credit provision; financial crisis; financial market; lending behavior; microfinance; model validation; regression analysis

However, Eling (2008) compared the Sharpe ratio with some of these performance measures, and found virtually identical rank ordering using mutual fund data. This paper compares 13 performance measures with the traditional Sharpe Ratio using a sample of US Fixed-Income, Equity and Asset Allocation Mutual Funds. Results show that performance measures based on absolute reward-risk ratios have similar rankings, when the numerator (mean excess return) is the same. However, when we move to other types of performances measures, results may be significantly different. This is the case of the Manipulation-Proof Performance Measure (MPPM), Upside Potential Ratio, and Appraisal Ratio. Results are especially different for the MPPM. Robustness checks show that some of the performance measures are very sensitive to parameters' changes. Therefore, the choice of the performance measure is actually important for mutual fund ranking and selection. As a consequence, we argue that the use of several performance measures and rankings have a positive impact on the mutual fund's industry, reducing concentration. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Performance measure; Rank correlation; Sharpe ratio,correlation; income distribution; performance assessment; risk assessment

It finds significant parameter instability in a number of the export price equations, much of it consistent with a growing role of international factors in US export pricing. In the capital goods sector, the instability is traced to increases in the exchange rate responsiveness of export prices. The increase in the export price response of capital goods to the exchange rate is not unique to the US and may reflect intensified competition in the global market for machinery and transportation equipment. Even with these changes the exchange rate response of US export prices remains low, suggesting US exporters continue to pass through the bulk of exchange rate changes to the foreign-currency prices of their goods. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Exchange rate; Export prices; Pass-through; United States,competition (economics); exchange rate; export; globalization; price dynamics

Oil price changes are here associated with changes in stocks, bonds and effective USD exchange rate. The feedback trading mechanism is combined with an ICAPM scheme. This original model is estimated in a four asset CCC GARCH non-linear framework, where the risk premium and the feedback trading components of the conditional means are multiplicative functions of the system's conditional variances and covariances. The empirical analysis, which encompasses the 2008-2009 financial crisis, identifies a structural change in the year 2000. From then on oil returns tend to become more reactive to the remaining assets of the model and feedback trading more pervasive. A comparison is drawn between three and four asset minimum variance portfolios in the two subperiods, 1992-1999 and 2000-2009. Indeed, the trade-off between risk and returns-measured here by the average return per unit of risk index-indicates that in the last decade, oil diversifies away the empirical risk of our portfolio. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Feedback trading; Multivariate GARCH; Oil price dynamics; Portfolio allocation,commodity price; empirical analysis; exchange rate; financial crisis; oil supply; price dynamics; stock market; structural change

Estimating persistence in the volatility of asset returns with signal plus noise models,2012,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84855236826&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.441&partnerID=40&md5=ca1fc113a51cca374a364751cce36a46,"This paper examines the degree of persistence in the volatility of financial time series using a Long Memory Stochastic Volatility (LMSV) model. Specifically, it employs a Gaussian semiparametric (or local Whittle) estimator of the memory parameter, based on the frequency domain, proposed by Robinson (Annals of Statistics 23: 1630-1661), and shown by Arteche (Journal of Econometrics 119: 131-154) to be consistent and asymptotically normal in the context of signal plus noise models. Daily data on the NASDAQ index are analysed. The results suggest that volatility has a component of long-memory behaviour, the order of integration ranging between 0.3 and 0.5, the series being therefore stationary and mean-reverting. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Asset returns; Fractional integration; Long memory; Stochastic volatility,econometrics; economic integration; finance; numerical model; stochasticity
Funding liquidity risk and deviations from interest-rate parity during the financial crisis of 2007-2009,2011,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80052977451&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.427&partnerID=40&md5=d16bfa4780a84c1a52b34d3d314b1995,"Significant deviations from covered interest parity were observed during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. This paper finds that before the failure of Lehman Brothers market-wide funding liquidity risk was the main determinant of these deviations measured by swap-implied US dollar (USD) interest rates for the euro, British pound, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar and Swiss Franc relative to US Libor rates. This evidence suggests that the deviations can be explained by the existence and nature of liquidity constraints. After the Lehman default, both counterparty risk and funding liquidity risk in the European economies were the significant determinants of the positive deviations found for these currencies, while the tightened liquidity condition in the USD was the main driving factor of the negative deviations in the Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore markets. The negative deviations reflect the fact that these markets became alternative dollar funding sources as borrowing in the European economies became more difficult. Federal Reserve Swap lines with other central banks that eased the liquidity pressure reduced the positive deviations in the European economies. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Covered interest parity; Funding liquidity; FX swaps; Sub-prime crisis,China; Hong Kong; Japan; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; central bank; currency; economic history; financial crisis; financial market; interest rate; lending behavior; risk assessment
When markets fall down: Are emerging markets all the same?,2011,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80053023498&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.431&partnerID=40&md5=6c87eff5449231f092ba8edeeca48177,"This paper studies the dynamics of stock market regimes in emerging markets. Using a mixture version of the standard regime-switching model, we find that the 18 analysed emerging markets can be clustered into three groups. Whereas each of these three groups is characterized by the same two regimes-a bull state with positive returns and low volatility and a bear state with negative returns and high volatility-they clearly differ with respect to their regime-switching dynamics. The first group contains stock markets which swing frequently between the two regimes, the second group shows more regime persistence, and the third group consists of stock markets that are less likely than the others to move to a bear regime period. Standard practice among stock market analysts is to group emerging markets by geographical region. The fact that our model-based clustering is only weakly related to such a regional classification demonstrates the limited validity of the latter. Moreover, a detailed analysis of regime synchronicities across the 18 studied emerging markets shows that there is evidence of regime synchronicity for certain pairs of markets, but this does not rule out that two synchronized markets have different regime dynamics and thus belong to different regime-switching clusters. Hence, our results show that it is incorrect to treat the studied emerging markets as a single homogeneous group because there is strong evidence for substantial differences in their regime-switching dynamics. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Bear; Bull; Emerging markets; Heterogeneity; Switching-regime model,economic analysis; market transition; numerical model; regionalization; stock market

Modelling the bivariate dependence structure of exchange rates before and after the introduction of the Euro: A semi-parametric approach,2011,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80053045922&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.434&partnerID=40&md5=b5c4b7086bb82cb1757a656f8409aaee,"This paper investigates the bivariate dependence structure for three pairs of exchange rates measured against the US dollar: Euro and Japanese yen (JY), Euro and GBP, Euro and Swiss franc (CHF), in the pre-, post-Euro and the transition periods with the sample period ranging from January 1994 to November 2007. The Deutsche mark (DM) is used for the pre-Euro period. The novelty of the paper is that it employs non-parametric plots, which were derived based on the concept of copula, and a robust semi-parametric method to estimate copula models. The results indicate the changes in the dependence structure from the pre-Euro to the post-Euro period for the pairs DM (Euro)-JY, and DM (Euro)-GBP, with major changes occurring during the initial years of the launch of the Euro. For these two pairs of exchange rates, the model captures asymmetric tail dependence, implying different degrees of co-movements during appreciations and depreciations against the USD. The dependence between the Euro and the CHF remains unchanged, both in strength and structure, over the whole sample period, reflecting a marked tendency of the CHF to follow the fluctuations of the Euro against USD. There has been a tendency for the dependence between Euro and GBP to increase across the whole sample period.

Can a relative purchasing power parity-based model outperform a random walk in forecasting short-term exchange rates?,2011,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80052973817&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.435&partnerID=40&md5=b77253b47611cba1013b372d3673c48b,"This study uses a relative purchasing power parity (ppp) model-one that is an alternative to the 'real exchange rate'-to construct a time-varying equilibrium exchange rate of six US Dollar exchange rates. A linear forecasting technique is then used to determine the horizon over which a relative ppp-based model outperforms a random walk in forecasting exchange rates out-of-sample. The ppp models presented are based on CPI, PPI, and a proxy for traded goods price indexes. For all the currencies examined, the relative ppp-based model displays some sizeable forecasting improvements over a random walk. The ability of the relative ppp model (based on the proxy for traded goods price indexes) to outperform the random walk is most consistent in predicting changes in the US Dollar-British Pound exchange rate. Moreover, the best forecasting results vis-a-vis the random walk are obtained over the post-Plaza Accord period. For example, the ppp model statistically significantly outperforms the random walk for the British Pound (based on the proxy for traded goods price indexes) and the German Mark (based on CPI) over a 1-month forecasting horizon. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Forecasting; Foreign exchange rates; Random walk short-term horizons; Relative purchasing power parity,currency market; forecasting method; numerical model; price dynamics; purchasing power parity; random walk method; real exchange rate

Cross-dynamics of exchange rate expectations: A wavelet analysis,2011,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79957879504&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.423&partnerID=40&md5=6ad96b8e533b7ddb02493ef06b22a3b2,"This paper focuses on the cross-dynamics of exchange rate expectations over different time-scales. We use over-the-counter currency options on the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar to extract expected probability density functions of future exchange rates, and apply recent wavelet cross-correlation techniques to analyze linkages in these option-implied exchange rate expectations. The results show that market expectations are closely linked among the three major exchange rates. Regardless of time-scales, we find significant lead-lag relationships between the expected exchange rate probability densities. Nevertheless, our findings also indicate that the dynamic structure of exchange rate expectations may vary over different time-scales. In terms of short-run linkages in volatility expectations, the Japanese yen seems to have a leading role among the exchange rate triplet. At the longer scale, however, we also find significant feedback effects from the GBP/USD volatility expectations to the JPY/USD implied volatilities. The wavelet cross-correlations between the higher-order moments of option-implied exchange rate distributions indicate that the expectations about the JPY/USD rate are virtually unrelated to the developments of the European currencies, while the higher-order moments of the EUR/USD and GBP/USD densities appear strongly linked with each other. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Currency options; Exchange rate expectations; Wavelet cross-correlations,Japan; United Kingdom; United States; currency; exchange rate; financial market; probability density function; wavelet analysis

Common determinants of currency crises: The role of external balance sheet variables,2011,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959347438&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.425&partnerID=40&md5=7170d91f79293b6e4be2d81364f0215d,"This article investigates the role of external balance sheet variables as determinants of currency crises in emerging market (EME) and advanced economies. A random effect probit model is used in a panel of 40 countries with monthly data during the January 1980-December 2004 period. The main results of the article are as follows. First, size and, particularly, the composition of a country's external balance sheet are found to play an important role in the onset of crises. Second, EMEs seem to be more sensitive to external balance sheet variables than developed countries, and so too do economies with fixed or quasi-fixed exchange rate regimes. Third, international capital flows seem to have become a dominant force in explaining the onset of currency crises in EMEs. Fourth, further support is provided to standard theoretical explanations of currency crises. The likelihood of a crisis is found to increase with: the extent to which the real exchange rate rises above its trend; faster growth in broad money (relative to the level of international reserves); larger current account and budget balance deficits; lower GDP growth; and, if a neighbouring country already has a crisis. Economic fundamentals are also found to be a more important explanation of the onset of currency crises during the 1980s than during the 1990s, suggesting that more recent crises are less 'fundamentally' driven. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Currency crises; Early warning system; Emerging markets; External balance sheet variables; Leading indicators of currency crises,capital flow; currency; early warning system; exchange rate; financial crisis; Gross Domestic Product; modeling

These are domestic credit growth, net foreign borrowing, and currency crises: we find stronger linkages for the last two channels than the first.

What explains the spread between the Euro overnight rate and the ECB's policy rate?,2011,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959342930&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.430&partnerID=40&md5=380b51fbf1e590f88b146b28a1a8dcfd,"We employ a time series econometric framework to explore the structural determinants of the spread between the European Overnight Rate and the ECB's Policy Rate (Euro Over Night Index Average (EONIA) spread) aiming to explain the widening of the EONIA spread from mid-2004 to mid-2006. In particular, we estimate a model on the EONIA spread since the introduction of the new operational framework in March 2004 until August 2006. We show that the increase in the EONIA spread can for the largest part be explained by the current liquidity deficit. Moreover, tight liquidity conditions lead to a significant upward pressure on the spread. The ECB's liquidity policy only reduces the spread if a loose policy is conducted during the last week of a maintenance period. Interestingly, interest rate expectations have not been found to have an important influence. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Interest rate determination; Monetary policy implementation; Operational framework; Overnight market rate (EONIA),Europe; econometrics; financial market; interest rate; modeling; monetary policy; policy implementation
Can non-linear real shocks explain the persistence of PPP exchange rate disequilibria?,2011,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959340578&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.426&partnerID=40&md5=a6ae7ec3486c93b2cbc173125b7acf1a,"A core stylized fact of the empirical exchange rate literature is that half-life deviations of equilibrium real exchange rates from levels implied by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) are very persistent. Empirical efforts to explain this persistence typically proceed along two distinct paths, resorting either to the presence of real shocks such as productivity differentials that drive equilibrium exchange rates away from levels implied by PPP, or the presence of non-linearities in the adjustment process around PPP. By contrast, we combine these two explanations in the context of an innovative panel estimation methodology. We conclude that both explanations are relevant to the behavior of exchange rates and that resulting half-lives are much shorter than estimated using linear PPP and more consistent with the observed volatility of nominal and real exchange rates. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Balassa-Samuelson; EPSTAR; Exchange rate; PPP; Productivity,empirical analysis; estimation method; exchange rate; productivity; purchasing power parity

We extend the existing literature on foreign exchange market microstructure by considering a small open transition economy. We find that the intradaily exchange rate depends on both news announcements and order flow. We conclude that news on the HUF/EUR market are transmitted directly via immediate reactions to news announcements as well as indirectly via order flow. We decompose the total effect of news on exchange rate and find that order flow accounts for approximately three quarters, compared with one quarter for direct news impact. Although the HUF is pegged to the EUR, the exchange rate shows similar characteristics as reported in the literature for major currencies. It does, however, differ in quantitative terms: the importance of indirect news transmission is remarkably higher on the HUF/EUR market. Furthermore, we extend the commonly used set of news by communication of central bankers and significantly improve the explanatory power of the estimates. Thus, central bank communication can be regarded as an important determinant for the HUF/EUR rate.

We show by means of a bootstrap simulation experiment that the econometric rejections of UIP can be spurious and that an alternative methodology is needed to test for foreign exchange markets efficiency.

Our results are far more favourable than the existing literature to foreign exchange market efficiency.

The empirical results identify episodes of EMP in the Kyrgyz Republic and confirm the statistical superiority of the nonlinear regime-switching model over a linear VAR version in understanding EMP. The nonlinear empirical approach adequately characterizes the data generation process and yields results that are consistent with theoretical predictions, particularly the dampening effect of monetary contraction on depreciation pressure. During periods of appreciation pressure, however, the reverse policy option-monetary expansion-may not be efficient, particularly where PPP rather than UIP drives exchange rates. In addition, monetary expansion in such cases defeats the primary objective of monetary policy-price stability-and may exacerbate the instability.

Our investigation also proposes some normative recommendations, as we show: (i) that in extreme circumstances large-scale FX intervention can have destabilizing effects for the functioning of FX markets; and (ii) that the route chosen for the implementation of official intervention has important implications for its impact on exchange rates and on market conditions. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Exchange rate dynamics; Foreign exchange intervention; Foreign exchange micro structure; Order flow,economic impact; economic structure; exchange rate; market conditions; microstructure

A critical element in this study is the use of futures markets to isolate unexpected changes in the policy rate. We find a significant negative response of REIT returns to a surprise change in the policy rate. The paper then examines the potential sources behind such an observed response. We find important differences between the REIT market and the broader equity market. Adopting a variance decomposition approach we find that monetary policy surprises consistently have an impact on REIT returns and that the dividend channel is a driving force behind this influence. The results indicate the particular sensitivity of the general real estate market to Central Bank behaviour. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Federal funds futures; Monetary policy; Monetary policy surprises; Real estate investment trust; Variance decomposition,United States; capital flow; capital formation; central bank; decomposition analysis; investment; market conditions; monetary policy; policy analysis; property market
Evaluating growth volatility susceptibility within regional free trade agreements,2011,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650231191&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.411&partnerID=40&md5=e328c4e8c423da9983d72ca3d5dcd6cd,"It is believed by many that regional free trade agreements (RFTAs) are beneficial to a nation's economy. This paper compares the effects that trading partner volatility has on countries engaged and not engaged in RFTAs. What we find is that (1) whether a country is in an agreement or not, there is a statistically significant volatility spillover from trading partner economies, (2) being in an RFTA does not insulate oneself from non-RFTA volatility, and (3) participating in an RFTA actually increases susceptibility to volatility from other RFTA countries. We conclude that in terms of volatility susceptibility, it may be harmful for a country to enter into an RFTA. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Development; GMM; Trade agreements; Volatility,economic growth; free trade; spillover effect; trade agreement; trade relations
Sources of economic fluctuations in oil-exporting economies: Implications for choice of exchange rate regimes,2011,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650253835&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.409&partnerID=40&md5=594accdd2254d89c6af3ecbb312ae2c6,"If a country is dependent on one particular export commodity, what exchange rate policy should it follow? Surprisingly, there is no standard textbook prescription for such a country. In theory, rigidly pegging exchange rates to those of the developed economies allow emerging markets to fix the price of tradable goods and import monetary policy credibility leading to greater macroeconomic stability. The corollary being that countries lose their ability to react independently to domestic economic concerns. Nowhere are these macroeconomic policy dilemmas currently more acute than for emerging market oil-exporting economies, with their pegged exchange rates making it difficult to adjust to swings in the high price of crude oil. This paper investigates whether through rigidly fixing the exchange rate it is now the case that the disadvantages associated with importing a monetary policy ill-suited to the need of oil-exporting countries, now outweigh the gains from importing US monetary policy. The results in this paper show that pegged regimes are poor at insulating emerging market commodity-dependent economies from real shocks, in particular terms-of-trade disturbances. Allowing for caveats, the results show that greater macroeconomic stability could be fostered in emerging market oil-exporting economies by allowing for greater flexibility in their exchange rate regimes. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Crude oil; Domestic; Exchange rate regimes; External; Shocks,United States; crude oil; energy market; macroeconomics; monetary policy; oil trade; real exchange rate; terms of trade

For this purpose, we use the new panel data stationary test advocated by Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. that accounts for multiple structural breaks and cross-sectional dependence. Finally, our results give strong evidence for purchasing power parity when the Balassa-Samuelson version is considered.

Parametric and non-parametric approaches to exits from fixed exchange rate regimes,2010,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650464288&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.405&partnerID=40&md5=f02834db7e511708d5b34930812107df,"Following the demise of the Bretton-Woods, increasing number of countries has been opting for flexible exchange rate regimes. Exiting from fixed regimes however is not without costs. Regime transitions have often been occurred in the midst of a crisis, which has considerable economic costs in terms of output contraction and exchange rate depreciation. Given the big number of countries having still fixed regimes and financial markets that are fairly close and expected to be liberalized sooner or later, issue of exiting a peg without incurring crisis is a real challenge confronting these countries. The aim of this paper is to determine the conditions under which orderly exit is possible. The paper employs Binary Recursive Tree and standard regression frameworks. Analysis shows that countries with higher output gap and overvalued real exchange rate, among others, are doomed to exit in a disorderly way. Following their exit, output collapses and exchange rate depreciates considerably. The ill-managed financial liberalization and macroeconomic stabilization programs seem to lay the seeds of instability. An interesting finding is that the conventional strengths of parametric regression analysis can be dramatically improved by utilizing findings of non-parametric BRT technology.

Stock return predictability and dividend-price ratio: A nonlinear approach,2010,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650457665&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.401&partnerID=40&md5=ee50499d975c90d571cceb6ce056881c,"This paper examines the forecasting ability of the dividend-price ratio for international stock market returns. Hitherto, existing research has only considered this issue in sample and in a linear framework. Hence, this paper provides the first systematic study of non-linear forecasting within the present value model context. Using an asymmetric variant of the popular exponential smooth-transition (ESTR) model we demonstrate the superior forecasting ability for the G7 markets over both a linear and symmetric ESTR model on the basis of a variety of forecast performance tests. In particular, the asymmetric-ESTR model provides improved mean forecast error metrics that are largely significant on the basis of forecast equality tests. Furthermore, in a trading rule exercise this models provides superior trading returns. As a final exercise we compare the forecasting performance of the individual models with those obtained through forecast combination. These results support the individual models on the basis of forecast error tests but suggest the combination strategy may be more profitable. These results are of importance not only for model builders but also for market participants looking to undertake active investment strategies. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",ESTR model; Forecasting; Predictability; Stock returns,asymmetry; forecasting method; investment; modeling; prediction; profitability; stock market

A double transition correlation model with time and US stock price volatility indicates that correlations not only increase over time but also during periods of high volatility. The STCC models perform well in comparison with constant and dynamic conditional correlation models in terms of both statistical and economic criteria, but we demonstrate that an investor will gain little from portfolio diversification across these two important markets. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",DCC-GARCH model; Economic performance; International stock returns; Smooth transition conditional correlation GARCH model,United Kingdom; United States; correlation; economic conditions; financial market; financial system; globalization; market conditions; stock market
Forecasting financial volatility of the Athens stock exchange daily returns: An application of the asymmetric normal mixture GARCH model,2010,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650494024&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.407&partnerID=40&md5=7f28f2d9c3a83d739bab5fb0cafdcb8c,"In this paper we model the return volatility of stocks traded in the Athens Stock Exchange using alternative GARCH models. We employ daily data for the period January 1998 to November 2008 allowing us to capture possible positive and negative effects that may be due to either contagion or idiosyncratic sources. The econometric analysis is based on the estimation of a class of five GARCH models under alternative assumptions with respect to the error distribution. The main findings of our analysis are: first, based on a battery of diagnostic tests it is shown that the normal mixture asymmetric GARCH (NM-AGARCH) models perform better in modeling the volatility of stock returns. Second, it is shown that with the use of the Kupiec's tests for in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting performance the evidence is mixed as the choice of the appropriate volatility model depends on the trading position under consideration. Third, at the 99% confidence interval the NM-AGARCH model with skewed Student-distribution outperforms all other competing models both for in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting performance. This increase in predictive performance for higher confidence intervals of the NM-AGARCH model with skewed Student-distribution makes this specification consistent with the requirements of the Basel II agreement. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Asymmetric normal mixture GARCH; GARCH; Kupiec test; Risk management; Volatility,Athens [Attica]; Attica; Greece; confidence interval; econometrics; exchange rate; financial market; forecasting method; modeling; stock market

In addition, we compare the pricing errors of the different models using Hansen and Jagannathan's specification error measure. The main result is that for Denmark the Campbell-Cochrane model does not seem to perform markedly better than the CRRA model. For the long annual sample period covering more than 80 years there is absolutely no evidence of superior performance of the Campbell-Cochrane model. For the shorter and more recent quarterly data over a 20-30 year period, there is some evidence of counter-cyclical time-variation in the degree of risk-aversion, in accordance with the Campbell-Cochrane model, but the model does not produce lower pricing errors or more plausible parameter estimates than the CRRA model.

In order to study the finite properties of this approach, we generate trajectories in a stochastic volatility model. We find that the risk-neutral drifts and the yield curves are more accurately estimated. Finally, we show the supremacy of this approach by means of US Treasury Bill data.

As the latter largely refers to the period of inflation targeting in the UK, this finding uncovers the importance of monetary policy in insulating the real economy from unexpected financial market effects during periods of financial instability.

The effect of a transaction tax on exchange rate volatility,2010,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650431539&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.399&partnerID=40&md5=f3252ca016257ebaa82bea4d92a33184,"We argue that a transaction tax is likely to amplify, not dampen, volatility in foreign exchange markets. Our argument stems from the decentralized trading practice and the presumable discrepancy between 'informed' and 'uninformed' traders' valuations. Given that the informed valuations are likely to be less dispersed, a transaction tax penalizes informed trades disproportionately, leading to increased volatility. Empirical support for this prediction is found by investigating the effect of transaction costs on the volatility of DEM/USD and JPY/USD returns. High-frequency data are used and an increase in transaction costs is found to have a significant positive effect on volatility. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Exchange rates; Transaction tax; Volatility,empirical analysis; exchange rate; tax system; transaction cost; valuation

Is prior performance priced through closed-end fund discounts?,2010,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650493594&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.387&partnerID=40&md5=3e6f5da1abe0847ff90bd9c1304efde3,"In open-end mutual funds (unit trusts), there is a strong positive cross-sectional relationship between net inflows to individual funds and past performance, as if investors attributed performance to managerial skill. Performance shows only very weak persistence, however, so at first sight investors do not appear to gain anything by responding to past performance information. This behaviour can be explained by the fact that past performance is effectively unpriced in the unit trust market, since management fees are unresponsive to demand. If investors believe that there is a non-zero probability that future performance will turn out to be positively correlated with past performance (i.e. that there is an element of managerial skill in performance), but a zero probability that this correlation will be negative, it is rational to prefer funds with better past performance when performance is not priced. In other words, it costs nothing to insure against the possibility of some managerial skill effect.If this explanation of the flow-performance relationship in unit trusts is correct, one would expect the relationship between investor demand and past fund performance to be much weaker if past performance were to be priced. We test this hypothesis in the market for closed-end funds (investment trusts). Because closed-end funds do not trade at net asset value, but at a price determined in the market, strong demand will raise the ratio of price to net asset value (known as the premium). Since it is well established that premiums are mean-reverting, future shareholder returns on funds currently on high premiums tend to be depressed by the reversion of the premium to the mean. In the closed-end fund market, as for open-end funds, there is little evidence of performance persistence, and therefore, to the extent that funds with good past performance are pushed to higher premiums, the expected return on them is less than on the average fund. This implicit pricing mechanism should mean that demand is a declining function of the premium, so that, even if demand is an increasing function of past performance for a given premium, any effect on the premium itself will be muted.We test this hypothesis for closed-end funds traded in the US and the UK. We find that there is a statistically significant effect of past performance on the premium in both countries. However, consistent with the hypothesis, it has limited economic significance, since it represents only a small component of premium variability. © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Closed-end fund; Discount; Return,demand analysis; discount rate; investment; market system; price determination

Predicting nominal exchange rate movements using skewness information from options prices,2010,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77950845217&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.393&partnerID=40&md5=0cc4aa6f4ddc477daa3a727394e5bfe6,"This paper uses a measure of the relative price of out-of-the-money (OTM) European put and call currency options to forecast daily movements in the dollar/euro exchange rate over the period of January 2002-June 2004. As these OTM options are pure bets on future movements of the exchange rate, their relative price contains information about the market's estimate of the relative probabilities of appreciation or depreciation of the euro over the life of the options. Forecasts that include the relative price of the OTM options offer significantly better out-of-sample predictions of tomorrow's exchange rate than either the simple random walk or an interest rate parity model.

Using a largely unexploited data set, the paper finds that corporate bond spreads are determined by firm-specific variables, bond characteristics, macroeconomic conditions, country-specific sovereign risk, and global factors. A variance decomposition analysis shows that firm-level performance indicators account for the larger share of the variance. In addition, the paper finds that corporate spreads respond more acutely to sovereign and global risk increases rather than to decreases. This suggests two asymmetries prevalent in the data. The first is in line with the sovereign ceiling 'lite' hypothesis, which states that it appears from spreads data that sovereign risk remains a significant determinant of corporate risk although credit rating agencies have gradually moved away from a policy of never rating a corporate above the sovereign. The second is consistent with the popular notion that panics are common in emerging markets where investors are less informed and more prone to herding.

The incidence of both types of defaults is explained by means of the estimation of independent and simultaneous limited-dependent variable models.

The parity relationship between CDS premiums and bond yield spreads (BYS), that was tested and largely confirmed in the literature, is mostly rejected. Prices below par can result in positive basis, i.e. CDS premiums that are greater than BYS and vice versa. To adjust for the non-par price, we construct the BYS implied by the term structure of CDS premiums for various maturities. We are able to restore the parity relation and confirm the equivalence of credit risk pricing in the CDS and bond markets for many countries that have bonds with non-par prices and time varying credit quality. We detect non-parity even after the adjustment mainly in countries in Latin America, where the bases are larger than the bid-ask spreads in the market. We also find that the repo rates of bonds decrease around episodes of credit quality deterioration, which helps the basis remain positive.

The impact of noise trading is examined relative to price determination in FX futures, noise transmission from futures to options, and risk-management behaviour linking the two markets. The model simulations show noise trading in futures results in wider bid-ask spreads, increased price volatility, and greater variation in hedging costs. Above all, the Bayesian market maker manages price-risk by trend chasing not for speculative purposes, but to avoid being caught on the wrong side of the market. The pecuniary effects from this risk-management strategy suggest that noise trading tends to constrain the market maker's capacity to arbitrage; particularly when the underlying price is mean averting as opposed to a Martingale and trading sessions exhibit significant price volatility.

We find the higher the pricing-to-market at the intermediate good level, the lower the pass-through for the final good. The model is further extended to analyse three-country production sharing, substitution between two alternate sources of imported inputs. Finally, we draw some policy implications.

We find strong statistical evidence that this approach is preferred to the standard ADF for all countries considered. For 36 countries, there is strong evidence of regime-dependent stationarity, namely there is a regime in which the real exchange rate is stationary and another regime in which the real exchange rate is non-stationary. This suggests that over a sample period, there are sub-periods of stationarity and sub-periods of non-stationarity. We identify those sub-periods and assess their average duration and regime persistence. The results, robust to alternative sample periods, indicate that there exists sample-dependence in unit root results in previous studies, and help bridge the gap between conflicting results of these studies.

This finding is robust to various definitions of currency crises and exchange rates, across time, and across regions.

Measurement matters for modelling US import prices,2009,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-66049151268&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.370&partnerID=40&md5=22a897965e8b5485a09c30682136ccf9,"We focus on capturing the increasingly important role that emerging economies play in determining US import prices. Emerging-market producers differ from others in two respects: (1) their cost structure is well below that of developed-market producers, and (2) their wide profit margins induce pricing policies that seek to exhaust production capacity. We argue that these features have dampened the short-run responses of import prices to changes in the value of the dollar but that they have not altered the associated long-run response. To capture these considerations, we develop a new method to measure foreign prices and adopt a formulation that differentiates between short- and long-run responses. Our econometric work asks two questions: First, can one replicate the literature's dispersion of pass-through estimates? Second, is there any evidence of a change in the dynamic response of import prices to changes in the exchange value of the dollar? To address the first question, we estimate the parameters of our models using several alternative measures of US and foreign prices, dynamic specifications, and sample periods. We find that these alternative inputs translate into a large range of parameter estimates, a finding that helps to rationalizing the existing dispersion of estimates. To address the second question, we compute the implied dynamic adjustment of import prices to a change in the value of the dollar using parameters estimated from two samples: 1974-2000 and 1974-2005. The long-run response of import prices is similar regardless of which sample is used - roughly one-half of the change in the exchange rate is passed through to import prices. However, the short-run response is quite sensitive to the sample period. Specifically, the short-run response based on data through 2005 is smaller than the short-run response based on data through 2000. We argue that one force behind the change in dynamics of the import-price process is the greater presence of producers from emerging economies and that their effect on import prices can be captured with their measure of foreign prices.",Aggregation methods; Automated specification; Exchange rates; Pass-through; Penn World Tables; US import prices,North America; United States; commodity price; econometrics; estimation method; exchange rate; import; measurement method; modeling; parameterization; pricing policy; sensitivity analysis

The introduction of the euro greatly improved the functioning of euro financial markets. This paper investigates whether euro financial markets have developed sufficiently to facilitate the emergence of the euro as a reserve currency on par with the US dollar. We find that the liquidity and breadth of euro financial markets are fast approaching those of dollar markets, and as a result the euro is eroding some of the advantages that have historically supported the pre-eminence of the US dollar as a reserve currency. This strengthens the incentive for monetary authorities to reconsider the currency composition of their reserves. Nevertheless, the introduction of the euro has not yet resulted in a significant change in the currency composition of official reserve holdings. The US dollar has maintained its place as the dominant reserve currency, supported perhaps by the edge that dollar financial markets still have over euro markets in terms of size, credit quality, and liquidity, as well as inertia in the use of international currencies.

As a result, the model has jmax+1 rational expectations equilibria (REE), where jmax is large, since jmax past exchange rates affect the current rate due to technical analysis. There is, however, a unique REE that is economically relevant, and focusing on this REE, it is shown that the exchange rate is much more sensitive to a change in money supply than when technical analysis is absent in currency trade. This result is important since it sheds light on the so-called exchange rate disconnect puzzle in international finance.

We show that this method provides a useful new way of approaching the convergence debate. We apply this technique to a data set of monthly exchange rates of the 12 member countries of the European Monetary Union (EMU) over 1970-2001. Our empirical results neatly capture the convergence patterns related to the various regimes from Bretton Woods towards EMU.

We show that variability induces the firm to vertically segment markets (offer two varieties). This happens because variability in the exchange rate affects income dispersion and hence the firm's incentives to extract consumer surplus. To better extract surplus, the firm offers two price-quality menus, a high-quality variant geared for top-end surplus extraction and a low-quality variant to address market coverage concerns.

Interest rate transmission in the UK: A comparative analysis across financial firms and products,2009,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-66149116392&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.366&partnerID=40&md5=8d6f308eae58d9a2dc09033e6142db15,"This paper differentiates itself from the existing literature by testing for heterogeneities in the interest rate transmission mechanism using a large sample of 662 monthly retail rate histories (1993-2004) on seven key deposit and loan products. Error correction models are estimated to analyse the long-run pass-through, the long-run mark-up and the short-run speed of adjustment. The prediction that the official and retail rates move together in the long run is supported by the data. The evidence suggests weak between-product heterogeneity but notable differences were found between financial firms in the way they adjust their rates, which could hinder the achievement of monetary policy objectives. Consumer responses to official rate changes could therefore be more phased and intricate than hitherto believed. Heterogeneity in adjustment is found to be linked to menu costs and key financial ratios under managerial control.

Using short- and long-term interest rates we report evidence that a logistic smooth-transition error-correction model is able to best characterize the data and provide superior out-of-sample forecasts, especially for the short rate, over both linear and non-linear alternatives. This model suggests that market dynamics differ depending on whether the deviations from long-run equilibrium are above or below the threshold value.

Several studies indicate that the correlations between asset returns are time varying and using unconditional estimates of correlation in a portfolio optimization model can result in misallocation of assets. To overcome this problem we use multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models to estimate the time-varying correlations and use the same in portfolio optimization models. Ex-post return calculations show that unrestricted portfolios created with emerging stock indices and S&P 500 index outperform the S&P 500 index by itself. Since investors exhibit strong home bias in their portfolio choice, restricted optimization models are tested. Results indicate that if the total investment in emerging markets is restricted, a minimum investment of 20% in emerging markets is required to obtain significant diversification benefit. With investments in each of the emerging market restricted to less than 3%, there was no significant diversification benefit.

We compute model prices of at the money caps using only yield curve data, and we compare prices with those obtained when other well-known short-rate models are used, including the extended Vasicek model. With respect to natural benchmarks, we find a significant decrease in the pricing error for longer maturity caps when our model is used. These results witness that when a better specification of the dynamics of spot rate is provided, a satisfactory pricing of caps and floors is possible using only the information available in the bond market.

Using univariate and multivariate regressions, the results suggest that the level of the volatility of the overnight interest rate has significantly decreased after March 2004, whereas the sensitivity of the overnight interest rate has increased, especially over the last days of the reserve maintenance periods. Moreover, there is no evidence according to which the volatility of the overnight interest rate is transmitted to the volatility of money market interest rates at longer maturities.

What drives heterogeneity in foreign exchange rate expectations: Insights from a new survey,2008,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-66249086549&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.359&partnerID=40&md5=d38a17113d34e65641e5eb830ef97ad2,"Foreign exchange rate expectations play a central role in virtually all monetary models for the open economy. Therefore, it is extremely important to gain empirical insights into the expectations formation process. In this paper, we use a unique disaggregated data set to model the expectations of the Yen/USD exchange rate of about 50 leading foreign exchange rate professionals. The survey includes not only exchange rate projections but also expectations regarding macroeconomic fundamentals, like GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates. Different expectations of fundamentals can lead to different views of exchange rate dynamics. Using panel models, we are able to confirm the heterogeneity of exchange rate expectations often detected in previous studies. More important, we provide strong evidence regarding the likely source of heterogeneity. In line with forward looking models for the exchange rate, expected fundamentals have a substantial impact on exchange rate expectations, thereby challenging the backward looking evidence from previous studies. However, the heterogeneity in the expectations of macroeconomic fundamentals is not sufficient to explain the heterogeneity in exchange rate expectations.

The role of asymmetric information among investors in the foreign exchange market,2008,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-66249093809&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.367&partnerID=40&md5=80b0e337f06809335b3a1b884b5e699a,"This paper posits asymmetric information as the missing link between the currency demands of investors and changes in the exchange rate. A theoretical model demonstrates that changes in the exchange rate and currency demand are positively correlated for well-informed investors and negatively correlated for less well-informed investors, results consistent with stylized facts from the empirical literature. These theoretical findings are supported empirically using a new data set from the Israeli foreign exchange market. The empirical analysis indicates that a one million dollar larger purchase than sales by well-informed financial investors induces an increase of 0.060 per cent in the Israeli Sheqel/Dollar exchange rate over a one month period. A similar net flow from less well-informed investors results in a 0.046 per cent decrease in the exchange rate.

Research is mixed regarding what their effect has been on the system of exchange rate regimes and the anchor currencies at the centre of the system. The debate is complicated by growing empirical evidence that the dejure regimes announced by governments often differ from the de facto regimes that are actually applied. In this paper we divide the period 1990-2002 according to the major crises and use the generalized method of moments to identify the individual de facto regimes and relevant anchor currencies for each sub-period. We find that although intermediate regimes as a percentage of the overall database remained stable over the three periods, the type of peg and anchor currencies varied considerably. Pegs on a single currency fell from 62% of the sample in the first period to 49% in the second period, then rose to 66% in the third period. Basket pegs rose from 33% in the first period to 51% in the second period and back to 34% in the third period. Independent floats disappeared after the first period. When we group countries according to their access to capital markets, we find that all nine of the developed countries in the sample followed some type of intermediate regime for all three periods. We also find a trend towards hard pegs in the group of countries that has managed to increase its integration in the international capital markets. Our results also suggest that the US dollar remains the main anchor currency in the international financial system, even after the major currency crises and the rise of the euro.

But what is the impact of this policy on welfare? We answer this question using a microfounded, New Keynesian monetary model for a small open economy, to study the outcome of three alternative strategies for a central bank that targets both output and inflation: a policy of pure commitment; a discretionary policy where the exchange rate is free to fluctuate; and a strategy that pegs the nominal exchange rate. We first compare their impact on the policymaker's rule-of-thumb, quadratic objective and then on the agent's utility. In contrast to previous work, in which the policymaker maximizes a rule-of-thumb function, time-consistent monetary policy leads to a lower loss than a policy that ties the policymaker's hands by stabilizing the exchange rate. However, the strategy that fixes the exchange rate is ranked first when the policymaker maximizes the agent's utility.

Thus, purchasing power parity is probably violated, but real exchange rates have meaningful long-run equilibrium values.

We estimate the relationship between monetary policy and the exchange rate using a technique that explicitly recognizes the joint determination of both the levels and volatilities of these variables. We also consider more traditional estimation strategies as a test of the robustness of our main results. We introduce a new indicator of ECB communication policies that focuses on what the ECB says about the future economic outlook for the euro area along five different economic dimensions. The impact of the ECB communication policies is more apparent in the time-series framework than in the heteroskedasticity estimator approach. Time-series estimates reveal that interest rate changes generally have a much larger impact on exchange rate movements, and their volatility, than do ECB verbal pronouncements. Previous studies that conclude that news effects are significant at the daily frequency may have reached such a conclusion because the measurement of news was too highly aggregated. The endogeneity of the exchange rate-interest rate relationship is more apparent when the proxy for monetary policy is the euro area-US differential than when any other proxy for monetary policy is employed.

New estimates of exchange rate pass-through in Japanese exports,2008,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-42249102635&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.337&partnerID=40&md5=979596be3cb60897edbf325000ea4aee,"Recently, the issue of a decline in exchange rate pass-through has gained much more attention. Taylor conjectures that worldwide decline in exchange rate pass-through is related to the low and stable inflation in many industrialized countries since the early 1990s. Developments of 'new open-economy macroeconomics' also cast renewed attention on exchange rate pass-through. Theoretical research shows that the choice of an optimal exchange rate regime and the transmission of monetary policy impacts depend crucially on the exporter's price setting behaviour. There are many studies on the pass-through of Japanese exports, yet most studies simply use the industry-breakdown data on export price indices, which is insufficient to assess pass-through patterns in regional trade. Significantly, highly disaggregated (HS 9-digit level) commodity data are used here to evaluate the extent of pass-through by commodity and by destination. We investigate and compare the extent of pass-through to East Asia, Europe, and the US. We also examine whether there is any difference in the degree of pass-through in the pre- and post-Asian crisis era. Results suggest the most pricing-to-market (PTM) occurs in exports to the US market followed by significant, but less PTM in Europe. Virtually no PTM is found in Japanese exports to East Asia. Also, there is no clear evidence of either increasing or decreasing pass-through over time.

The results, subject to extensive sensitivity analysis, suggest that post-exits are better when depegging occurs in good macroeconomic conditions - an unnatural move for most policymakers - when world interest rates decline and in the presence of capital controls. Importantly, 'good' macroeconomic policies do not seem to help with post-exit performance.

Incomplete financial market and the sequence of international trade liberalization,2008,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38949137031&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.352&partnerID=40&md5=7caf60c0af5a1e39188e7bcaf15be53e,"In this paper, an incomplete financial market model was built to illustrate the impacts of the market incompleteness on the benefits of trade liberalization. Particularly, it will focus on the investigation of the impacts of different sequences of opening up the goods market. That is, should the government open up international trade simultaneously with the opening up of the domestic trade, i.e. implementing a 'shock therapy' approach? Or should the government liberalize the domestic goods market first, and then deregulate the international trade, i.e. following a 'gradualism' approach? This paper proves that the gradualism approach by opening up the domestic goods market before liberalization of the international trade can guarantee the successive improvement of everyone's welfare. Therefore, the gradualism approach is a Pareto-improvement sequence.

The term structure of credit spreads in project finance,2008,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38949167507&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.350&partnerID=40&md5=04a1a92e26b3ed93362a9b0272c46596,"This paper finds that the term structure of credit spreads in project finance is hump-shaped. This contrasts with other types of debt, where credit risk is shown instead to increase monotonically with maturity ceteris paribus. We emphasize a number of peculiar features of project finance structures that might underlie this finding, such as high leverage decreasing over time, long-term political risk guarantees and the sequential resolution of uncertainty along project advancement stages. Our result is particularly relevant given the importance of project finance as a source of long-term capital for infrastructure especially in developing countries and has implications for risk management in the framework of Basel II.

Does purchasing power parity hold in emerging markets? Evidence from a panel of black market exchange rates,2007,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-35348901968&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.318&partnerID=40&md5=503f3e1bb4564ad2295d04d73ea58ce7,"We examine the purchasing power parity (PPP) hypothesis using a unique panel of monthly data on black market exchange rates for 34 emerging market economies. We apply a large number of recent heterogeneous panel unit root and cointegration tests. Panel unit root tests reject mean reversion in black market real exchange rates for most (but not all) emerging market economies. On the other hand, all panel cointegration tests provide strong evidence of cointegration between the nominal black market exchange rate and domestic and foreign prices for both individual countries and the full panel. Since we believe that the findings from unit root tests may be affected by the imposition of the joint symmetry and proportionality restriction due to trade restrictions and measurement errors, we test for such a restriction using likelihood ratio tests and find that it is strongly rejected.

Term-structure estimation in markets with infrequent trading,2007,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-35348901969&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.317&partnerID=40&md5=c9984ab6e54ac2ea73e002dd055a0112,"There are two issues that are of central importance in term-structure analysis. One is the modelling and estimation of the current term structure of spot rates. The second is the modelling and estimation of the dynamics of the term structure. These two issues have been addressed independently in the literature. The methods that have been proposed assume a sufficiently complete price data set and are generally implemented separately. However, there are serious problems when these methods are applied to markets with sparse bond prices. We develop a method for jointly estimating the current term-structure and its dynamics for markets with infrequent trading. We propose solving both issues by using a dynamic term-structure model estimated from incomplete panel-data. To achieve this, we modify the standard Kalman filter approach to deal with the missing-observation problem. In this way, we can use historic price data in a dynamic model to estimate the current term structure. With this approach we are able to obtain an estimate of the current term structure even for days with an arbitrary low number of price observations. The proposed methodology can be applied to a broad class of continuous-time term-structure models with any number of stochastic factors. To show the implementation of the approach, we estimate a three-factor generalized-Vasicek model using Chilean government bond price data. The approach, however, may be used in any market with infrequent trading, a common characteristic of many emerging markets.

"Public debt indexation and denomination, the case of Brazil: A comment",2007,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-35348910159&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.334&partnerID=40&md5=452a6c9c0149b6c5db0f47fe3965373c,"In this work I analyse the model proposed by Goldfajn to study the choice of the denomination of the public debt. The main purpose of the analysis is to point out possible reasons why new empirical evidence provided by Bevilacqua et al., regarding a more recent time period, gives less empirical support to the model. I also provide a measure of the overestimation of welfare gains from hedging the debt caused by the simplified time frame of Goldfajn's model. Assuming a time-preference parameter of 0.9, for instance, consumption gains associated with a hedge to the debt that reduces by half a one-time 20%-of-GDP shock to government spending run around 1.43% under the no-tax-smoothing structure of the model. Under a Ramsey allocation, though, consumption increases by just 0.05%.

Does the Chinese interest rate follow the US interest rate?,2008,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38949173174&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.349&partnerID=40&md5=533a3a949756d250c9eb4ad42a717f95,"One argument for floating the Chinese renminbi (RMB) is to insulate China's monetary policy from the US effect. However, we note that both theoretical considerations and empirical results do not offer a definite answer on the link between exchange rate arrangement and policy dependence. We examine the empirical relevance of the argument by analysing the interactions between the Chinese and the US interest rates. Our empirical results, which appear robust to various assumptions of data persistence, suggest that the US effect on the Chinese interest rate is quite weak. Apparently, even with its de facto peg to the US dollar, China has alternative measures to retain its policy independence and de-link its interest rates from the US rate. In other words, the argument for a flexible RMB of insulate China's monetary policy from the US effect is not substantiated by the observed interest rate interactions.

The interest rate parity relation holds better at long horizons and the net exports variable does well in predicting exchange rates at short horizons in sample. In out-of-sample forecasts, we find evidence that our proxy for Gourinchas and Rey's measure of external imbalances outperforms a random walk at short horizons as do some of the other models, although no single model uniformly beats the random walk forecast.

Valuing foreign currency options with a mean-reverting process: A study of Hong Kong dollar,2008,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38949183637&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.346&partnerID=40&md5=8a2e75a8cf7a3afcd43bf715e5c26e94,"The theoretical prediction on targeted exchange rates expects mean reversion of the exchange rates. There is some empirical evidence to support this prediction. This paper presents a model for valuing European foreign exchange options in which the forward foreign exchange rate follows a mean-reverting lognormal process. The corresponding closed-form solutions for the option valuation are derived. The mean-reverting process has material impact on the foreign exchange rate option values and their hedge parameters. This tends to decrease the value of a simple put or call. On the other hand, the process also keeps the exchange rate in a small range around the mean level. As this is the region in which an option's intrinsic value is high because of the level of its strike price, there is also a tendency for option values to be enhanced compared with the values of the Black-Scholes model. The numerical results using the forward exchange rates of the Hong Kong dollar and market data of their options show that both of these effects are important for the realistic choices of parameter values. As the dynamics of targeted exchange rates may not follow the standard lognormal process as described by the Black-Scholes model, the mean-reverting option-pricing model may be considered for the valuation of options and estimation of associated hedge parameters on targeted exchange rates.

A typical NAC perceives an EU technology disturbance as a negative supply shock and an EU monetary expansion as a negative demand shock. When we split the seven countries into two groups, results for group 1 which includes the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia suggest that an EU supply shock feeds through as a demand shock, increasing both prices and output. This suggests trade acts as a channel of EU shock propagation. Monetary disturbances explain 2% and 3% of the output fluctuation of group one and two and 10% and 42% of interest rate variations, respectively. EU shocks are identified as given by Canova and De Nicoló (2002) using sign restrictions of the cross-correlation function of the variables' responses to orthogonal disturbances. These restrictions are derived from a DSGE model.

What determines transaction costs in foreign exchange markets?,2008,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38949133037&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.351&partnerID=40&md5=c7d4b0298fd96c859332cd090c67c230,"Using detailed data on the currency transactions of institutional fund managers, this paper shows that funds that experience high returns on their currency holdings also incur lower transaction costs on their currency trades. This finding holds both in the cross section, i.e. funds that perform better on average incur lower average transaction costs, as well as in time series, i.e. funds that do better over the past two months incur lower transaction costs on subsequent transactions. The results are consistent with foreign exchange dealers bidding for information from successful traders. They are also consistent with foreign exchange dealers exploiting price inelastic demand for foreign currency trades, or funds acting as secondary liquidity providers in foreign exchange markets.

A ratings-based approach to measuring sovereign risk,2008,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38949103349&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.357&partnerID=40&md5=3d4b4d67471bbbbdb02d7e1d25cf50f7,"We propose a new approach to measuring sovereign default risk.

We show that our measure is more informative for measuring sovereign risk. We re-examine the fundamental determinants of sovereign risk and find further evidence to support the debt intolerance and original sin explanations for country risk.

These models were used to identify the separate contributions to the probabilities of crisis of domestic and external variables. We found that, relative to domestic factors, adverse external shocks and large external imbalances contributed little to the average estimated probability of crisis in emerging market countries, but accounted for much more of the spikes in the probability of crisis estimated to occur during actual crisis years. We interpret these results to suggest that while, on average over time, domestic factors have tended to contribute to much of the underlying vulnerability of emerging market countries, adverse swings in external factors may have been important in pushing economies 'over the edge' and into currency crisis. In consequence, the costs of giving up exchange rate flexibility through adoption of strongly fixed exchange rate regimes - e.g. currency boards or dollarization - may be quite high for some countries.",Currency crises; Devaluations; Early warning systems; Financial crises,currency devaluation; early warning system; exchange rate; financial crisis; financial market

What if the UK or Sweden had joined the euro in 1999?

As an application we consider UK entry to the euro. Entry involves a long-term commitment to restrict UK nominal exchange rates and interest rates to be the same as those of the euro area. We derive conditional probability distributions for the difference between the future realizations of variables of interest (e.g. UK and euro area output and prices) subject to UK entry restrictions being fully met over a given period and the alternative realizations without the restrictions. The robustness of the results can be evaluated by also conditioning on variables deemed to be invariant to UK entry, such as oil or US equity prices. Economic interdependence means that such policy evaluation must take account of international linkages and common factors that drive fluctuations across economies. In this paper this is accomplished using the Global VAR recently developed by Dees et al. (J. Appl. Econometrics, 2007, forthcoming). The paper briefly describes the GVAR which has been estimated for 25 countries and the euro area over the period 1979-2003. It reports probability estimates that output will be higher and prices lower in the UK and the euro area as a result of entry. It examines the sensitivity of these results to a variety of assumptions about when and how the UK entered and the observed global shocks and compares them with the effects of Swedish entry.

Over the past 15 years, researchers have also attempted to determine if intervention has any effects on the dispersion and directionality of market views concerning the future exchange rate. These studies usually focus on the variance around the expected future exchange rate - the second moment. In this paper we demonstrate how to use over-the-counter option prices to recover the risk-neutral probability density function (PDF) for the future exchange rate. Using the yen/dollar exchange rate as an example, we calculate measures of dispersion and directionality, such as variance and skewness, from estimated PDFs to test whether intervention by the Japanese Ministry of Finance during the period 1996-2004 had any impact on the higher moments of the exchange rate. We find little or no systematic effect, consistent with the findings of the literature on the spot rate as: Japanese intervention was not publicly announced prior to August 2000, and since that time only publicly announced after the fact, over the past 10 years rarely coordinated across countries and, in hindsight, probably inconsistent with the underlying stance of monetary policy.

"Bulls, bears and excess volatility: Can currency intervention help?",2007,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34249010180&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.329&partnerID=40&md5=cb0cf2d92d127ef11285565bbb11b5ef,"Asset mis-pricing may reflect investor psychology; and excess volatility can arise from switches of sentiment. For a floating exchange rate where fundamentals follow a random walk, we show that excess volatility can be generated by the repeated entry and exit of currency 'bulls' and 'bears' with switches driven by 'draw-down' trading rules. We argue that non-sterilized intervention - in support of 'monitoring band' - can reduce excess volatility by coordinating beliefs in line with policy. Strategic complementarity in the foreign exchange market suggests that sterilized intervention may also play a coordinating role.

In line with recent evidence found for the US and Japan, the reaction of the Eonia to the term spread is non-symmetric. Moreover, the response of the Eonia to the policy rate depends on both, the repo auction format and the position of the Eonia in the ECB's interest rate corridor.

We also investigate the pattern of regional trade integration over time. The results suggest increasing intra-regional trade integration, particularly regarding Japanese trade integration with the region. They also indicate the decreasing influence of the US dollar in terms of magnitude, the German mark in terms of scope and the UK pound in terms of both magnitude and scope with respect to exchange rate determination in the region.

Our empirical results show that daily highs and lows of three main US stock price indexes are cointegrated. Data on openings, closings, and trading volume are found to offer incremental explanatory power for variations in highs and lows within the VECM framework. With all these variables, the augmented VECM models explain 40-50% of variations in daily highs and lows. The generalized impulse response analysis shows that the responses of daily highs and daily lows to the shocks depend on whether data on openings, closings, and trading volume are included in the analysis.

The empirical analysis shows that for the high-inflation countries the relationship between news in the fundamentals and the exchange rate changes is stable and significant. This is not the case, however, for the low-inflation countries, where frequent regime switches occur. We develop a non-linear model based on the existence of transactions costs that could explain our empirical findings. We find that this simple non-linear model is capable of replicating the empirical evidence uncovered in this paper.

We confirm informational and behavioural determinants of home bias and find them to hold simultaneously. Further examinations of potential characteristics of home biased fund managers show that the perceived informational advantage does not need to be valid. Multivariate analyses indicate home bias being related to relative return optimism, overconfidence, higher age, lower bonus and less experience. Therefore, behavioural determinants contribute usefully towards an explanation of the home bias puzzle.

In particular, they showed that the possibility that asset price disequilibrium would worsen, before being corrected, tends to limit rational speculators. Uniquely, SV showed that 'performance-based asset management' would tend to reduce risk-arbitrage when it is needed most, when asset prices are furthest from equilibrium. We analyse a generalized SV model for central bank intervention. We show that increasing availability of arbitrage capital has a pronounced effect on the dynamic intervention strategy of the central bank. Intervention is reduced during periods of moderate misalignment and amplified at times of extreme misalignment. This pattern is consistent with empirical observation.

For shorter time horizons, more weight is placed on technical analysis, while more weight is placed on fundamental analysis for longer horizons. The theoretical framework is the Dornbusch overshooting model, where moving averages is the technical trading technique used by the chartists. The perfect foresight path near long-run equilibrium is derived, and it is shown that the magnitude of exchange rate overshooting is larger than in the Dornbusch model. Specifically, the extent of overshooting depends inversely on the time horizon in currency trade. How changes in the model's structural parameters endogenously affect this time horizon and the magnitude of overshooting along the perfect foresight path are also derived.

Most coordinated operations explain, statistically, an increase in the persistent (continuous) part of exchange rate volatility. This correlation is even stronger on days with jumps.

In this paper we examine the effects of various types of intervention news on intra-day exchange rate behaviour. We find that unrequited interventions have a statistically significant influence on returns, volatility and order flow, suggesting that the expectation of intervention, even when governments do not intervene, can affect currency values.

In this paper, I show that a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model with sticky prices can account for these 'stylized facts' if we introduce international asymmetries in the price-setting behaviour of firms insofar as home (US) firms set export prices in their own currency only (producer-currency pricing), whereas producers in the rest of the world price their exports to the US in the local currency of the export market (local-currency pricing).

Our findings indicate that interventions usually take place during normal working hours while central banks show some preference for dealing with major domestic banks. Correction or prevention of long-term misalignments of exchange rates with their fundamental values and, to a lesser extent, the reduction of exchange rate volatility is the first motive given for intervention. The signalling effect of interventions is consistently put forward as the main channel through which interventions work.

We first model volatility regime switching within a univariate Markov switching framework. Modelling stock returns within this context can be motivated by the fact that the change in regime should be considered as a random event and not predictable. The results show that linearity is rejected in favour of an MS specification, which forms statistically an adequate representation of the data. Two regimes are implied by the model, the high-volatility regime and the low-volatility one, and they provide quite accurately the state of volatility associated with the presence of a rational bubble in the capital market of Cyprus. Another implication is that there is evidence of regime clustering. We then provide out-of-sample forecasts of the CSE daily returns by using two competing nonlinear models, the univariate Markov switching model and the Artificial Neural Network Model. The comparison of the out-of-sample forecast is done on the forecast accuracy, using the Diebold and Mariano test and forecast encompassing, using the Clements and Hendry test. The results suggest that both nonlinear models are equivalent in forecasting accuracy and forecasting encompassing, and therefore on forecasting performance.

The joint distribution of excess bond returns and fundamental macroeconomic factors is modelled on the basis of the consumption CAPM, using multivariate GARCH with conditional covariances in the mean to capture the term premia. We apply this methodology to the US economy and find it offers substantial evidence in support of the Fisher equation, greatly improving its goodness of fit at horizons of up to one year.

Moreover, we check the dynamic effect of rating changes on bond spread volatility. Finally, we test whether credit watchlistings influence credit spread volatility. We confirm prior studies in that, generally, credit ratings rank the risk of bonds according to credit spread volatility. We further find that rating changes have a dynamic influence on spread volatilities. Additionally it is shown that credit watchlistings significantly reduce the volatility. Thus, watchlistings are perceived to offer valuable information.

The paper extends recent research on the developmental effects of international financial integration, long-term trends in capital mobility and 'globalization in historical perspective'. Analysing the patterns of international financial integration in the three decades of the classical gold standard and after 1990 we show that investment in developing countries was a central element of 19th century financial globalization, but plays only a minor role today. The Lucas paradox of capital failing to flow from rich to poor has grown much stronger. In historical perspective, today's financial globalization is marked by massive diversification flows between high-income economies and a relative marginalization of less-developed economies.

Then we estimate links between both crises employing instrumental variables techniques.

Unlike previous work, which generally fails to find evidence of a long-run relationship employing linear models, we employ tests of the null hypothesis of no cointegration derived from nonlinear bivariate models that allow for threshold cointegration under the alternative hypothesis. For six of the countries in our sample our analysis reveals some evidence of a nonlinear long-run relationship between real exchange rates and real interest rate differentials. Asymmetric mean reversion of the equilibrium error is found to be driven by the asymmetric short-run adjustment of the real exchange rate to dis-equilibrium. When threshold cointegration is found to exist, we find stronger mean reversion when the equilibrium error is negative relative to when it is positive.

We discuss a state-space formulation by which prices can be decomposed into fundamental and non-fundamental components. The model is estimated on annual US data. The stochastic discount factor explains part of the volatility in equity values, but it is not sufficient per se to exclude the occurrence of near-exponential bubbles in the price-dividend ratio. These disappear if the dividend is replaced by a broader measure of the income flow generated by the firms.

Monetary policy and asset prices: To respond or not?,2006,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33748573966&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.298&partnerID=40&md5=8342dbfdf43ac414bfe0d3db16fa4d8f,"We investigate whether there is a case for asset prices in interest rates rules within a small econometric model of the Norwegian economy, modelling the interdependence of the real economy, credit and three classes of asset prices: housing prices, equity prices and the nominal exchange rate. We compare the performance of simple interest rate rules that allow for additional response to movements in asset prices to the performance of more standard monetary policy rules. We find that including housing and/or equity prices in the policy rules improve macroeconomic performance in terms of both nominal and real economic stability. In contrast, responding to exchange rate fluctuations seems less effective to this end, mainly because the instrument must be used quite actively, which contributes to higher volatility in general.

"An analysis of the distribution of extremes in indices of share returns in the US, UK and Japan from 1963 to 2000",2006,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33646767451&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.280&partnerID=40&md5=98d96a19467f43233175e09f5f33061d,"This paper seeks to characterize the distribution of extreme returns for US, UK and Japanese equity indices over the years 1963-2000. In particular, the suitability of the following distributions is investigated: Normal, Frechet, Gumbel, Weibull, Generalized Extreme Value (GEV), Generalized Pareto and Generalized Logistic (GL). Daily returns were obtained for each of the countries, and the minima over a variety of selection intervals were calculated. Plots of higher moment statistics for the minima on statistical distribution maps suggested that the best fitting distribution would be either the GEV or the GL. The results from fitting each of these distributions to extremes of a series of US, UK and Japanese share returns supported the preliminary evidence that the GL distribution best fitted the data in all three countries over the period of study. The GL distribution has fatter tails than the GEV distribution; hence this finding is of importance to investors who are concerned with assessing the risk of a portfolio. The paper highlights the important finance implicapons and in particular the potential for underestimation of risk if distributions without fat enough tails are employed.

Yet cyclical convergence is the key consideration for those countries that wish to be members of the currency union (e.g. UK). In general, countries will vary in the components and characteristics that make up their cycles at any moment, as well as in the state of their cycle at each moment. To take this into account, we show here how to decompose a business cycle in a time-frequency framework; so that its components vary in importance and cyclical characteristics over time. We show, the inconclusive convergence results obtained so far appear because countries have some cycles in common - but diverge at others.

Foreign exchange intervention and the Australian dollar: Has it mattered?,2006,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33646785366&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.299&partnerID=40&md5=049c6c97fd411a6af1ef4b346fca6170,"Since the Australian dollar was floated in December 1983, the Australian central bank (Reserve Bank of Australia) has actively intervened in the foreign exchange market. Using daily exchange rate and official intervention data from January 1984 to December 2001, this paper examines what effects, if any, foreign exchange operations by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) have had on the level and volatility of the Australian dollar exchange rate. First, using an event study we evaluate the effectiveness of intervention by examining its direct effect on the level of the exchange rate. We find that over the period 1997-2001, the RBA has had some success in its intervention operations, by moderating the depreciating tendency of the Australian dollar. Second, we investigate the effects of RBA intervention policies on exchange rate volatility over the floating rate period. Our results indicate that intervention operations tend to be associated with an increase in exchange rate volatility, which suggests that official intervention may have added to market uncertainty. Overall, the effects of RBA intervention are quite modest on both the level and the volatility of the Australian dollar exhange rate.

What sustains fiscal consolidations in emerging market countries?,2005,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-26944498986&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.274&partnerID=40&md5=f6c7feb8390f3ba3a526e5a358580b53,"This paper examines the factors affecting the persistence of fiscal consolidation in 25 emerging market countries during 1980-2001. It proposes a new approach for defining spells of fiscal consolidation. The results indicate that the probability of ending a fiscal adjustment is affected by the legacy of previous fiscal failures, the size of the deficit, the composition of spending and level of total revenues. There is also some evidence that the initial debt stock exchange rate developments, inflation and the unemployment rate have an impact on the persistence of adjustments.

Understanding order flow,2006,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33644801291&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.287&partnerID=40&md5=5531710043994f4eb237b80649fc8ae6,"This paper develops a model for understanding end-user order flow in the FX market. The model addresses several puzzling findings. First, the estimated price-impact of flow from different end-user segments is, dollar-for-dollar, quite different. Second, order flow from segments traditionally thought to be liquidity-motivated actually has power to forecast exchange rates. Third, about one-third of order flow's power to forecast exchange rates 1 month ahead comes from flow's ability to forecast future flow, whereas the remaining two-thirds applies to price components unrelated to future flow. We show that all of these features arise naturally from end-user heterogeneity, in a setting where order flow provides timely information to market-makers about the state of the macro-economy.

Macro lessons from microstructure,2006,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33644789011&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.288&partnerID=40&md5=7a460c86f84d0efa329c4100c7572125,"Empirical research on the microeconomics of currency markets, an area known sometimes as 'currency market microstructure,' has taken off in the past decade. This paper extracts from this research four lessons for modelling short-run exchange-rate dynamics. First, currency flows are a key determinant of exchange rates, and models should have these flows fully in focus. The appropriate equilibrium condition may be flow-currency supply equals flow-currency demand. Second, the flows of first-order relevance include those of 'financial' traders, who use currencies essentially as a store of value, and 'commercial' traders, who use currencies as a medium of exchange. Financial flows and commercial flows should be negatively related to each other, meaning that financial demand tends to be met by commercial supply. Also, financial flows should be positively related to exchange rates. Third, financial traders are motivated by profits, rather than consumption, and behave as if risk averse. Fourth, commercial traders are motivated by exchange-rate levels and rationally choose not to speculate. The workhorse models of international macroeconomics do not fit most of these lessons, and these important lacunae in their microfoundations may help explain their limited empirical success. The paper sketches an optimizing model of currency flows that is consistent with the lessons and has an encouraging empirical record.

The real exchange rate and real interest differentials: The role of nonlinearities,2005,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-26944475915&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.279&partnerID=40&md5=7e311c2374a7961a5ef1228997eab326,"Recent empirical work has shown the importance of nonlinear adjustment in the dynamics of real exchange rates and real interest differentials. This work suggests that the tenuous empirical linkage between the real exchange rate and the real interest differential might be strengthened by explicitly accounting for these nonlinearities. We pursue this strategy by pricing the real exchange rate by real interest parity. The resulting first-order stochastic difference equation gives the real exchange rate as the expected present value of future real interest differentials which we compute numerically for three candidate nonlinear processes. Regressions of the log real US dollar prices of the Canadian dollar, deutschemark, yen and pound on the fundamental values implied by these nonlinear models are used to evaluate the linkage. The evidence for linkage is stronger when these present values are computed over shorter horizons than for longer horizons.

Explaining trading volume in the Euro,2006,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33644800959&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.289&partnerID=40&md5=749e543ac8eed6e7d9352a725a730ae9,"Following the introduction of the euro in 1999, daily trade volume began a downward trend until early 2002, after which daily volume started to trend upward. A model of weekly trades suggests that changes in momentum as well as the carry trade motives of interest differentials are significant explanatory factors. Daily data examination reveals that Fridays have lower activity, and Tuesdays greater activity than average. At the intradaily level, trading is very low before and after London business hours. Within the London business day, trade activity is higher in 5-min intervals when a 'big figure' is breached. This is consistent with stop-loss or take-profit motives for trading.

Testing for financial contagion between developed and emerging markets during the 1997 East Asian crisis,2005,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-26944478538&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.284&partnerID=40&md5=7b1a2243714bc6a1a8bfd561a85d8907,"In this paper we examine whether during the 1997 East Asian crisis there was any contagion from the four largest economies in the region (Thailand, Indonesia, Korea and Malaysia) to a number of developed countries (Japan, UK, Germany and France). Following Forbes and Rigobon, we test for contagion as a significant positive shift in the correlation between asset returns, taking into account heteroscedasticity and endogeneity bias. Furthermore, we improve on earlier empirical studies by carrying out a full sample test of the stability of the system that relies on more plausible (over) identifying restrictions. The estimation results provide some evidence of contagion, in particular from Japan (the main international lender in the region), which drastically cut its credit lines to the other Asian countries in 1997.

We evaluate the performance of the C-CAPM by applying the nonparametric methodology of Hansen and Jagannathan and adopting five alternative specifications of utility. In addition to standard power utility we adopt the recursive preferences model proposed by Epstein and Zin. We also consider both internal and external habit formation (persistence) using the models proposed by Constantinides, Abel and Campbell and Cochrane. We evaluate our findings using the tests of Burnside and Hansen and Jagannathan. We find that the majority of models produce stochastic discount factors consistent with the data. However, high degrees of risk aversion are implied for the models to be consistent. Incorporating habit formation only partially reduces the implied levels of risk aversion.

When assessing how informative order flow is, the VAR methodology is typically employed, using impulse response functions. However, in such analyses, the direction of causality runs explicitly from order flow to asset return. If data are sampled at anything other than at the highest frequencies then any feedback trading may well appear contemporaneous; trading in period t depends on the asset return in that interval. The implications of contemporaneous feedback trading are examined in the spot USD/EUR currency market and we find that when data are sampled at the 1 and 5 minute frequencies, such trading strategies cause the price impact of order flow to be significantly larger than when feedback trading is ruled out.

The structural change occurring in the relationship between BINDEX and NINDEX is much earlier than the crisis of November 1997.

Evidence is found of high-volatility regime dependence between the two real interest rates. In addition, there is evidence of regime-dependent Granger causality: the US real interest rate Granger causes the UK only in the regime of high volatility.

The main result is that industries highly dependent on external financing do not experience higher growth in value added in countries with liberalized financial markets. Liberalization does, however, increase the growth rates of both output and firm creation among externally dependent industries - given that the countries have reached a relatively high level of financial development. These results are consistent both with increased competition and increased outsourcing. Some tentative evidence points towards the latter explanation.

The dynamics of OFCs' money and lending are shown to be interdependent. We then consider the evidence for interactions between OFCs and other sectors.

Credibility of monetary policy in four accession countries: A Markov regime-switching approach,2005,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-14344263528&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.260&partnerID=40&md5=548413d4c817f7bdbb0bbafaf2aca3d7,"The aim of this study is to estimate the credibility of monetary policy in four accession countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and the Slovak Republic), based on the Markov regime-switching (MRS) framework. We utilize the theoretical proposition that in the conduct of monetary policy, there is uncertainty in terms of the type of central bank. We measure this uncertainty as a deviation of monetary policy from a target level. We utilize for the target level the differential between the interest rates of the four individual accession countries and a 'synthetic' interest rate of 11 EMU member countries.

For both sets of links, there is evidence that ex post uncovered interest parity tends to hold over longer periods, and the magnitude of the parity deviations is shrinking over time. The deviations depend upon the extent of capital controls, and in certain cases, exchange rate volatility. However, while the money markets of China are increasingly linked to money markets in the rest of the world, our empirical results suggest that the banking sector-the main source of capital for Chinese firms-remains insulated.

The efficient resolution of capital account crises: How to avoid moral hazard,2005,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-22444441877&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.270&partnerID=40&md5=5ba7a122f9b5c55a1099accdd556a40b,"This paper presents a model of capital account crises and uses it to study resolution mechanisms for both liquidity and solvency crises. It shows that liquidity crises should be dealt with by a standstill combined with IMF lending into arrears, whereas solvency crises should be resolved by debt write-downs. Dealing with solvency crises by lending would require a subsidy and this creates moral hazard, such as incentives for excessive borrowing, for too little equity financing and for investment in projects that are inefficient. The analysis underlines the importance of accurately assessing whether a crisis is rooted in a liquidity or a solvency problem.

Using alternative nonlinear models, our results support mean reversion and asymmetric adjustment dynamics. We find differences in magnitudes, frequencies and durations of the deviations of exchange rates from fixed and time-varying thresholds, both between over-appreciations and over-depreciations and between developed and developing countries. In particular, the average cumulative sum of deviations during periods when exchange rates are below forecasts is twice that during periods of over-appreciation and larger for developing than advanced countries.

We exploit the data during a period believed to contain a high concentration of informed Japanese traders in order to test this hypothesis. Comparing the period of informed trader clustering to a similar period without the informed, we find that yen/dollar exchange rate quotes adjust to full-information levels three times faster when the informed are active than when they are not. These results are consistent with a view of the foreign exchange market where private information is at times quite important.

The results show that Korean industrial production does not respond significantly to the depreciation of the Japanese yen against the US dollar during the pre-crisis period, but that it declines substantially and significantly during the post-crisis period. The forecast error variance decomposition also confirms that the impact of yen/dollar exchange rate shocks in explaining Korean industrial production is negligible during the pre-crisis period, but substantial in the post-crisis period. These empirical results are interesting in that the free-floating exchange rate regime adopted in the post-crisis period may be inadequate to insulate the Korean economy from external shocks such as fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate.

The economic value of technical trading rules: A nonparametric utility-based approach,2005,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-14344259581&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.256&partnerID=40&md5=c067b076fd035ae93ac515ba5fed6c0b,"We adapt Brandt's (1999) nonparametric approach to determine the optimal portfolio choice of a risk averse foreign exchange investor who uses moving average trading signals as the information instrument for investment opportunities. Additionally, we assess the economic value of the estimated optimal trading rules based on the investor's preferences. The approach consists of a conditional generalized method of moments (GMM) applied to the conditional Euler optimality conditions. The method presents two main advantages: (i) it avoids ad hoc specifications of statistical models used to explain return predictability; and (ii) it implicitly incorporates all return moments in the investor's expected utility maximization problem. We apply the procedure to different moving average trading rules for the German mark-US dollar exchange rate for the period 1973-2001. We find that technical trading rules are partially recovered and that the estimated optimal trading rules represent a significant economic value for the investor.

"Indexing, cointegration and equity market regimes",2005,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-14544272627&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.261&partnerID=40&md5=5701ba3925752c608d7a92e399f46b91,"This paper examines, from a market efficiency perspective, the performance of a simple dynamic equity indexing strategy based on cointegration. A consistent 'abnormal' return in excess of the benchmark is demonstrated over different time horizons and in different real world and simulated stock markets. A measure of stock price dispersion is shown to be a leading indicator for the abnormal return and their relationship is modelled as a Markov switching process of two market regimes. We find that the entire abnormal return is associated with the high volatility regime as the indexing model implicitly adopts a strategic position that pays off during market crashes, whilst effectively tracking the benchmark in normal market circumstances. Therefore we find no evidence of market inefficiency. Nevertheless our results have implications for equity fund managers: we show how, without any stock selection, solely through a smart optimization that has an implicit element of market timing, the benchmark performance can be significantly enhanced.

How do UK-based foreign exchange dealers think their market operates?,2004,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-10844269775&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.252&partnerID=40&md5=cc7ee29429d0af6c6e58131b278a6c81,"This paper summarizes the results of a survey of UK-based foreign exchange dealers conducted in 1998. It addresses topics in three main areas: the microeconomic operation of the foreign exchange market; the beliefs of dealers regarding the importance, or otherwise, of observable macroeconomic fundamental factors in affecting exchange rates; microstructure factors in FX. We find that heterogeneity of traders' beliefs is evident from the results but that it is not possible to explain such disagreements in terms of institutional detail, rank or trading technique (e.g. technical analysts versus fundamentalists). As expected, non-observable fundamental factors are thought to dominate short horizon changes in exchange rates, but observable fundamentals are deemed important over much shorter horizons than the mainstream empirical literature would suggest. Finally, market 'norms' and behavioural phenomena are very strong in the FX market and appear to be key determinants of the bid-ask spread.

A model of inflation targeting in an open economy,2004,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-10844245683&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.243&partnerID=40&md5=11a829d5265e94869a5e739ec42d1cf1,"This paper develops a model of inflation targeting in a small open economy under floating exchange rates. The central bank follows a simple Taylor rule to achieve a target inflation rate, and the inflation process itself is determined by an expectations augmented Phillips curve mechanism. The behaviour of the exchange rate is governed by uncovered interest parity as a benchmark case, and both exchange rate expectations and inflationary expectations are assumed to be held with perfect foresight. Finally, the level of output in the economy varies gradually in response to excess demand in the goods sector. The paper analyses the effects of two shocks, a reduction in the central bank's target inflation rate and a sudden increase in aggregate demand. The effects of these shocks in a large country engaged in inflation targeting on the outside world follow from these results.

We develop a theoretical model that attributes the change in the rate of pass-through to increased emphasis on inflation stabilization by many central banks. This hypothesis is tested on 20 industrial countries between 1971 and 2003. We find widespread evidence of a robust and statistically significant link between estimated rates of pass-through and inflation variability. We also find evidence that observed monetary policy behaviour may be a factor in the declining rate of pass-through.,Exchange rate pass-through; Inflation targeting; Taylor rule,exchange rate; inflation; monetary policy; targeting

The performance of the two regimes is compared in the face of money demand, aggregate demand and aggregate supply shocks. It is shown that the ranking of the two regimes is extremely sensitive to the weighting of the objective function as between price and output stability, the type of shock impinging upon the economy, the values of structural parameters of the economy and institutional features such as the degree of wage indexation within the economy. The results obtained suggest that estimates of the income elasticity of money demand, the elasticity of aggregate demand to changes in both the real exchange rate and the real interest rate, and the degree of openness of the economy are likely to be important to policyrnakers when making the choice of exchange rate regime. Neither regime can be said to be dominant in all circumstances.

We argue that the normal evolution of the international monetary system involves the emergence of a periphery for which the development strategy is export-led growth supported by undervalued exchange rates, capital controls and official capital outflows in the form of accumulation of reserve asset claims on the centre country. The success of this strategy in fostering economic growth allows the periphery to graduate to the centre. Financial liberalization, in turn, requires floating exchange rates among the centre countries. But there is a line of countries waiting to follow the Europe of the 1950s/60s and Asia today, sufficient to keep the system intact for the foreseeable future.

Since the relationship should be statistically insignificant or very weak in an integrated economy, its strength can measure the extent of goods market integration. A sequence of cross-sectional estimations for a number of points in time provides the temporal pattern of integration, so enabling changes in integration to be traced. The basic equation may be augmented by additional variables representing potential culprits behind market segmentation so as to estimate their impeding impact to integration. This methodology is empirically verified by applying it to the Russian domestic market. It is found that integration of Russia's goods market tends to improve with time; a number of culprits behind market segmentation are identified.

"Foreign university graduates in the Greek labour market: Employment, salaries and overeducation",2004,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-2142813947&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.238&partnerID=40&md5=2202315b51442a8cbfa51e07efb9baca,"Greece is ranked among the first countries of the world in terms of student migration, while compared with other EU countries Greece has the highest number of students studying in other member states. Although the issue of migrating Greek students is constantly analysed in the newspapers, and often in relation to the educational policy adopted in Greece, most of the academic literature (Kanellopoulos and Psacharopoulos, 1997) is focused either on the cost side of this phenomenon in terms of expenditure and its implications for the balance of payments or on the loss of brains (Brain Drain) when the best students remain abroad. So far, to the best of our knowledge, no research effort has been devoted to examining how well these students perform in the Greek labour market when they return home after completion of their studies. More specifically, in this paper we examine the performance of foreign university graduates with respect to three aspects: (a) the length of time between the completion of their studies and employment; (b) the extent to which these graduates are employed in professions for which They studied; and (c) the extent to which they are overqualified in the performance of the job which they hold. Our findings suggest that (i) EU graduates are better placed in the Greek labour market, from an employability point of view, compared with graduates from all other countries and also get higher salaries compared with those who have been educated elsewhere, and particularly those educated in the Balkan countries; (ii) factors leading to higher returns after graduation are previous work experience, whether the graduate had worked systematically in the past and also if their qualification is at MSc/MA level or higher. Moreover, graduates perceiving that their qualifications are higher than their job requirements are getting higher returns; (iii) graduates with parents having a university qualification do not consider themselves as overqualified.

Our results show that international tax-adjusted real interest rates are typically very persistent, with the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the sum of the autoregressive coefficients very close to 0.90 for nearly every country. A highly persistent real interest rate has important theoretical implications.

Capital mobility and inflation persistence: Theory and evidence from Greece,2004,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-2142754090&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.236&partnerID=40&md5=6893f9fc3c3e70b4788f1321e210dfd2,"This paper examines the relationship between the openness of the capital account and inflation persistence. In the theoretical part we find that in a fixed (floating) exchange rate regime inflation persistence is negatively (positively) associated with the intensity of capital controls. In the empirical part of the paper we analyse the dynamics of the inflation rate in Greece by associating inflation persistence with the capital account openness and we find evidence in favour of a positive relationship.

Dollarization and economic performance: What do we really know?,2003,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0142040694&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.217&partnerID=40&md5=3914210555625dc304ca601b49acc996,"In this paper we analyse the macroeconomic record of dollarized economies. In particular, we investigate whether, as its supporters claim, dollarization is associated with lower inflation and faster growth. We analyse this issue by using a matching estimator technique developed in the training evaluation literature. Our findings suggest that inflation has been significantly lower in dollarized nations than in non-dollarized ones. We also find that dollarized nations have had a lower rate of economic growth than non-dollarized ones. Finally, we find that macroeconomic volatility is not significantly different across dollarized and non-dollarized economies. We conjecture that the lower rate of economic growth in dollarized countries is due, at least in part, to these countries' difficulties in accommodating external disturbances, such as major terms of trade and capital flows shocks.

This conflict between market efficiency and long-run PPP appears as something of a conundrum. We resolve this conundrum by relaxing the assumption of a constant real interest rate differential and analysing the vector equilibrium correction system linking prices and the exchange rate, and draw out the economic intuition of our result. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.",Purchasing power parity; Random walk; Real exchange rate; Real interest rate differential,global economy; interest rate; purchasing power parity; real exchange rate

The analytics provide well-defined predictions for the behaviour of exchange rates and relevant monetary variables under both regimes. This allows us to distinguish clearly one regime from another and empirically test whether or not a country that targets inflation also exhibits a fear of floating. We analyse the recent experience in Mexico where the authorities now claim to be following an inflation targeting regime. Mexico is also one of the countries claimed to exhibit a fear of floating. Using data from Banco de México, we first confirm that by standard measures Mexico exhibits fear of floating. Second, we show that Mexico is inflation targeting and discuss the relationship and test for a distinction between the two. Finally, we conclude by discussing our results and their implications for other emerging market inflation targeters. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.",,Mexico [North America]; North America; banking; currency market; financial market; inflation

According to the variance decompositions, I find that monetary shocks can explain nearly 50% of real exchange rate variance in the long-run sample periods. All the evidence suggests that monetary shocks are indeed more important in a larger sample set. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.",Monetary shocks; Real exchange rate,decomposition analysis; financial market; real exchange rate; vector autoregression

The federal design of a Central Bank in a monetary union: The case of the European system of Central Banks,2003,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0142040689&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.214&partnerID=40&md5=c14d6dc1e63888a15c3aa40519d799ec,"In this paper we analyse the ESCB as a federal central bank system. First, the degree of decentralization of the ESCB will be briefly compared with its predecessor, the Deutsche Bundesbank, and its counterweight in the US, the Federal Reserve System. Moreover, the development during the period 1990 99 of the total, economics and research staffing of the ECB and the national central banks in the EU will be investigated and also the staff ratios of the national central banks in 1999. Furthermore, the research activities of the central banks in the European Union over the period 1990-99 will be analysed both in terms of input (economics and research staff) and output (quality-weighted number of articles in scientific journals). The share of economics research staff in total staff of the national central banks varies between 0.02 and 0.17. The ECB has the highest ratio between economists and researchers and other staff. A ranking of research performance based on the quality-weighted number of scientific articles per economics and research employee reveals that the Bank of Finland has the best research performance of European central banks, followed by De Nederlandsche Bank, the Banco de Portugal and the Oesterreichische Nationalbank. There is only a weak relationship between the research performance and the share of research staff. The conclusion 'small is beautiful' also seems to hold for the economics and research departments of the European central banks.

The potential consequences of alternative exchange rate regimes: A study of three candidate regions,2003,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0142135956&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.212&partnerID=40&md5=b2af152ff5d28b30297963d9ccaea1ce,"This paper examines the macroeconomic consequences of selecting alternative exchange rate regimes of countries in three regions. In particular, it studies whether Austria, the Netherlands, Canada and New Zealand made the right monetary regime choices between 1970 and 2000. We focus on the role of asymmetric shocks as a core determinant for the evaluation of various monetary regimes by studying the impact of a hard peg, a full monetary union, or floating exchange rates (with or without intflation targeting) on selected macroeconomic variables. Estimates of structural VARs are used to ascertain if the countries under review meet the essential ingredients of an Optimum Currency Area (OCA) and thus are candidates for a monetary union. Counterfactual experiments help to study economic outcomes had these countries pursued alternative monetary strategies. We conclude that a floating regime with inflation targeting is best for Canada, a monetary union with Australia is the best course of action for New Zealand, and monetary union is the appropriate choice for the Netherlands while there are reasons to believe that Austria might have been better off with a floating regime, at least for a time. We also find that good monetary policy is not confined to any particular exchange rate regime and that political and institutional factors weigh heavily in this decision.

Capital account liberalization and growth: Was Mr. Mahathir right?,2003,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0041730215&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.208&partnerID=40&md5=c84426c56cda48c32b6773f63d1276fa,"Much ink has been spilled over the connections between capital account liberalization and growth. One reason that previous studies have been inconclusive, we show, is their failure to account for the impact of crises on growth and for the capacity of controls to limit those disruptive output effects. Accounting for these influences, it appears that controls influence macroeconomic performance through two channels, directly (what we think of as their positive impact on resource allocation and efficiency) and indirectly (by limiting the disruptive effects of crises at home and abroad). Because these influences work in opposite directions, it is not surprising that previous studies, in failing to distinguish between them, have been unable to agree whether the effect of controls tilts one way or the other. And because vulnerability to crises varies across countries and with the structure and performance of the international financial system, it is not surprising that the effects of capital account liberalization on growth are contingent and context specific. We document these patterns using two entirely different data sets: a panel of historical data for 21 countries covering the period 1880-1997, and a wider panel for the post-1971 period like that employed in other recent studies. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.",Capital flows; Crises; Growth; Liberalization,capital market; economic growth; financial crisis; liberalization

A multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (MGARCH) model is used to identify the source and magnitude of spillovers. The results generally indicate the presence of large and predominantly positive mean and volatility spillovers. Nevertheless, mean spillovers from the developed to the emerging markets are not homogeneous across the emerging markets, and own-volatility spillovers are generally higher than cross-volatility spillovers for all markets, but especially for the emerging markets. © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Emerging markets; Market integration; Spillover; Volatility,Asia; Eurasia; financial market; market conditions; multivariate analysis; spillover effect

In line with economic priors, we find some evidence that when prices are too high, they move back to equilibrium more slowly than when they are too low. This may reflect the fact that, in the short run, it is easier for countries to restrict the supply of coffee in order to raise prices, rather than increase supply in order to reduce them. Further, there is some evidence that adjustment is faster when deviations from the equilibrium level get larger. Our forecasting analysis suggests that asymmetric and polynomial error correction models offer weak evidence of improved forecasting performance relative to the random walk model. © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Asymmetric and polynomial error models; Coffee prices; Forecasting,coffee; commodity market; estimation method; forecasting method; price dynamics

It reviews the use of business cycle synchronization data and the data produced by SVAR analyses, which led to the 'core periphery' distinction. It also reviews extensions of the criteria that have been proposed or generated in this context: in particular, the proposition that the criteria may be 'endogenous'. It presents Taylor rule estimates to check for inhomogeneities in Euro Area performance. The paper concludes that OCA criteria provide a useful starting point for evaluating monetary union options.

The results indicate that there was a fundamental change in the distributions of all exchange rates after Germany's reunification and so the single normal distribution assumption is not appropriate. Although the presence of GARCH remained, all rates' conditional distributions resembled the uniform, in the first period, but they approximated the double exponential in the second. Further, during and after the pound's brief and the Iira's longer associations with the ERM their distributions were unchanged. Finally, two other notable results were the reduction in the degree of volatility persistence in all Deutschemark rates during the after-unification period, and the rates' strong mean-reverting tendencies. © 2002 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.",Distribution; Exchange rate; GARCH; Persistence; Unification; Volatility,Germany; currency market; exchange rate; territorial reunification

In this setting, rational forecast errors are possible, and a test of the uncovered parity hypothesis, based on the cross-equation restrictions on a Markov switching process, suggests that the parity relationship cannot be rejected for three European currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar. © 2002 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.",Markov process; Policy rule; Rational forecast errors; Switching regimes,currency market; exchange rate; forecasting method; monetary policy

This phenomenon has been attributed to the leverage effect for stock markets. For exchange rates, asymmetry has also been documented with no economic reason apparent. In this paper, a hypothesis is proposed and tested which attributes the presence of asymmetric responses in exchange rate volatility to the intervention activity of the central bank. Using daily intervention data for the Reserve Bank of Australia, empirical evidence is presented in support of this hypothesis which suggests that intervention may do more harm than good in volatile markets.

Our transaction data are unique since they help us to identify the exact lenders and borrowers, thus reducing the aggregation bias. This paper raises three hypotheses to test equilibrium credit rationing. First, we argue that the loan supply should bend backward to be consistent with equilibrium credit rationing. Second, credit rationing is expected to be more severe in bad years than in good years, suggesting stronger asymmetric information during turbulent days. Third, the asymmetric information is more severe for bad companies than for good companies.

Estimation and testing of ARFIMA models in the real exchange rate,2002,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036406572&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.192&partnerID=40&md5=5ebb55178e436ad5b2e3e4078ea21592,"The Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) hypothesis is one of the most important theoretical relationships in international economics. However, its empirical support remains controversial. We propose an alternative way of modelling the real exchange rate in five industrialized countries in relation to the US dollar, by means of fractionally integrated ARIMA models (i.e. ARFIMA). This approach allows us to capture the low-frequency dynamics relevant for examination of the long-run parity. A crucial fact when estimating with parametric approaches is that the model must be correctly specified, otherwise the estimates are likely to be inconsistent. In fact, misspecification of the short-run components of the series can invalidate the estimation of its long-run behaviour. We propose a model selection criterion based on LR tests on nested parametric hypotheses along with other several likelihood-based criteria. As a validation method of the specified model, we suggest the use of Robinson's (1994) tests. Our empirical results indicate that the PPP might hold as a long-run proposition. © 2002 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.",Fractional integration; Long memory; Purchasing power parity,estimation method; modeling; real exchange rate; testing method
An empirical analysis of nominal rigidities and exchange rate overshooting: An intertemporal approach,2003,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0037399084&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.201&partnerID=40&md5=1e4429f54ee330e4dd95da3af1396667,"This paper develops a system of equations from a model that combines an intertemporal approach with nominal rigidities, and empirically examines for five foreign currencies if exchange rates overshoot. Exchange rate overshooting is considered as a country's idiosyncrasy that depends on characteristics of the goods produced by the country. Empirical results show that exchange rates tend to overshoot in response to the US monetary shocks and undershoot in response to foreign monetary shocks. According to the underlying framework of consumption-based intertemporal optimization, the results imply that the consumption demand is elastic for foreign goods and inelastic for the US-produced goods.

"Monetary policy transparency, inflation and the sacrifice ratio",2002,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036078840&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.183&partnerID=40&md5=a04bb734ec77ae792853fc46425ac6cb,"We examine how inflation and the costs associated with disinflation episodes are related to monetary policy transparency. We develop a simple model that demonstrates how transparency may result in lower inflation. Our empirical results show that in general, transparency may be associated with lower inflation across a broad range of countries and frameworks. In addition, the output costs of disinflation, as measured by the sacrifice ratio, are negatively related to the degree of monetary policy transparency. The capacity of the central bank to limit the monetary financing of government deficits also has an inflation-reducing effect. Considering transparency as a possible determinant of cross-country differences in the costs of disinflation represents a new contribution to the literature, especially given the failure of previous empirical research to find a robust negative relationship between other aspects of the central bank's institutional design and the sacrifice ratio.

Do indicators of financial crises work? An evaluation of an early warning system,2003,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0037265313&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.197&partnerID=40&md5=a279429d0e60467f9761055b0a2687b0,"The object of this paper is to develop an operational early warning system (EWS) that can detect financial crises. To achieve this goal the paper analyses and extends the early warning system developed by Kaminsky, Lizondo and Reinhart (1998) and Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) that is based on the 'signal' approach. This system monitors several indicators that tend to exhibit an unusual behaviour in the periods preceding a crisis. When an indicator exceeds (or falls below) a threshold, then it is said to issue a 'signal' that a currency crisis may occur within a given period. The model does a fairly good job of anticipating some of the crises in 1997/1998, but several weaknesses to the approach are identified. The paper also evaluates how this system can be applied to an individual country. On balance, the results in this paper are mixed, but the results suggest that an early warning system should be thought of as a useful diagnostic tool. © 2002 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.",Asian crisis; Balance of payments crisis; Crisis prediction; Currency crises; Vulnerability indicators,detection method; early warning system; economic conditions; financial crisis
Financial market integration in Europe: On the effects of EMU on stock markets,2002,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036373039&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.187&partnerID=40&md5=28f771b42003b55ef39ccead3d286f13,"This paper analyses the integration process of European equity markets since the 1980s. Its central focus is on the role that EMU, and specifically, changes in exchange rate volatility, has played in this process of financial integration. Building on an uncovered interest rate parity condition to measure financial integration, a trivariate GARCH model with time-varying coefficients yields three key results: first, European equity markets have become highly integrated only since 1996. Second, the Euro area market has gained considerably in importance in world financial markets and has taken over from the USA as the dominant market in Europe. Third, the integration of European equity markets is in large part explained by the drive towards EMU, and in particular the elimination of exchange rate volatility and uncertainty in the process of monetary unification.

Exchange rate pass-through in a small open economy: Panel evidence from Hong Kong,2003,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0037398813&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.202&partnerID=40&md5=406d891bb4fb3e8d4a9f995e944f737f,"This paper presents estimates of exchange rate pass-through derived from a panel of very disaggregated import unit-values to Hong Kong. The estimation approach builds on that utilized by Knetter (1989, 1993) to study export pricing and pricing to market. The three-dimensional data set examined comprises Hong Kong's top eight floating exchange rate trading partners, and twenty-one of the top 5-digit SITC imports since 1992. Pass-through estimates for Hong Kong imply relatively faster import price adjustment than is typically found for larger, less open economies. These estimates are robust to a number of sensitivity tests. Finally these results confirm, from a different perspective, findings by Parsley (2001) that deviations from the law of one price play a relatively smaller role in real exchange rate movements for Hong Kong to be supplies than for other East Asian countries.

Devaluation expectations and the stock market: A new measure and application to Mexico 1994/95,2002,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036373426&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.186&partnerID=40&md5=036de68b55b4f42b5ab7e953aa3687b3,"This paper develops a market-based measure of devaluation expectations derived from the relative stock market performance of companies with different exposures of current and future profits to exchange-rate changes. The measure can be viewed as a complement to measures of devaluation expectations based on interest-rate-parity conditions, survey data or macroeconomic models. Some of the benefits of the measure are that data are available on a timely basis and that the stock market has traditionally been free of central bank intervention. As an illustration, we examine the Mexican devaluation of 1994. Contrary to what might have been expected given the alleged peso overvaluation, high-net-exporting firms outperformed the market beginning in late 1993. This pattern is, on the other hand, consistent with forward-looking stock prices that assigned an increasing probability to a devaluation benefiting exporting firms.

This view developed by industrial organization theorists is indifferent to the financing mode of a foreign acquisition as well as to the interaction between foreign direct investment (FDI) and real exchange rates. However, empirical research has uncovered a significant relationship between FDI and exchange rates. Second, partial equilibrium models of FDI have focused on FDI as foreign acquisitions of existing assets but not on new capital formation initiated by foreigners. We complement these contributions by developing a welfare-maximizing, general equilibrium model of the interaction between FDI as cross-border acquisitions, and the real exchange rate. © 2002 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.",Dynamic optimization; Foreign direct investment (FDI); Real exchange rates,exchange rate; foreign direct investment; general equilibrium analysis; optimization

We find that in the pre-crisis sample stock prices lead exchange rates negatively in Japan and South Korea (consistently with the portfolio approach) and positively in Indonesia and Thailand. In the latter two countries after the onset of the 1997 East Asian crisis the spillover effects are found to be bidirectional.

The methodological design is a multivariate vector moving average GARCH model which is suitable for examining the nature of the volatility spillover mechanism of long-term interest rates across markets. The empirical findings indicate that there have been stronger linkages among major bond markets since 1990 at the volatility level. The more synchronized behaviour of long-term interest rates across countries is evidenced by the speed and persistence with which disturbances in a particular market transmit to other markets. Such volatile behaviour affects the conduct of global monetary policy which now has to be done interactively among the world's major players.

On currency crises and contagion,2003,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0037399454&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.203&partnerID=40&md5=57cce531da8778f2ed32b2ee8df1fb16,"This paper analyses the role of contagion in the currency crises in emerging markets during the 1990s. It employs a nonlinear Markov-switching model to conduct a systematic comparison and evaluation of three distinct causes of currency crises: contagion, weak economic fundamentals, and sunspots, i.e. unobservable shifts in agents' beliefs. Testing this model empirically through Markov-switching and panel data models reveals that contagion, i.e. a high degree of real integration and financial interdependence among countries, is a core explanation for recent emerging market crises. The model has a remarkably good predictive power for the 1997-1998 Asian crisis. The findings suggest that in particular the degree of financial interdependence and also real integration among emerging markets are crucial not only in explaining past crises but also in predicting the transmission of future financial crises.

To this end, different rules are evaluated using alternative econometrics techniques. A comparative analysis is made of the ability of the rules to correspond to the historical central bank behaviour and of the volatility of output, inflation and interest rate changes that they imply. The study is conducted of the EMU countries. The results suggest that simple rules perform quite well and that the advantages obtained from adopting an optimal control-based rule are not so great. Moreover, the addition of a forward-looking dimension and of an interest rate smoothing term in the reaction function seems to improve the performance of the rules.

The results of cointegration analyses suggest that, despite the turbulent exchange rate movements during the crisis, the long-run purchasing power parity has remained to dictate the exchange rate and price relationship for all but Indonesia. The effects on the short-run dynamics are not unanimous, and there are indications of structural changes for selected countries, namely Korea and Thailand. Further, using impulse responses, we find that the speed of real exchange rate mean reversion is barely affected by the crisis, except for the Korean won. Overall, the empirical results suggest that the effects of the Asian crisis can generally be regarded as a temporary deviation rather than a fundamental shift in the real exchange rate behaviour.

This has prompted fears that a default or a compulsory lengthening scheme would be imposed. Here, we analyse the domestic public debt management experience in Brazil, searching for policy prescriptions for the next few years. After briefly reviewing the recent domestic public debt history, we decompose the large rise in federal bonded debt during 1995-2000, searching for its macroeconomic causes. The main culprits are the extremely high interest payments-which, until 1998, were caused by the weak fiscal stance and the quasi-fixed exchange-rate regime; and since 1999, by the impact of the currency depreciation on the dollar-indexed and the external debt-, and the accumulation of assets of doubtful value, much of which may have to be written off in the future. Simulation exercises of the net debt path for the near future underscore the importance of a tighter fiscal stance to prevent the debt-GDP ratio from growing further. Given the need to quickly lengthen the debt maturity, our main policy advice is to foster, and rely more on, inflation-linked bonds.

These components are then used as inputs into a regression analysis in order to explain the index returns of 13 ESMs over the period 1987-96. The analysis indicates that while world factors are significant in explaining ESM returns, local factors may also play a crucial role.

Human capital and financial development in economic growth: New evidence using the translog production function,2002,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036279119&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.182&partnerID=40&md5=786896b20e7c7bc11966f40738ab2ece,"In this paper we evaluate the contributions of human capital and financial development to economic growth in a panel of 82 countries covering 21 years. The main innovations in the paper stem from the fact that we use a translog production function as a framework for estimating the relationships among economic growth and factor inputs. The factor inputs considered are: labour, physical capital, human capital (deriving from endogenous growth theory), and a monetary factor (money or credit, deriving from the theory of money in the production function). The translog production function enables a richer specification of the relationships among growth and factor inputs, than the more commonly used Cobb-Douglas approach, as it allows for interactions among factor inputs. We find significant evidence of such interactions, suggesting that studies which ignore such interactions are likely to be misleading. Overall, our results suggest that financial development is at least as important as human capital in the growth process.

It is found that the volatility in both the London and New York markets leads that of Tokyo. In addition, the New York market slightly leads the London market in its volatility. After the Euro monetary system crisis, the frequencies of both the volatility spillover effect from London to New York and mutual feedback phenomena have increased. Furthermore, the volatility spillover effects from London and New York to Tokyo have been on the rise after the Asian financial debacle. Within the framework of the causality model, we find better forecasting performance in predicting G-5 exchange rates across the three markets. It outperforms the traditional ARMA model in terms of both in- and out-sample forecasting.

Macroeconomic fundamentals and the dm/$ exchange rate: Temporal instability and the monetary model,2001,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035205037&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.166&partnerID=40&md5=32d2c7c0f68d18a0dce986d9d2fd8eb1,"The findings of this study lead to three conclusions. First, the process governing the short-run movement of exchange rates over periods of floating is episodically unstable. Second, the switching nature of the exchange rate process takes a striking form, namely that different sets of macroeconomic fundamentals matter for exchange rates during different time periods. Finally, it is difficult to reconcile these structural change findings with the monetary model with RE. The implausibility of relying on changes in the structure of the model under RE as a way to explain the temporal instability of the monetary model suggests that what is required is an alternative expectational framework that breaks the rigid connection between expectations functions and the one 'true' semi-reduced form. The TCE framework achieves this end by recognizing that agents possess a pluralism of theories with which to look forward and it assumes that their theories provide only qualitative knowledge about how the exchange rate might be related to some set of fundamentals.25 With imperfect knowledge, as formulated by the TCE framework, agents may change the theories (or sets of fundamentals) they use to forecast exchange rate movements from one time period to another. It is this possibility of changing beliefs that allows the monetary model with TCE to be reconciled with the our finding that different sets of macroeconomic fundamentals matter for short-run exchange rate movements during different time periods. The conclusion is that if one is prepared to move away from the RE paradigm and recognize that market agents possess imperfect knowledge, then plausible interpretations of the connection between floating exchange rates and macroeconomic fundamentals might after all become possible.",Cointegrating VARS; Exchange rates; Monetary models; Temporal instability,currency market; exchange rate; macroeconomics; structural change

It concentrates on the effects of the December 1994 Mexican crisis on the risk assessment (as measured by the stripped spread) of Poland, another Brady country. The main findings are: (i) over the sample period, the unit root hypothesis on the risk premium (measured by the stripped spread) of Mexico and Poland cannot be rejected; this is consistent with the idea that the risk premium reflects new information accruing to the market; (ii) comovements in stripped spreads between Mexico and Poland were stronger during the period of the Peso crisis: we do not reject the null of cointegration for the year that includes the crisis (July 1994-July 1995), but we do reject the null for the year starting 6 months after the crisis (July 1995-July 1996); (iii) the crisis has had a strong permanent effect on the risk assessment of Mexico with respect to the one of Poland (550 basis points circa).

Assessing inflation targeting after a decade of world experience,2001,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035202840&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.165&partnerID=40&md5=c34642ef05d8333f0b9b9411bed5d17e,"Ten years of inflation targeting worldwide provide valuable lessons. Inflation targeters (ITers) have been very successful in meeting their inflation targets (ITs). Industrial output sacrifice during inflation stabilization and industrial output volatility has frequently been lowered after IT adoption. ITers have consistently reduced inflation forecast errors after IT adoption. The influence of price and output shocks on the behaviour of inflation and output gaps has changed much more strongly among ITers than in non-targeting industrial countries in the course of the 1990s. IT has played a role in strengthening the effect of forward-looking expectations on inflation, hence weakening the weight of past inflation inertia. Central bankers' aversion to inflation is, on average, not different among ITers in comparison to NITers but has risen in emerging-country ITers. ITers have gradually reaped a credibility gain, allowing them to achieve their targets with smaller changes in interest rates in the late 1990s than the changes that were required in the early 1990s.

In general, pull factors have a heavier weight in determining these capital flows. However, short-term dynamics of capital flows can be significantly influenced by external developments. Simulations under various economic scenarios show that while financial variables (such as the US interest rate and high-yield spread) are important, real US activity may be even more potent in influencing capital flow movements.

Market structure and the persistence of sectoral real exchange rates,2001,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035038736&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.151&partnerID=40&md5=033c56cc9986b1c5e1c25003e12925a2,"We examine the relationship between market structure and the persistence of US dollar-based sectoral real exchange rates for 14 OECD countries. Our empirical results based on disaggregated data suggest that differences in market structure significantly determine the rates at which deviations from sectoral purchasing power parity decay. Specifically, industries with a larger price-cost margin are found to exhibit slower parity reversion of their sectoral real exchange rates. Further, as the degree of intra-industry trade activity increases, sectoral real exchange rate persistence becomes more pronounced. These findings suggest that an imperfectly competitive market structure contributes to the well-documented persistence in real exchange rates.

Results confirm that most traders use both forecasting approaches, and that the shorter the forecasting horizon, the more important chartist/technical analysis is. Financial journalists put more emphasis on fundamental analysis than do foreign exchange traders. Results indicate that the importance of chartism may have increased over the last decade. Regarding the use of chartist/technical and fundamental analysis on seven forecasting horizons, four distinct clusters of traders can be identified. Forecasting styles and the overall importance attached to fundamental versus chartist/technical analysis vary across different trading locations. Foreign exchange traders mention a series of psychological motives and consequences of the use of chartism.

The ECB monetary policy strategy and the money market,2001,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035202838&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.163&partnerID=40&md5=9f617a5b61e171bc2ab00dc8861644a6,"This paper aims at contributing to the understanding of how the ECB conducts monetary policy as seen from a money market perspective. More specifically it covers two different issues. First, it looks at the 'learning period' for banks since the Eurosystem started implementing the single monetary policy. It shows that during the first three weeks of 1999 the narrow corridor in place during this period was effective in limiting daily volatility of the money market overnight rates. In addition, the behaviour of banks and market rates during this period provides evidence that learning was taking place. Second, it looks at how well money market participants have anticipated the monetary policy decisions taken by the ECB. To do so, the paper analyses whether the announcements of monetary policy decisions to maintain or change interest rates impact on the stochastic behaviour of interest rates. Looking at the EONIA rates within the reserve maintenance periods, we find that the announcement of monetary policy decisions does not change significantly the level or volatility of overnight rates.

Real exchange rate effects on the balance of trade: Cointegration and the Marshall-Lerner condition,2001,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034910636&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.157&partnerID=40&md5=4fc9d34590a07f548735ae4acc4db3d4,"A typical finding in the empirical literature is that import and export demand elasticities are rather low, and that the Marshall-Lerner (ML) condition does not hold. However, despite the evidence against the ML condition, the consensus is that real devaluations do improve the balance of trade, though after a lag because of J-curve effects. The aim of this paper is to try and measure the effects of the real exchange rate on the balance of payments using structural cointegrating vector autoregressive distributed lag (VARDL) models for domestic and foreign output, the balance of trade and the real exchange rate. Small systems are estimated for eight OECD countries to investigate long-run cointegration. Generalized impulse response functions are calculated to investigate the response to shocks. These show evidence of J-effects. The VARDL estimates suggest a single cointegrating vector and that output and the real exchange rate can be treated as weakly exogenous for the parameters of the balance of payment equation. This allows estimation using a single-equation ARDL. Although there is considerable heterogeneity, overall the results suggest that the ML condition is satisfied in the long run.

These rules are: Full Price Stability, Taylor, Fixed and Managed Exchange Rates. I find, first, that the exchange rate dynamic is non-stationary unless some form of management is undertaken by the respective monetary authorities of the two countries. However, eliminating the excess volatility of the exchange rate does not significantly alter the overall macroeconomic volatility. Second, a floating exchange rate regime based on a Taylor-type rule seems to better approximate the full price stability benchmark, but at the cost of boosting interest rate volatility. In this respect limiting exchange rate flexibility is desirable. Finally, in all cases the model delivers positive cross-country correlation of interest rates but negative cross-country correlation of output.

Why is the business-cycle behaviour of fundamentals alike across exchange-rate regimes?,2001,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035194717&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.169&partnerID=40&md5=d4693b64df7023f1f1d54dec185ffa87,"Since the adoption of flexible exchange rates, real exchange rates have been much more volatile than they were under Bretton Woods. However, the volatilities of most other macroeconomic variables have remained approximately unchanged. This poses a puzzle for standard international business cycle models. This paper develops a two-country, two-sector model with nominal rigidities featuring deviations from the law of one price due to firms setting prices in buyers' currencies. By partially insulating goods markets across countries and thus mitigating the international expenditure-switching effect, this pricing behaviour is found to considerably dampen the responses of quantities to shocks hitting the economies therefore helping to account for the puzzle.

Developing countries' borrowing in the international finance market with an uncertain credit ceiling,2001,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035042292&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.153&partnerID=40&md5=abdc44ad41b89c65a654c1e705df4fd1,"In the sovereign debt literature of the 1980s, countries formulated optimal borrowing plans subject to a credit ceiling imposed by their lenders. This paper analyzes the case where the credit ceiling is not known with certainty. The baseline deterministic model shows that consumption, investment and the current account deficit depend positively on the credit ceiling, implying more optimistic expectations about the country's future access to external financing led to larger current account deficits today. An extension of the model shows that when the country recognizes the uncertainty about future access to borrowing, optimal current account deficits are more moderate.

It is questionable whether non-US investors relate their investment decisions on US ratings and whether ratings from US agencies are relevant information sources for international capital markets. This paper examines daily excess eurobond returns associated with announcements of watchlistings and rating changes by Standard and Poor's and Moody's. Significant bond price reactions are observed for announcements of downgradings and negative watchlistings while upgradings and positive watchlistings do not cause announcement effects. Distinct from the results on national capital markets the international evidence shows that besides actual yield level and issuer type the issuer nationality is a key factor that determines the intensity of price reactions after downgrades. The price reaction is also significantly stronger for downgrades into speculative grade. This indicates, that the announcement effects can in part be explained by price pressure effects due to regulatory constraints rather than original information content of rating changes.

A comparison of institutional development in China and India suggests that new entry rather than the rehabilitation approach may work more favorably to reduce non-performing assets. The paper offers an explanation as to why governments choose rehabilitation over new entry.

The main findings of the analysis are: (i) in contrast to the findings of previous studies using monthly rates, GARCH processes characterize the drachma/dollar exchange rate series in both markets; (ii) the relaxation of foreign exchange controls increased the volatility of the exchange rate in the official market as implied by theory; (iii) the persistence of volatility is reduced when account is taken of the liberalization process of capital movements; and (iv) The forecasts of volatility are improved when the GARCH forecasts are used against traditional measures.

Specifically, we apply the so-called Extended Davidson's Methodology (EDM), which is based on the innovative concept of an irreducible cointegrating (IC) vector, defined as a subset of a cointegrating relation that does not have any cointegrated subsets. Ranking the irreducible vectors according to the criterion of minimum variance allows us to distinguish between structural and solved relations. The empirical results provide support for the hypothesis that larger, more stable economies can achieve policy objectives more successfully by accommodating rather than driving other countries' policies. It appears that the driving force is Canada, which is linked to the USA, UK and France in three out of the four fundamental relations, and which is a reference point for the US, Italian and German rates, which are not cointegrated, seem to be determined by country-specific factors.

To date, however, these three elements of monetary frameworks have been assessed in isolation from one another, and all have been viewed in terms of a unidimensional spectrum of fixity versus flexibility. Using a newly constructed dataset, this paper jointly analyses and compares all three elements' effects on inflation and exchange rate behaviour. The results show that each of the three elements has independent and distinct effects on nominal outcomes. Key findings include: (1) Although hard pegs do tend to reduce inflation and attenuate exchange rate fluctuations within some range, they are clearly characterized by large devaluations; (2) Central bank autonomy is associated with a more stable exchange rate and lower inflation; and (3) Explicit inflation targeting reduces both inflation and its persistence, consistent with the view that inflation targeting increases flexibility through transparency. These results raise the possibility that a combination of central bank autonomy, inflation targeting, and a free float might offer the same benefits as any intermediate exchange rate regime on its own, without the proclivity to occasional large depreciations.

The reason is that the history of the European monetary unification is characterized by slow, but steady, progress in the face of constant scepticism and predictions of catastrophes. During the times when the Maastricht Treaty was being finalized, many observers considered Stage Three of the introduction of the Economic and Monetary Union as an infeasible and unlikely leap in the dark-and, to be honest, I have to confess that I myself was not known for being an euro-enthusiast either. Traditional considerations based on the optimum currency area literature were often used to criticize the concept of monetary union in Europe. And there were widespread beliefs that the necessary political consensus would never possibly have formed around the idea of a voluntary relinquishing of monetary independence on the part of national authorities. National interest would allegedly have prevailed over the wider common interest. These criticisms appeared to be validated at each occurrence of a large shock, be it the German unification or the ERM crisis. Even in 1998, when the launch of the euro was supposedly only a matter of time, there were observers suggesting that financial markets would strain and eventually prove unsustainable the promise of an irrevocable locking of bilateral central parities. Then, sceptics noted the historically unique situation created by the asymmetry between, on the one hand, a single central bank and, on the other, eleven-twelve as of January 2001-national governments. More recently, the criticism centred on the most difficult initial decision of the European Central Bank, the development of a monetary policy strategy suitable for the new environment of Monetary Union. The ECB strategy was described as inappropriate for the euro area, too opaque, inconsistent with the economic thinking currently in fashion and ultimately conducive to bad monetary policy.",,Europe; currency market; economic integration; exchange rate; monetary policy; Single European Market

The paper finds that, for countries with weak economic fundamentals and low reserves, political instability has a strong impact on economic vulnerability. The estimation results suggest that including political variables in economic models does improve their power to explain and predict economic crises. The paper concludes that countries are more economically vulnerable during, and especially following, election periods, and when election results are less stable than at other times.

In this paper, we argue that the logical links between Granger causality and cost of carry have not previously been correctly set out. We show that causality tests must be set in the framework of an error correction model (ECM) and that this is also the appropriate framework within which to test cost of carry theory. We, therefore, use a single unified framework to test both causality and cost of carry. Within this framework, we show that, under reasonable assumptions, cost of carry requires that there must be some causal relationships between futures and spot prices, and that cost of carry may be consistent with either bi-or unidirectional causality. We use our specification to study the pricing of the French CAC-40 (CAC: Compagnie des Agents de Change) stock index futures contract. We find that the data are consistent with cost of carry only in the first period of the data, when causality only runs from spot to futures but not later, when causality is either bidirectional or runs from futures to spot. These results provide little support for the view that stock index futures necessarily lead spot and suggest the need for a reconsideration of the theory and evidence on stock index futures pricing.

Using a panel of 19 OECD currencies, 1973-1997, we employ different panel unit root approaches to investigate the view that this effect can be attributed to neglected cross-sectional dependence. While the results from panel methods which permit cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneous serial correlation generally support long-run PPP, they provide no evidence of a base currency effect.

In the early part of the nineteenth century, the American economy switched from an inter-regional flexible exchange rate regime to a monetary union under the aegis of the SBUS. The evolution of inflation rates was not without affecting the transition process towards this union. There is, however, a mixed empirical evidence of a quick convergence of regional inflation rates following the creation of the Bank. This may be explained in two ways. On the one hand, the transition process involved both convergence of price indices and inflation rates. On the other hand, the Bank encountered credibility problems in implementing a consistent monetary policy at the federal level. In such a context, the viability of the transition seems to have hinged, in part, on the political appeal of the American Union for its members.

Exchange rate risk and two-way foreign direct investment,2000,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033885470&doi=10.1002%2f1099-1158%28200007%295%3a3%3c221%3a%3aAID-IJFE126%3e3.0.CO%3b2-J&partnerID=40&md5=7eef8e8c22682de3d086a558be75528a,"Modern theory of foreign direct investment (FDI) identifies market frictions such as transport costs and tariffs as major obstacles to a firm's access to foreign markets and as important reasons for two-way FDI. An alternative rationale for two-way FDI is offered in the present paper from a theoretical examination of the relation between exchange rate risk and FDI. In a one sector two-country model, it is assumed that producers decide both the domestic and the foreign production capacities so as to maximize the utility function based on rates of return and real exchange rates. It is shown that two-way FDI occurs when deviations from the purchasing power parity are not significant. The higher the exchange rate volatility, the larger the ratio of FDI to export. Two-way FDI reduces the producers' exchange rate risk; under certain conditions, this reduction of exchange rate risk is a driving force for two-way FDI.

In this context, the long-run equilibrium aggregate capital stock is unambiguously higher than in the absence of the interest rate ceiling, even though its relationship with the ceiling is non-monotonic. Empirical results using aggregate panel data from 52 developing countries for the period 1974-1988 provide support for the model, particularly in economies that have some access to international capital markets.

This criticism ignores the effects of interest rate policy on the incentives to restructure corporate debt once it has become strategically optimal for domestic firms to declare a state of over-indebtedness. A widespread state of debt moratoria constitutes a 'bad' equilibrium, whereas the widespread adoption of a quick debt workout strategy is a potentially 'good' equilibrium. The latter can be encouraged through various policies, most controversially a short-term policy of high interest rates. Other potential policies include: (i) widespread debt forgiveness; (ii) enhanced implementation of the bankruptcy court; and (iii) the enforcement of free market competition.

Which corporate hedging motives are appropriate?

Our results indicate that in some cases, the views of institutional investors are similar to those of the treasury managers of UK multinational companies (MNCs). However, we found other important cases where the views of institutional investors differ from the hedging practices of firms. For example, institutional investors place a strong degree of importance on the hedging motive that is associated with financial distress. This result contrasts with earlier evidence from MNCs themselves. Our findings have important implications for theoretical work that is associated with agency considerations and the extent to which the firm communicates its financial policies to investors.

Journal of Econometrics 64: 307-333], the switching autoregresive conditional heteroskedastic (SWARCH) model, which is a more general specification than the popular ARCH model, is used. An exponential SWARCH model is fitted to eight series of weekly returns from international stock markets. Evidence is found for switching volatility for the US, Canada, the UK, and Japan. Under the SWARCH model, it is found that ARCH and asymmetric effects are reduced when a switching regime structure is allowed. The switching model is used to date volatility states in international stock markets. These states are compared and it is concluded that domestic volatility states tend to be independent of foreign volatility states, with the exception of Japan and the UK, and the US and Canada. For these two pairs of series, evidence is found for common volatility states. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.",ARCH; Structural change; Volatility,market conditions; stock market

This presents an asset pricing puzzle and has been used as a justification for the imposition of a 'windfall' tax. This paper presents a framework for analysing the composition of these returns and for judging the extent to which they can be regarded as abnormal. It provides evidence that even the existence of abnormal returns depends crucially on the assumptions made with regard to their measurement. A general model that allows for time variation in investors' perceptions of risk reveals that the extent of the abnormal returns is much smaller than first thought, being present in only very few companies. In most cases, the observed high stock returns appear to be a reward for bearing risk and should not be regarded as abnormal.

The black market premium and the rate of inflation in a dual exchange rate regime,2000,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034109655&doi=10.1002%2f%28SICI%291099-1158%28200002%295%3a1%3c77%3a%3aAID-IJFE112%3e3.0.CO%3b2-A&partnerID=40&md5=9720778bd2a1c74b43dd951768c64ff3,"This paper examines the relationship between the black market premium and the rate of inflation under a dual exchange rate regime consisting of an official market and a black market. By explicitly specifying the implicit export tax associated with the government budget constraint in a dynamic optimizing context, the paper demonstrates that (1) for any given long-run rate of inflation, there exist two steady-state equilibria corresponding to a high premium and a low premium, and that (2) an increase in the rate of crawl of the official exchange rate has two effects on the premium, namely, the financing effect and the portfolio effect. Therefore, the conventional view that a trade-off exists between the black market premium and the rate of inflation when the inflation elasticity of money demand is less than unity does not generally hold. It is also shown that, although the implicit export tax vanishes when the two exchange rates are unified, the inflation tax may not increase because the unification increases the explicit export tax. This result also differs from the conventional view.

Inflation targets and the yield curve: New Zealand and Australia versus the US,2000,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034077246&doi=10.1002%2f%28SICI%291099-1158%28200002%295%3a1%3c15%3a%3aAID-IJFE114%3e3.0.CO%3b2-O&partnerID=40&md5=cd19afd8ccd70e6a1c5f2f2f2a780fa8,"This study considers whether the slope of the yield curve for New Zealand contains useful economic information. In order to provide some perspective, the present study also contrasts the New Zealand experience with evidence based on US and Australian data. The principal findings of this study are as follows: (1) At short horizons, typically 2 years or less, the term structure for New Zealand behaves as in the expectations hypothesis of the term structure. (2) Nevertheless, there are departures from the expectations hypothesis, especially in the period when inflation objectives in New Zealand were on a declining path. Moreover, the policies of the US had a critically important impact around 1993-1994. (3) Some evidence was found of an effect from the spread to future inflation but only when the headline CPI is used to measure inflation; the links disappear entirely once CPI ex-credit costs are employed. The study argues that such results are consistent with a credible inflation targeting regime, so that the term structure serves possibly to signal changes in real interest rates rather than inflation in New Zealand. (4) There is good evidence that the spread helps predict future output in New Zealand, although the effect seems to dissipate after 1 year. Once we distinguish between periods of positive versus negative growth rates in real gross domestic product (GDP), the spread influences output up to 2 years into the future. Also, when output growth is measured asymmetrically, rising inflation expectations depress output growth.

In particular we find that any explicit credible target zone for the exchange rate is associated with an implicit target zone for the stock price where the non-linearity of the exchange rate function translates into a corresponding stabilizing non-linearity of the stock price path.

It has been hypothesized that such characteristics may be due to time-varying factors such as the systematic risk associated with the futures position or cyclical factors associated with spot price forecasts. This note considers the extent to which these systematic influences can explain common variation in the spread between monthly spot and futures prices (the basis). The assets under consideration are: Aluminium and Copper futures, traded on the London Metal Market; and, Brent Crude Oil and Gas-Oil futures, traded on the London International Petroleum Exchange. The analysis covers the period June 1991 through September 1996. Using a portfolio approach to basis variation and multiple equation GMM estimation procedures, the hypothesis being tested is that conditional bases have a predictable component driven by a single unobservable source of risk. Movement in the price of systematic risk is proxied by ex ante variables that have been shown to have predictive power for returns from bond and stock markets. The results show that near-horizon, perfectly correlated commonalties exist across contract bases with similar maturities and that they are associated with systematic influences on spot price forecasts and on agents' perceptions regarding their futures market position.

In light of recent developments in the ERM it has become apparent that the original concept of speculative attack by Krugman (1979) does not suffice because it only allows for one time shift in portfolio and therefore excludes spot speculators who wish to sell back their holdings of foreign currency on a later date, thus restoring their original position in domestic currency. Unlike previous literature, my model indicates that the collapse of a fixed exchange rate can be accompanied with a discrete depreciation of the domestic currency, a phenomenon commonly observed in real currency crises, but absent from the previous models.

To improve our understanding of these events, researchers have undertaken new theoretical and empirical work. In this paper, we provide some perspective on this work and relate it to earlier research in the area. Then we derive the optimal commitment to a fixed exchange rate and propose a common framework for analyzing currency crises that draws from both the first-generation work and the more recent second-generation approach. The cross-generational framework stresses the important role of speculators and also recognizes that the government's commitment to a fixed exchange rate is constrained by other policy goals.

The dependent variable is daily purchases/sales of the Bank in the Treasury bill market. The short run objectives of the Bank identified are the avoidance of excessive fluctuations in market interest rates, of excessive fluctuations of the rouble exchange rate and of excessive influences of foreign exchange market interventions on the rouble monetary base. The paper finds a systematic and significant reaction of the Bank to changes in market yields, to deviations of the market exchange rate from the central rate of the narrow rouble - US dollar corridor, to changes in the regulations concerning repatriation of foreign capital and to changes in the differential between yields on taxable and nontaxable Treasury bills. The reaction of the Bank to the latter three variables reflects the desire to sterilize international reserve flows and to avoid excessive fluctuations of the rouble monetary base. However, the study also finds a significant change in behaviour in the period 1 April-17 June 1997 when in the face of very large capital inflows the Bank reinforced the effect of reserves inflows on the monetary base instead of sterilizing it. This change led to excessive growth in the money supply which may have aggravated the foreign exchange crisis in the last months of 1997.

It is also found that an anticipated monetary shock does not misadjust regardless of whether the system has one or two positive eigenvalues. In view of these results, we can thus conclude that the crucial factor for exchange rate misadjustment is the kind of anticipated shocks rather than the number of eigenvalues emphasized by Aoki.",Alternative price adjustment patterns; Anticipated shocks; Exchange rate misadjustment,economic conditions; exchange rate; price determination

We also present new versions of higher-moment market models of the data-generating process of the individual emerging markets and use these to identify model parameters.

Because reserve requirements are a tax, however, changes in reserve requirements can have real effects. This paper shows that the exact implications for output, the real exchange rate and the capital and current accounts depend importantly on who - whether depositors or borrowers - pays the tax. In any case, foreign exchange intervention matched by changes in reserve requirements that keep the money supply fixed do influence the exchange rate in the short and, sometimes, the long run. The recent experiences of ten developing countries establish that, while the incidence of the tax varies considerably across countries and time, both deposit and lending rates of interest respond to changes in reserve requirements.

Exchange rate undershooting,1999,International Journal of Finance and Economics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032707682&doi=10.1002%2f%28SICI%291099-1158%28199910%294%3a4%3c325%3a%3aAID-IJFE109%3e3.0.CO%3b2-6&partnerID=40&md5=22abc8a952011bc699a761c837cf22e4,"This paper reexamines the famous overshooting result derived by Dornbusch, which occurs when the economy is always operating at the level of full employment. When this assumption is abandoned and replaced with the more realistic assumption that output in the economy is variable but adjusts sluggishly, exchange rate undershooting can now occur. In this modified framework it remains true that asset markets adjust quickly but now both prices and real output adjust sluggishly. With sticky prices and output, monetary expansion causes interest rates to initially fall, just as in the Dornbusch model. However, contrary to the claim made by Dornbusch that the exchange rate necessarily overshoots when output adjusts sluggishly, the exchange rate may now either overshoot or undershoot. The intuitive explanation for undershooting is that monetary expansion causes the long-run equilibrium price level to rise, and this in turn may lead to the expectation that the domestic interest rate will rise. In that event, asset holders will expect the home currency to appreciate. However, if this expected appreciation is sufficiently strong, the home currency will have to undershoot to reduce the overall expected appreciation and maintain interest parity.",Exchange rate; Interest parity; Overshooting; Sluggish output adjustment; Undershooting,economic conditions; economic policy; exchange rate; interest rate

First, we find that proxies for financial factors enter significantly in behavioural equations for loan standards, loan demand, and aggregate demand. Second, we find strong evidence that financial factors contributed to Japan's recent recession. On the loan supply side, exogenous declines in equity prices appear to have led to a sharp increase in bank loan standards and a substantial subsequent decline in loans and economic activity. We also find some evidence that an exogenous contraction in loan supply may have lowered output by a small degree, but only in the early phases of the recession. On the loan demand side, asset price declines also led firms and households to sharply reduce their demand for bank loans and goods, although it is unclear how much this influence may reflect traditional wealth effects. In addition, loan demand shocks, which could reflect balance-sheet problems not captured by our model, account for much of the remainder of the shortfall in loans. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,Japan; bank lending; economic activity; national economy

Adding a new capital good requires a capital specific set-up cost, invested prior to using the capital good. Agents are disappointment averse, putting greater utility weight on downside risk (as modeled by Gul, 1991). Policy uncertainty is induced by 'revenue seeking' administrations, which tend to tax the 'quasi fixed' capital, ignoring long term costs. Disappointment aversion implies that investment, labor and capitalists income drop at a rate proportional to the standard deviation of the tax rate. Hence, policy uncertainty induces first-order adverse effects, wheras policy uncertainty leads to second-order effects when consumers maximize the conventional expected utility. The adverse effects of policy uncertainty can be partially overcome by a proper investment policy. The paper interprets the tax concessions granted to multinationals as a commitment device that helps overcoming the adverse implications of policy uncertainty.",,foreign direct investment; investment policy; theory; uncertainty; welfare economics

In contrast to the standard statistical methodology, the Hansen-Jagannathan methodology is fully non-parametric and based on only one principle from economic theory, namely the Law of One Price. From this principle feasible regions for mean-standard deviation pairs of stochastic discount factors can be derived using asset returns data. The empirical results show that if agents are very risk-averse, a simple time-separable power utility version of the C-CAPM does generate a stochastic discount factor with mean and standard deviation inside the feasible region.

There are two main innovations in the paper. One is the use of a model for excess returns in which the conditional covariance matrix of returns varies over time due to the simultaneous influence of four macroeconomic shocks. The other is the use of a likelihood ratio test for MVE calculated from analytical derivatives of the likelihood function in order to reduce the computational burden of these high parameter dimensional models. The model with macroeconomic shocks is compared with the multivariate ARCH-in-mean model. Although the macroeconomic shocks model is found to perform slightly better than the ARCH model, and both produce a significant and plausible estimate of the coefficient of risk aversion, the null hypothesis that the UK stockmarket is mean variance efficient is rejected for both models in favour of the alternative hypothesis that equity returns are an unrestricted linear function of asset shares. Another important finding is that the most important shocks affecting the UK stockmarket either have an international origin or are due to the bond market. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",ARCH; CAPM; Macroeconomic shocks; Mean variance efficiency,

Nevertheless, 'news' about future changes in short rates are far more important than the risk premium in explaining interest rate movements at the short end of the term structure, and comprise the main source of the single factor explanation that emerges from our results. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Cointegration; GMM; Rational expectations; Term structure; VAR,

Third, formal stability tests as described by Hansen and Johansen (1993) were used, and it is shown that the dimension of the cointegration space may exhibit sample dependency, but the estimated coefficients are not unstable in recursive estimations. Finally, a new efficient and consistent test that maintains the null of cointegration developed by Shin (1994) was utilized, and once again the evidence in favour of cointegration was accepted. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Cointegration; KPSS test; Parallel foreign exchange market; Temporal stability,

Empirical evidence on mean reversion has been mixed and less than supportive, however. Prior analyses are restricted to integer orders of integration only. This study provides a reappraisal of the evidence using fractional integration analysis. In addition, expected inflation is measured by inflation forecasts and not just by realized inflation rates. Empirical results strongly support that ex ante real interest rates exhibit mean reversion, but in a special manner not captured by the usual stationary processes.

Third, while German and US spreads are frequently significant in the regressions for the other countries, the added information is limited except in Japan and the UK.

A positive money demand shock raises consumption and holdings of foreign assets and appreciates the real exchange rate in the long run; it has an ambiguous effect on real money balances on impact. A positive productivity shock in the traded goods sector also leads to a long-run real appreciation (the Balassa-Samuelson effect), but the impact effect on relative prices is ambiguous. An increase in government spending on home goods leads to a real appreciation in the long run, but it has an ambiguous effect on the economy's stock of net foreign assets. The dynamic effects associated with a reduction in the world interest rate depend on the degree of intertemporal substitution in consumption and the initial asset position of private agents. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Capital flows; Optimizing models; Real exchange rate determination,capital flows; exchange rates; monetary demand

To do this we use two different econometric models, each with its own information set. One is a UK model using current (to 1995) information; the other a multicountry model with information as known in early 1992. We therefore examine the question with the benefit of hindsight and as the policy makers could have seen it at the time. The results are the same. Sterling's exit produced a period of recovery, real growth and little extra inflationary pressure. Excess capacity and competition in the labour markets may have led to lower inflation pressures. However, it was lower interest rates which proved growth creating in the UK, rather than sterling's devaluation, which proved growth diverting. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Competitive devaluations; Exchange rate regimes; Output gap,UK; currency devaluation; economic impact; exchange rate mechanism; national economy; quantitative assessment

We show that sturdy lag structures between inflation and monetary growth imply that the two models are observationally equivalent in the short run. Using indirect information from other asset markets, however, allows us to differentiate between the two explanations. We find fairly sturdy evidence that expectations regarding future inflation shifted downward in early 1995, suggesting that the subsequent increase in monetary growth to a significant extent satisfied increased real ruble demand, with limited inflation impact.",Exchange rate; Inflation; Interest rate; Ruble; Stabilization,

This conjecture is borne out in the present paper by the evidence that the business cycle affiliation of ERM member countries has shifted from the United States to Germany since the formation of the ERM. This effect is bolstered by growing links in trade and finance between the European countries.

In response to this problem, Frankel and Froot (1988) developed a model where two approaches are used to forecast the exchange rate. The fundamentalist approach, where the forecast is based upon economic fundamentals, continues to be used. This model's innovation is that the chartist approach, where the forecast is based upon the past behaviour of the exchange rate, is also used. A feature of this chartist-and-fundamentalist (c&f) model is that these two approaches' relative importance varies over time. As this weighting is unobserved, the c&f model cannot be estimated or tested using standard techniques. We purpose to use Markov regime-switching techniques to overcome these difficulties and test the model. By defining the two groups' different methods of forecasting as regimes, we rewrite the c&f model as a regime-switching model. This approach is used here to test for chartist and fundamentalist behaviour in the Canada-US daily exchange rate between 1983 and 1992. We find favourable though inconclusive evidence for the c&f model. Accordingly, we make suggestions for further research. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Chartists; Exchange rates; Fundamentalists; Markov regime-switching,

A feature of the market for sovereign loans, hitherto neglected, has been the leadership role played by a small group of major international money-centre banks and their subsequent influence over a much larger grouping of smaller, regional banks. Lending behaviour amongst such creditor heterogeneity is captured using a signalling model that takes into account the incomplete information environment created by sovereign risk. Our main finding is that the herd-like behaviour of the late 1970s and early 1980s may have, in part, been generated by large money-centre banks seeking to capitalise on their ability to influence the inferences and actions of their smaller rivals.",Debt crisis; International lending; Sovereign risk,bank lending; bank role; debt crisis; developing world; market structure

Such a method appears to represent an innovation for empirical research on the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT). As a result, the APT factors are identified which are based on the intuition of the APT and, hence, we have a better APT model with which we could successfully relate the factors most closely to identifiable sources of economic risk.

The news is associated with the surprise component of the monthly release of six US macroeconomic variables. The results suggest that dollar exchange rates systematically react to news about real economic activity - a surprise of 100000 on non-farm payroll employment leads to a 0.2% appreciation of the exchange rate. In general, exchange rates do not react systematically to news on inflation. In contrast, US interest rates respond to both types of news, although the response continues to be extremely small, of the order of 1 to 2 basis points. Finally, Japanese interest rates systematically react, but to a very minor extent, to news about US real economic activity, while German rates, in general, do not. © 1997 by John Wiley & sons, Ltd.",Announcement effects; Exchange rates; Interest rates,

Corporate treasury managers' perceptions of (1) stakeholders' attitudes to risk and (2) the behaviour of financial markets are also examined. The results indicate that the primary motive for corporate hedging is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange (FX) rate fluctuation on operational cash flow. Motives which relate to the extra compensation required by bondholders and substantial guarantees required by customers and suppliers for bearing FX risk have minor impacts on hedging decisions. The study also examines the extent to which the motives emphasized by firms have impacts on the variability of specific financial variables as well as on non-financial variables. Our results indicate some consistency with the emphasis firms place on certain hedging motives and the expected impacts on those variables.

One of the difficulties in determining this is the absence of a broadly acceptable measure of economic convergence. In this paper we consider possible definitions of convergence for time series. To be useful the definition must allow for the stochastic nature of the data under consideration, and for the development of formal tests of a convergence hypothesis. These two considerations lead us to a preferred definition of convergence and a proposed framework for testing, based on a time varying parameter formulation and estimation by Kalman filter techniques. We consider the relationship between our proposed framework and other methods for testing convergence. It is argued that our method encompasses most of the tests that exist in the literature. Tests for convergence are then applied to exchange rates, interest rates and inflation rates for a sample of countries including members of the ERM. We conclude that the ERM may have helped to promote convergence in the nominal exchange rates. Although interest rate differentials have declined, convergence does not seem to be occurring. For inflation rates convergence can be rejected. Taken together these results suggest reasons for the recent disruption to the ERM and bring into question its sustainability. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Convergence; Europe; Monetary convergence; Real convergence; Stationarity,Europe; Economic and Monetary Union; economic convergence; methodological approach; time series analysis

In contrast to previous treatments of market-driven fundamentals within the regime, authorities stochastically counteract movements in these fundamentals before asset prices reach boundary points. This paper describes how the stabilizing intra-regime intervention policies can be used to characterize the behaviour of monetary authorities before fixing an exchange rate, as in the cases studied by R. P. Flood and P. Garber. An intervention policy within target zone bands consistent with empirical evidence is also a member of this class of policies.

I argue that financial and liquidity considerations - as opposed to current account sustainability or real exchange rate considerations - appear to have played a prominent role. Special attention is given to financial factors in Latin America. On this basis it is concluded that Mexico and Argentina were particularly vulnerable to speculative attacks. For contrast, the experience of Austria is examined and compared with that of Mexico. The analysis suggests that the remarkable stability of Austria - which pegged its currency to the Deutsche Mark for more than 15 years - may be due to the low volatility of its monetary aggregates. I also argue that financial factors could account for multiple self-fulfilling equilibria, helping to explain the sudden and deep reversals in Mexico and Argentina. It concludes with a discussion on policy implications. I suggest that, aside from the usual fiscal prudence advice, countries should pay special attention to the banking system and the maturity of public debt. Furthermore, the appropriateness of an exchange rate regime should take into account the characteristics of the financial sector.",Balance-of-payment crisis; Exchange rate; Inflation; Multiple equilibria; Volatility,Argentina; Mexico; capital flows; developing region; financial crisis; macroeconomic management; tequila effect

The periods of volatility appear at times of realignments of the central parities and at times when the exchange rate is within the ERM bands. We begin by considering a procedure for finding outliers based on measuring distance as a quadratic form. The evidence suggests that the exchange rates of the EMS can be described by a mixture of two distributions. We therefore model the exchange rate as switching between two distributions-one that holds in stable times and the other that holds in volatile times. In particular, we use Hamilton's Markov-switching model. In addition, we extend Hamilton's model by allowing the probability of switching from one state to another to depend on the position of the exchange rate within its EMS band. This model has the interesting implication that near the edge of the band, large movements - either realignments or large jumps to the centre of the band - are more likely if the move to the edge of the band has been precipitous.",EMS; ERM; Exchange rates; Markov-switching model,

The exchange market crisis in Mexico and the lingering negative impact on the Mexican economy have led to renewed calls for greater official participation and control of international capital movements. In fact, many developing countries have imposed controls designed to reduce or alter the composition of capital inflows. In this paper we review familiar arguments about capital controls and attempt to evaluate a 'new' distortion that might justify government interventions in international capital markets. The idea is straightforward. Emerging markets inherited distorted domestic credit markets from a model of economic development that placed the state in the centre of financial intermediation. Liberalization of these domestic markets is proceeding but far from complete. During the transition, incentives can emerge that make capital inflows welfare reducing. Free deposit insurance is an obvious distortion. But less obvious chains of implicit 'insurance' can also cause problems. We argue that fixed exchange rates and solvency can be a deadly combination for governments with a history of heavy involvement with domestic financial markets.",Capital controls; Emerging markets; Speculation,capital control; capital controls; developing world; exchange rate policy; financial liberalisation; financial market; market regulation

The goal is to discover why interest rates remained high, failing to converge to US levels, despite capital market liberalization and a resurgence of portfolio capital inflows during the second half of this sample period. Related questions are whether portfolio capital flows are strong enough to equalize expected returns between these 'emerging markets' and the US, and whether there is any scope left for the authorities to sterilize inflows. The conclusion of the study is that the largest single component of the gap in interest rates is expectations of depreciation of the local currencies against the dollar. The key to the analysis is the use of survey data on exchange rate forecasts by market participants. Indicative of integrated financial markets, we also find a big effect of US interest rates on local interest rates, and a highly significant degree of capital flow offset to monetary policy.",Capital account offset; Emerging markets; Mexican crisis; Portfolio capital flows; Sterilization; Uncovered interest parity,"Asia, (East); Latin America; capital flows; interest rate"

We consider a global economy where manufacturing is monopolistic-competitive, and productivity is subject to country-specific shocks. Labour is risk averse and immobile across countries, and entrepreneurs are risk neutral. Labour employment and income are governed by implicit contracts, which offer stable real income and volatile employment. Capacity investment is irreversible, and is done prior to the resolution of uncertainty. If investment in manufacturing capacity is characterized by returns to scale, higher volatility of productivity shocks is shown to induce producers to diversify internationally by means of FDI. The resultant integrated equilibrium is characterized by greater volatility of employment, as the multinational effectively reallocates employment from a low-realized-productivity to a high-realized-productivity country. We derive a simple condition characterizing cyclical dumping - it occurs when the percentage shortfall of the realized employment exceeds Lerner's ratio of market power (the inverse of the demand elasticity). Cyclical dumping is more frequent in more competitive and more labour-intensive industries. FDI is shown both to improve welfare, and to increase the incidences of cyclical dumping.",Cyclical dumping; Foreign direct investment; Implicit contracte,cyclical dumping; employment impact; foreign direct investment; international trade

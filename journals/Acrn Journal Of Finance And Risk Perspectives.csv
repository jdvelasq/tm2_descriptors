"Social finance and sustainable development goals: A literature synthesis, current approaches and research agenda","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093652297&doi=10.35944%2fJOFRP.2020.9.1.010&partnerID=40&md5=5c1fc59ca86d34c4d935c8ba9fc89ab7","The debate, especially in policy circles, around the emergence of Social and Sustainable Finance (SSF), depict as ‘paradoxical’ the contrast between SSF as a relatively underdeveloped field of knowledge and thought, and yet as an area of practice with ‘vast potential’ that is experiencing an ‘explosion’ in practitioner numbers. Such potential, in term of economic and social value that SSF can deliver, is reflected in the increasing of interest within the public policy-making arena in the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). More in detail, it is also underlined by the raising of public and private investment into promoting and supporting them. Within such evolving arena, the exact scale and scope of SSF’s contribution to the improvement of SDGs worldwide is difficult to delineate and measure accurately, but there seems to be universal agreement that SDGs represent an ideal and widespread area where SSF can register a significant growth. However, limited research addressed the marriage of these two fields. The purpose of this research are: i) to shed light on existing academic literature embracing both Social and Sustainable Finance and SDGs issues, ii) explore emerging trends deriving from international policy-making actors, market builders, managers, senior academics and, iii) to identify the main areas for further research focusing on SSF and SDGs. In order to derive a research agenda about such emerging research topic, the study adopts a triangulated approach based on qualitative mixed methods. With such objectives in mind, the study provides an extensive literature review in order to depict a comprehensive overview of existing knowledge considering both SSF and SDGs topics. The analysis is therefore enhanced by the trends identified from literature deriving from public policy- making actors and market-builders as well as from invited commentaries on SSF from senior scholars and managers. Thus, a holistic perspective on SSF experience, useful to identify the main areas for further research on SSF in the sustainability industry, was derived. The study, therefore, aims to provides, through a triangulated analysis of the concepts, frameworks and trends, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms for managing the interplay between SSF and SDGs, by highlight future avenues of research in this field. © 2020 by the authors.

"The effects of global financial crisis on the behaviour of European banks: A risk and profitability analysis approach","2018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054740886&partnerID=40&md5=833d1910abd6fca917ec3e4cb0e95be7","The effects of global financial crisis have been severe on banks. Many banks went bankrupt and many are in distress due to their sensitivities, stored in their balance sheets, to financial risks enlarged by the crisis. Some of banks, on the other hand, have felt the effects slightly. Recalling that total risk is sum of two parts of risk namely; volatility and sensitivity and that volatility is not under the discretion of banks, i.e. externally determined, it is assumed that the degree of banks getting affected by the global financial crisis is largely dependent on their sensitivities to risks. Banks' sensitivities to risks are assumed to be under the control of banks. Thus, in line with their risk appetite, banks can always change the structure of their balance sheet to alter their sensitivities to financial and non financial risks. In this paper it is targeted to analyze and compare the balance sheet structure banks from 27 European countries in order to find their sensitivities to different financial risks such as credit risk and liquidity risk. It will further be analyzed how banks' balance sheet structures have been altered after the crisis. To observe the behavioural variations (if there is any) of banks getting affected by financial crisis, the analysis is widened to include different characteristics of banks such as; the country where they are operating, region where they are belong to, scale of their operations, their ownership, their type and etc. © 2018 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

"Corporate Social Responsibility as a managerial learning process","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107133489&doi=10.35944%2fJOFRP.2021.10.1.005&partnerID=40&md5=35677b7d3bd0843e15d1884b52549ac6","The purpose of this paper is twofold. 1) We propose for the first time in the literature a theory (managerial learning hypothesis) that may explain why managers engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR). 2) We use an intuitive empirical methodology (Edmans et al. 2017) to test the relevance/irrelevance of our new theory. The idea behind our main contribution is that managers engage in CSR to learn new relevant information from other informed stakeholders. In return, managers will use both the new information and other information they already have to choose the optimal level of firm's investment (Jayaraman and Wu, 2019). Therefore, we propose to examine whether a strong CSR engagement improves revelatory efficiency (Edmans et al. 2012, 2017). The latter accounts for the extent to which stock prices reveal new information to managers that will help them make value-maximizing choices. Our findings suggest that CSR activities do not allow firm's managers to extract new information from their stock prices and ultimately improve the efficiency of their investment choices. © 2021 by the authors.

It is expected that the new dimensions of financial indicators be found. Both Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis is used in analyzing the data. Data are taken from 120 companies listed in Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX). Twenty financial indicators from the financial reports of each company are identified. While it has been a common practice to use ratio in indicating financial performance, it is not common to use an individual value from financial statements as financial indicators. This study shows that financial indicators can be grouped into four dimensions; they are Operational Performance, Asset-Income Performance, Owner Returns Performance and Leverage Performance. All of the non-ratio indicators that are expressed in the amount are grouped in the Asset-Income Performance dimension. New dimensions of financial performance indicators that do not commonly exist in this study, they are Asset-Income, and Leverage Performance. With the new dimension, non-financial performances such as customer satisfaction, corporate social responsibility, reputation, nepotism, and professionalism may be detected. © 2020 by the authors.

"Economic and financial transactions govern business cycles","2019","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077468195&doi=10.35944%2fjofrp.2019.8.1.001&partnerID=40&md5=b88cbb077cbcb74fa3e91d63656dc2fc","Problem/Relevance - This paper presents new description of the business cycles that for decades remain as relevant and important economic problem. Research Objective/Questions - We propose that econometrics can provide sufficient data for assessments of risk ratings for almost all economic agents. We use risk ratings as coordinates of agents and show that the business cycles are consequences of collective change of risk coordinates of agents and their financial variables. Methodology - We aggregate similar financial variables of agents and define macro variables as functions on economic space. Economic and financial transactions between agents are the only tools that change their extensive variables. We aggregate similar transactions between agents with risk coordinates x and y and define macro transactions as functions of x and y. We derive economic equations that describe evolution of macro transactions and hence describe evolution of macro variables. Major Findings - As example we study simple model that describes interactions between Credits transactions from Creditors at x to Borrowers at y and Loan-Repayment transactions that describe refunds from Borrowers at y to Creditors at x. We show that collective motions of Creditors and Borrowers from safer to risky area and back on economic space induce frequencies of macroeconomic Credit cycles. Implications - Our model can improve forecasting of the business cycles and help increase economic sustainability and financial policy-making. That requires development of risk ratings methodologies and corporate accounting procedures that should correspond each other to enable risk assessments of economic agents. © 2019 ACRN Oxford Ltd.","Business cycle; Economic space; Economic transactions; Risk assessment",""
"Are strategies for international diversification by country, industry and region equivalent?","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117929040&doi=10.35944%2fjofrp.2021.10.1.011&partnerID=40&md5=faa4e68463701ee60395c33469d5a785","In this study, we examine whether international portfolio diversification still matters despite an increase in the cross-country correlations of assets returns. More specifically, we explain why an increase in global return correlations does not necessarily imply a reduction in the benefits of international portfolio diversification. We also propose to compare empirically two traditional strategies of international diversification (by country and industry) in addition to a new strategy (by region) using two different methodological approaches, namely the mean variance spanning and multivariate cointegration analysis. Over the full sample period (1994-2008), our results suggest that the three strategies of international diversification remain effective despite the secular increase in the cross-country return correlations. When we divide the sample into two different sub-periods (1994-2000 and 2000-2008), the findings indicate that the strategy based on regional diversification proved to be a new competing strategy during the second period in comparison to the other two traditional strategies. © 2021 ACRN Oxford Ltd..

"Nordic green bond issuers’ views on the upcoming EU Green Bond Standard","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117942607&doi=10.35944%2fjofrp.2021.10.1.012&partnerID=40&md5=10e5abac1874962866d67b69dbcb5fad","The green bond market is growing and becoming increasingly important in green finance and for the transition to a low-carbon economy. Still, the green bond market is to a large extent unstandardised. There is no commonly agreed definition of the term ‘green’. This has been seen as one of the biggest challenges when it comes to the development of the green bond market. The need of a unified EU standard has been raised and as an effect the establishment of the EU Green Bond Standard is now in development. However, new standards might not only bring advantages, but also challenges. Striking the right balance of strictness might be hard. The research has been conducted through qualitative method with semi-structured interviews. Nine interviews were held during November and December 2020. The data was then analysed through thematic coding in order to find patterns of meaning. The results show that Nordic green bond issuers overall are positive towards the EU Green Bond Standard. The EU GBS has a good aim, to harmonise and enlarge the green bond market. However, the standard brings challenges that are to a large extent known challenges which the EU GBS aims to address, such as labour intensive reporting processes, lack of initiative and reputational risk. Also, it is argued that the standard is not fair and applicable for all the countries and companies. Countries national laws may not always go hand in hand with the standard. For example, the requirements for green buildings are seen as challenging in the Nordics. If these challenges are not taken into consideration, Nordic green bond issuers fear that the market will not grow, but instead decrease. Additionally, Nordic green bond issuers argue the adoption of the EU GBS is not a guarantee for issuers. Bigger institutes are seen to be early adopters. For other issuers investor requirement and positive impact on their company reputation is seen as the key drivers for adoption of the standard. © 2021 by the authors.

We propose a comprehensive typology of business models and use a variety of financial performance measures to test whether some business models do perform better than others. The findings indicate that all business models generate lower returns in comparison to a well diversified market portfolio. In addition, we have only weak evidence suggesting that some models (Productors and Streaming/Royalties) do have better financial performance than others. Overall, our results show that Canadian mining companies need to reevaluate the elements of their current business models. © 2017 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

We define the nth statistical moment of the price as the ratio of the nth statistical moment of the value to the nth statistical moment of the volume of all trades performed during an averaging time interval Δ. The set of the price statistical moments determines the price characteristic function and its Fourier transform defines the price probability measure. The price volatility depends on the 1st and the 2nd statistical moments of the value and the volume of the trades. The prediction of the price volatility requires a description of the sums of squares of the value and the volume of the market trades during the interval Δ and we call it the second-order economic theory. To develop that theory, we introduce numerical continuous risk ratings and distribute the agents by the risk ratings as coordinates. Based on distributions of the agents by the risk coordinates, we introduce a continuous economic media approximation that describes the collective trades. The agents perform the trades under the action of their expectations. We model the mutual impact of the expectations and the trades and derive equations that describe their evolution. To illustrate the benefits of our approach, in a linear approximation we describe perturbations of the mean price, the mean square price and the price volatility as functions of the first and the second-degree trades' disturbances. © 2021 by the authors.","Economic theory; Expectations; Market trades; Price probability; Volatility",""

Public goods are notoriously difficult for private firms to produce, because of the incentive for their constituents to defect, or free-ride, on the contributions of others. Due of their historical success, this paper examines long-lived religions institutions for strategies to mitigate this collective action problem. We empirically examine the Southern Baptist Convention, which records its efforts to finance international mission activities since 1935. We test a variation of the club good model, which emphasizes imposing costs on members to separate out high intensity adherents. Consistent with the model, we find that contributions to international missions increase when the cost of affiliation increases. We do not find that the specific mechanism for collection within the Southern Baptist matters. We conclude that the club model of organization, where high membership costs are deliberately applied, offers valuable – and counterintuitive – lessons for social enterprises more broadly. © 2017 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

The correlation research design was implored using a positivism approach. Descriptive statistics, correlation matrix, multiple regression, confirmatory analysis and T-test were used to analyze the data extracted from the annual report. Hence, the result of the study shows that corporate social responsibility has a negative impact on strategic risk. The confirmatory factor analysis found that CSR engagement influences strategic risk (SRK), but to varying degrees, contradicting findings from the Frontier Model, PCSE, and GLS that both sectors will have similar results if they engage in CSR effectively. It is therefore suggested that the management of strategic risks need to be more integrated in corporate strategy as the capacity to listen to business stakeholders' viewpoints on social and environmental issues becomes a competitive need. © 2023 ACRN Oxford Ltd..

We estimate semiparametric Cox proportional hazards models considering Andersen-Gill counting process (AG-CP) to explore the importance of accounting and financial ratios as well as industry effects that are useful in detecting potential insolvencies. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the literature on corporate default prediction is manifold and predominantly focused on U.S. data. Thus, academic contribution based on German-listed companies is limited. To our best knowledge, we are the first to conduct thorough comparative out-of-sample Cox regression models considering AG-CP based on a unique dataset for non-financial constitutes subject to the German insolvency statute (“InsO”). Relying on a parsimonious accounting-based approach inspired by Altman (1968) and Ohlson (1980) is merely adequate. Shumway (2001) and Campbell et al. (2008) variable selection delivers the best discriminatory power and calibration results. In particular, a combination of pure accounting ratios augmented with market-driven information in Model (2) indicates superior accuracy rates in top deciles. However, in-sample empirical results underpin the importance towards market-based indicators, as all accounting ratios enter statistically insignificant. Secondly, we test to what extend industry variables improve discriminatory power and forecasting accuracy of fitted models. Contrary to the findings of Chava & Jarrow (2004), our research implies that industry grouping adds marginal predictive power and no overall improvement in accuracy rates when market variables are already included in the probability of default (PD) model. © 2020 by the authors.

Lack of applied studies exists on retail product and service development aimed at harmonization of interests among all the parties involved in consumer lending system at the local level, in Russian developmental context. Meanwhile, housing affordability issue is one of increasing importance for Russian small towns and settlements, also relatively poor highlighted in existing research literature in terms of proposed measures to improve the local households’ living conditions. This research gap is addressed in the paper relying on an integrative framework, blending the elements of the project management theory, pragmatic institutional economics, and reasoned action approach. Conceptual model is proposed to illustrate the process of institutionalization of sustainable lending and borrowing principles within the local communities, which implies prevention of wasteful-spending credit practices and transformation of consumer loan products into the financial source of development. The household survey, accompanied by the interviews with the community leaders in small depressed Russian monotown, have supported the relevance of sustainable credit products development to address local households’ problems related to housing construction and renovation. The research findings have shown that Russian depressed mono-industrial towns are viewed as the testing areas for such pilot projects to be implement with the local authority’s genuine participation. © 2017 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

These reports provide rich information – qualitative and quantitative, of the non-financial activities, present the firms focus on SD and cater to the conflicting demands of stakeholders. This study analyses the sustainability reporting of the top 60 banks – 20 Indian, European and International banks to investigate the focus of their non-economic disclosure and analyse them through the theoretical lens of accounting disclosure theories – Legitimacy, Institutional, resource-dependency and stakeholder theory (Chen and Roberts, 2010) . Content Analysis of AR’s and SR’s was done with an initial list (119 words) culled out of literature (academic articles and practitioners reports) and pilot tested on 6 reports; words which did not have a match were dropped and a final list of 30 words was used for analysis. Results indicate that banks focus upon areas which cater to the immediate and elementary needs of the business eco-system like Energy; agriculture, wind and water. All these have a definite social consequence. Results find support in the resource-dependency and legitimacy theories.

Particularly the automation of judgment systems and systems that require human intervention, are deemed to be more relevant to confront a transformation through Robotic Process Automation (RPA). During the continuous development, the augmentation of such systems through Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a greenfield project with high expectations. However theoretical frameworks have not yet been elaborative and sufficient to capture how such deployments can be conducted. Addressing this research gap, this study presents a summarized overview of the transforming RPA ecosystem and indicates what challenges are critical to being confronted for a successful implementation of such systems in accounting and auditing. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper investigates the relationship between investor sentiments and energy price in an emerging market. Current literature deals with the impact of investor sentiments on energy prices however we have tried to investigate the reverse of it. This is because uncertainty in energy prices has major influence on investor confidence which affects their investment decisions in energy sector. Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) with its exponential form (E-GARCH) is used to investigate the impact of energy prices on investor sentiments. A sharp increase in investor sentiment index is observed in the first and third quarter of 2006 and 2009 respectively that might be attributed to an increase in economic growth. Results of the study show that energy prices have noticeable effect on investor sentiments in Pakistani equity market. This finding highlights the fact that even in an emerging market like Pakistan with least market efficiency, investors are sensitive to the global energy prices. © 2018 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

"Governing board attributes as profitability influencers under endogeneity: An econometric analysis in South Africa","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079681878&doi=10.35944%2fjofrp.2019.8.1.009&partnerID=40&md5=e9c78baf7d10589193420e6a1f7fb59d","Presently, the oversight role performed by the governing board has been interrogated due to the demise of several corporate giants. The governing board is responsible for advancing the strategic direction of the company by ensuring superior performance whilst managing risks. Accordingly, this study investigated whether the governing board has any influence on a firm’s profitability by using OLS and GMM estimation on an unbalanced panel of 130 firms over a six-year period. ROA served as a proxy for firm performance and several board-level governance variables were selected namely board size, board independence, CEO duality, director qualifications, and board interlocks. From an econometric contribution, this study found that the addition of instrument variables in the GMM estimation model has proven to be robust in examining corporate governance variables. GMM is also robust in controlling endogeneity and a possible bi-directional causality between board and profitability. From a theoretical contribution, agency, resource dependence and management hegemony theories are highly prevalent in the governing boards of the JSE. The results of this study are as envisaged in the SCP paradigm. All hypotheses were supported, showing overall that profitability is significantly influenced by the board attributes. This study provides a useful analysis of the theoretical framework used by academic writers as a foundation for model specification as well as contributes to the econometric methodology of corporate governance. These findings will also advise future researchers, stakeholders and regulators in better understanding the role of board composition from a profit maximisation and sustainability outlook. © 2019 by the authors.","Board interlocks; Corporate governance; IV GMM JSE; Managerial opportunism; Profitability; ROA",""

To evaluate this connection, we analyze the Indian stock market reaction to sudden changes in investors' mood captured by India's cricket results. By focusing on a rarely studied mood variable and a very infrequently studied stock exchange, this study adds to our understanding of the association between sporting event outcomes and mood. Research Objective/Questions: In this study, we investigate the impact of cricket wins and losses on the Bombay Stock Exchange. We hypothesize that cricket wins or losses will drive investors' mood substantially and unambiguously so that the game outcomes will be powerful enough to impact asset prices. We also evaluate the hypothesis that losses are psychologically more powerful than wins. Methodology: We analyze the daily data from the Bombay Stock Exchange using the methodology of Edmonds et al. (2007). This methodology has the advantages of capturing the Bombay Stock Exchange stock returns time-varying volatility through a GARCH model. Major Fundings: Our findings show that cricket wins and losses do not impact the Bombay Stock Exchange. On the exchange, stock prices reflect relevant information. Our results are thus consistent with the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Implication(s): Our results imply that on the Bombay Stock Exchange, cricket wins and losses cannot be reliably used by investors and portfolio managers to achieve returns in excess of the average market returns on a risk-adjusted basis. © 2019 ACRN Oxford Ltd.","ARCH; Bombay Stock Exchange; GARCH; Investor mood; Sentiment; Sports Sentiment",""

This article contributes by examining whether the quality of firms' internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR) is associated with managerial myopia. Research Objective/ Questions: The purpose of this study is to examine whether managers in firms reporting material internal control weaknesses (ICW) under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002 engage in myopic behaviors more than those in firms without reporting ICW. Methodology: The study uses the logit regression model to investigate a sample obtained from Compustat for the period of 2005-2013. Major Findings: The study finds a positive association between internal control weaknesses reported by auditors under Section 404 of the SOX and managerial short-termism which is measured by the probability of cutting R&D expenses in the current year from the previous year. Implications: Whereas prior studies mostly examine the impact of internal controls on accounting quality, this study demonstrates the implication of internal controls beyond financial reporting quality by showing an association between internal control quality and managerial myopia.

Compliance with higher Basel capital requirements (CAR) portends serious implication for distribution of loan portfolio across different sectors. The objective of the study is to examine African banks' responses to higher CAR in terms of portfolio shift. The study used descriptive statistics and ANOVA for panel data of African commercial banks that have implemented Basel II or III CAR for the period 2000 and 2018. Based on the results of our analysis, implementation of higher Basel CAR by African banks revealed four key findings. Firstly, our results suggest that higher Basel CAR particularly Basel III reduced total loans for South African banks. Secondly, African banks engage in portfolio shift with higher Basel levels. Thirdly, higher Basel capital increased banks' capital ratios in Africa, but some banks are still characterized by low equity. Fourthly, African banks reduce lending to high risk-weighted loans such as real estate and commercial loans except for South African banks which increased lending to commercial loans with higher Basel CAR. Lastly, this study proffers key insight into the lending behaviour of African banks with the implementation of higher Basel CAR. © 2021 ACRN Oxford Ltd..

Research Objectives: Therefore, the study aimed at exploring the causal correlation between the weighted average time deposit interest rates and the saving deposit interest rates along with the liquidity of Amman stock exchange as main proxies for investors' behaviour. Research Methodology: To achieve the aim of this research, the study employed empirical techniques like the ADF, Johansen co-integration test, VAR model and the short-run granger causality test to analyze a time series data covering the period Q1/2000-Q4/2016. Findings: Consequently, the study found that the tested variables became stationary only after converting them into the first difference. However, results from the Johansen test proved that the examined variables are not integrated on the long-run. Similarly, findings from the VAR analysis and the granger causality tests revealed that there is no short-run causality running from the volatility in interest rates towards the market's liquidity as captured by the value traded and the turnover ratio. Implications: Moreover, the study concludes that investors of Jordan can be classified as risk averse investors, since they are preferring to deposit their funds into the banks, though the level of interest rates is low. Eventually, the study recommends investors to rely on these rates to improve the quality of their investment decisions. © 2018 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

Methodology: In order to compare the results of both regression analysis and non-parametric tests, they were analyzed together. Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and Wilcoxon Rank tests were used for non-parametric tests. Major Findings: The analysis shows that average return of Day-2 is better than the other days. 12 sectoral indices display positively statistically significant results on that day.

Ownership structure plays an essential role in the company to determine the firm performance. The high concentration of family ownership has the power to reduce agency conflicts between management and stakeholders in a company. Concentrated ownership can serve as corporate governance mechanism for better and effective monitoring of management. This study was conducted to determine empirical evidence of the effect of political connections and family ownership structure on firm value. The sample in this study was 390 data of the manufacturing company. The data analysis used is moderating regression analysis. The results of this study are a positive influence of political connections and family ownership structure on firm value. The results showed that the more the company had a strong political connection and was controlled by the family, the more the firm value would increase. The interaction of political connections can strengthen the influence of family ownership on firm value. It proves that the family ownership structure plays a role in determining political connections in Indonesia, especially in manufacturing companies. The existence of empirical evidence that shows that the firm value controlled by a politically connected family is higher than companies that are not connected politically, which implies investors to invest in companies that are politically connected and companies controlled by families with majority ownership because it is proven to increase firm value.  © 2021 by the authors.","Controlling shareholder; Family ownership; Firm value; Political connection",""

This paper proposes a methodology that financial supervisors could follow to build 'late & sudden' transition scenarios that could be used as input into either traditional or climate-specific stress-tests of regulated entities. It also proses that supervisors run multiple simulations of these scenarios across regulated entities to inform on systemic and idiosyncratic 'impact tolerance' and creation of 'reverse stress-tests' enable the setting of minimum capital thresholds.

More specifically, we argue that if CSR investments provide value for firm's shareholders and stakeholders, they can also decrease firm's competitors' value (negative externality hypothesis). As a result, inefficient CEO compensation may arise even if CSR choice allows managers to act in the best interest of firm's shareholders and non-investing stakeholders. In sum, our new perspective indicates that excessive levels of CEO compensation are more than a principal-agent-stakeholder problem. In addition, our new theoretical argument suggests that voluntarily CSR should not be a relevant factor for achieving efficient levels of CEO compensation. © 2020 by the authors.

An emerging market-specific dollar risk factor can partly explain these momentum returns. We carry out permutation tests and find support for our hypothesis that momentum returns are driven by emerging markets. However, we show that transaction costs reduce momentum returns considerably. We also show that the returns are time-varying and have been unattractive recently. The implications of this study for financial practitioners are to focus on emerging market currencies and optimise transaction costs when executing momentum strategies. © 2023 ACRN Oxford Ltd..

This study is a conceptual paper through a literature review. The conceptual based on internalization of the value of Pancasila through historicity, rationality, and actuality. Historically, the SSF compliance model has not fully agreed with the values of Pancasila, which reflects the characteristics of taxpayers in Indonesia. Rationally, the SSF compliance model prioritizes the objective role of tax authorities in their primary task of collecting tax revenues. The reconstruction of the model through the actuality of the nation's ideological value occurs by balancing the role of the tax authority’s power with the taxpayers’ trust. The reconstruction propositions of the obedience model are based on humanist religious values at the conceptual level. The reconstruction of the SSF compliance model makes the humanist religious assumption the foundation of the tax authority's power as taxpayers’ trust increases. The reconstruction model is believed to be able to dynamically transform an antagonistic into a synergistic climate to increase voluntary compliance. © 2022 by the authors.

"Estimation of a firm’s optimal scale of operations and size-related analyses","2017","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047781362&partnerID=40&md5=382c2b6721528b8bdc8c57870c20829d","The paper proposes a framework that can be utilized for deciding upon the optimal scale of operations for a firm. The basic premise of the paper is that a firm that operates in a stable economic environment and a stable mode of business operations experiences a varying elasticity of scale that, after some scale level, becomes less than one and continues to decline with further increases in scale. A firm operating in such a stable system can search for its optimal scale of operations. The paper's premise does not refute the possibility that a firm can experience a shift from a lower elasticity of scale to a higher one; but this shift is not part of the mechanics of a stable system. Rather, it is due to some shock to the economic environment and/or the firm's mode of operations. Firms that operate under the assumption that they face a constant elasticity of scale, when in fact the elasticity varies, expose themselves to detrimental consequences. The model is in congruence with the Tobin's q criteria and can shed some light on why average q is a poor estimate for marginal q. The model sheds some light on the small-firm effect and on a major difference between internal and external growth. © 2017 ACRN Oxford Ltd.All Rights Reserved.","Elasticity of scale; External growth; Internal growth; Optimal scale; Small-firm effect; Tobin's q",""

While scientists call for stabilizing climate and regulators structure climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts around the globe, economists are concerned with finding proper and fair financing mechanisms. In an overlapping-generations framework, Sachs (2014) solves the climate change predicament that seems to pit today’s against future generations. Sachs (2014) proposes that the current generation mitigates climate change financed through bonds to remain financially as well off as without mitigation while improving environmental well-being of future generations through ensured climate stability. This intergenerational tax- and-transfer policy turns climate change mitigation into a Pareto improving strategy. Sachs’ (2014) discrete model is integrated in contemporary growth and resource theories. The following article analyzes how climate bonds can be phased in, in a model for a socially optimal solution and a laissez-faire economy. Optimal trajectories are derived partially analytically (e.g. by using the Pontryagin maximum principle to define the optimal equilibrium), partially data driven (e.g., by the use of modern big market data) and partially by using novel cutting-edge methods – e.g., nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), which solves complex dynamic optimization problems with different nonlinearities for infinite and finite decision horizons. NMPC will be programmed with terminal condition in order to determine appropriate numeric solutions converging to some optimal equilibria. The analysis tests if the climate change debt adjusted growth model stays within the bounds of a sustainable fiscal policy by employing NMPC, which solves complex dynamic systems with different nonlinearities. © 2017 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

We used the stochastic frontier of Battese and Coelli (1995) to measure the cost efficiency of both Islamic and conventional banks in the GCC countries during 2006-2015 (before the Arab revolution 2006-2010 and after the Arab revolution 2011-2015). Second, we used a logit model to discriminate between Islamic and conventional banks in terms of cost efficiency combined with credit risk, regulatory capital and interest margin. Third, we finally test the convergence and divergence between Islamic and Conventional banks by measuring the probability of having Islamic/conventional activities for both banks. We have shown that there is no absolute difference in terms of cost efficiency between Islamic and conventional banks. This difference can be observed through the credit risk taking but not through the interest rate margin. In addition, Islamic banks have taken advantage from the event of the Arab Spring revolution, compared to conventional ones, by being more efficient through risk mitigating due to their participatory financial product. Unlike previous research, we have used a cost efficiency measurement following Battese and Coelli's (1995) model and we have incorporated it in a logit model, in the context of crisis. Cost efficiency is combined with a set of prudential factors to determine their effect on the convergence/divergence between Islamic and conventional bank. © 2021 ACRN Oxford Ltd..

This paper examines the relation of the audit committee structure and the bank stability in the difference level of bank stability and the role of external audit quality in this relation by employing empirical techniques like 2SLS, S-GMM or quantile regression analysis with panel data, and using a sample of 37 commercial banks in Vietnam from 2002 to 2018. Our empirical results show that bank stability varies negatively with audit committee size, but this relationship is mitigated in banks that use good external audit services. Moreover, we also find that the relation of the audit committee structure and bank stability is heterogeneous, and that it is stronger in banks with higher stability levels. Based on these results, banks that have a large audit committee should consider a high quality external audit service and should increase the proportion of financial and accounting expertise in the audit committee in order to ensure bank stability. © 2019 by the authors.","Audit committee structure; Bank stability; External audit",""

This study uses moderating regression analysis (MRA) with the Robustness Least Squares with S-Estimation method. This study also conducted a sensitivity analysis with previous earnings management measurements (Kanagaretnam et al., 2010) and an additional test by comparing listed and non-listed banks on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The empirical results indicate that IFRS 7 disclosure weakens derivative instruments' negative effect and income diversification's positive effect on earnings management but does not provide a moderating effect on liquidity ratios. This study contributes to the bank management and Indonesian banks authority to provides another view of implementing IFRS 7 disclosure that have not been maximized in the Indonesian banking industry. In the future, the researchers expect the authorities to encourage all banks to disclose complete IFRS 7 disclosure to minimize information asymmetry. On the other hand, this study also contributes to the banking management to increase derivative instruments and to carry out more supervision on the provision of income diversification to minimize earnings management. Theoretically, this study contributes to the new earnings management measurement by applying more prudential principles based on the IFRS framework, IFRS 9 and Basel III regulations. © 2023 ACRN Oxford Ltd..

From the sampling set of 42 crowdfunding campaigns, I use the resulting discursive elements and tropes to identify feminist themes that drive the success of these campaigns through connecting with immanent societal values.

Previous research on this topic has provided mixed results. Some studies provide evidence consistent with the overpricing hypothesis, which indicates that DIVOP leads to overpricing because the market overweighs the most optimistic valuations, since optimistic investors can always buy a stock but pessimistic investors can only sell a stock if they already own it or need rely on short-selling, which has costs. Other studies support the underpricing hypothesis, which proposes that DIVOP works as a price risk factor that generates underpricing. We develop an empirical analysis that do not depend on the interpretation of abnormal future stock returns to assess contemporaneous mispricing. We use five explicit measures of mispricing. Also, to safeguard the development of a comprehensive study, we use three kinds of proxies of DIVOP, based on idiosyncratic volatility, dispersion in analysts' forecasts and unexpected trading volume. The results show a positive significant association between DIVOP and stock mispricing on a yearly basis. This association is stronger for underpriced stocks, which is consistent with the underpricing hypothesis, and indicates that DIVOP signals risk. An implication of this study is that firms have incentives to provide high-quality and explicit information to limit DIVOP and avoid being underpriced. © 2021 ACRN Oxford Ltd..

In an open log-value space, this distribution evolves from the initially normal to negatively skewed one. When payments are zero or proportional to the firm value, EMM turns into the Geometric Brownian model (GBM). We show that Modigliani-Miller Propositions (MMPs) and the no-arbitraging principle (NAP) result from the use of GBM with no payments. For a firm with payments, MMPs hold for short times and are false for time intervals exceeding a year. In contradiction with MMPs, the asset structure affects the firm value at the perfect market, and at the market with taxes, debt decreases the firm value even when there are no bankruptcy costs. NAP always holds for the entire market for short time deals. For long-term investments, the firm’s mean year returns decline in time intervals whose length depends on the firm’s initial conditions and its business environment. In these conditions, NAP does not hold for the whole market, but it temporarily holds for individual stocks as far as the mean year returns of the firms issuing them remain constant and fails when the mean year returns begin to decline. © 2020 by the authors.

To accomplish social goals, certain investors forgo part of the financial return. This approach opposes the concepts of conventional finance theory, which see the individual as a rational profit-maximizing decision-maker. A quantitative experimental study was conducted with students from the Upper Austria University of Applied Sciences, Steyr Campus, whereby the subjects were divided into two groups. A social Transaction Atmosphere (TA) was created in one group through the targeted use of stimuli. Subsequently, both groups had to make an investment decision in an identical scenario. The aim of the study and point of intersection between transaction cost theory and the social finance (SF)/impact investing (II) area is to analyse the observable ""irrationality"" in SF/II with reference to the transaction atmosphere as the primary decision-making element. The underlying scientific question investigates the impact of a socially shaped TA on the decision-making of investors. Experiment results demonstrated that the use of stimuli significantly raised the proportion of impact investments to overall investments. This finding suggests that a socially moulded TA is essential for investors' decision-making, whereby receptivity to the stimuli depends on individual investor characteristics, such as moral standard, financial knowledge, and previous experience with investment decisions. The financial aspect continues to play an important role in the decision-making process of investors. © 2022 ACRN Oxford Ltd..

This makes it possible to fund a wider variety of social and environmental initiatives, but also means that managing the challenges particular to impact investing become increasingly important. Research Objective/Questions - What happens after impact measurement? What challenges remain in the analysis of cost, risk, and joint impact-financial net returns that will be unique to impact investment portfolios? Methodology - Our conceptual view of portfolio management for impact portfolios focuses primarily on two difficulties at scale – subjective judgment and investor value heterogeneity. Major Findings - New tools capable of addressing value heterogeneity and subjectivity in decision-making are necessary to capture vital cost savings at scale and avoid limits on the impact that can be pursued. Regarding potential solutions, there is strategic opportunity in utilizing transparency, dialogic accounting, and democratic values in portfolio management. Implications - Existing tools could be adapted to the space to foster greater preference aggregation. To enable both market building and robust research, there is a need for additional transparency about current impact investment portfolio allocations and the decision-making processes that are used to set these allocations. © 2018 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

The use of relative wealth instead of absolute wealth to analyze risk should not be construed as an assumption that agents do not care about absolute wealth. Relative wealth is a perfect substitute for absolute wealth in the case of certainty and on a state-of-nature by state-of-nature basis; however, the use of relative wealth to assess risk over the spectrum of states-of-nature reflects a different outlook about risk. The resulting pricing kernel and asset pricing model are reasonably robust to changes in utility functions and returns’ distributions. The excess return of an asset depends on the covariance of its return with the return on the market portfolio and on all their higher co-moments as well. The simple gross risk-free return equals the harmonic mean of the probability distribution of simple gross market returns; an implication that does not bode well for financial markets in the current prolonged environment of low interest rates. It is straightforward to show that options on basic securities are priced using the same model. © 2017 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

An introduction to the history of economic cycles will lead to George Soros’ Theory of Reflexivity in order to draw inferences for the analysis of the role of information in creating economic booms and busts in the age of globalization. Empirically, based on a central European central bank’s GNP projections and backtesting corrections, a pattern of central bank corrections communication and economic market performance will be unraveled for the first time to outline that central bank market prediction corrections are positively correlated with near future market performances and negatively correlated with distant future market performances. The collective reality of prices and the irrationality of the crowds perturbating markets will be discussed. Business cycles are argued to obey some kind of natural complexity, as for being influenced by econo-historic communication trends. Recommendations how to create more stable economic systems by avoiding emergent risks in communicating market prospects more cautiously will be given in the discussion followed by a prospective future research outlook and conclusion. © 2019 by the authors.","Backtesting; BIP; Business cycles; Central bank communication; Corrections; Errors; Expectations; Forecasting corrections; Globalization Long boom; Gross National Product (GDP); Long downturn; Market performance; Price; Reflexivity",""

Economic historians vividly outline overaccumulation and overheating leading to a squeeze of profits as underlying to great booms, recessions and depressions by the historical examples of Italy, France, Germany and Japan. Overaccumulation is based on the capital account being run down due to a demand for labor, which leads to rising wages and capital flight and ultimately to unprofitable economies. Tightening labor markets during long boom phases lead eventually to class conflict, which is the starting point of the profit squeeze and eventually busts, recessions and depressions. This paper aims at adding to the existing literature the case of describing the Austrian Sozialpartnerschaft. This stakeholder engagement means practiced in Austria is shown to avert social imbalances leading to economically inefficient worker uprising, protests and strikes. The unique Austrian model of the voluntary Sozialpartnerschaft is captured to implicitly curb the falling rate of profit phenomenon. Rather than partially illegal and counterproductive, risky strike movements, the Sozialpartnerschaft forms an institutionalized relationship between the government, political parties and certain interest groups in the field of labor, social, and economic policy. While the influence of the Sozialpartnerschaft may be decreasing in the eye of the European Union integration and in times of globalization, other countries with fairly less developed stakeholder engagement approaches may learn from the positive example of the Austrian way to gracefully social partner in reaching common economic, industrial and societal endeavors together. © 2017 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

As a result, financial supervisory authorities are starting to explore how these risks can be integrated into existing stress-testing frameworks. This paper proposes a methodology that financial supervisors could follow to build ‘late & sudden’ transition scenarios that could be used as input into either traditional or climate-specific stress-tests of regulated entities. It also proses that supervisors run multiple simulations of these scenarios across regulated entities to inform on systemic and idiosyncratic ‘impact tolerance’ and creation of ‘reverse stress-tests’ enable the setting of minimum capital thresholds. An illustrative application of the process is shown, focusing on listed equity and corporate bonds tied to climate sensitive sectors (fossil fuels, power, steel, cement, automotive and aviation). © 2019 by the authors.","Climate stress-test; Climate transition risks; Minsky moment; Reverse stress-testing; Scenario analysis",""

The analysis of the simulated data shows mixed results, as the improvement of risk weight heterogeneity is restricted to optimistically valued portfolios. Conservatively valued portfolios are likely to be confronted with an RWD decrease. However, within these portfolios, risk weight heterogeneity usually does not play an important role. Out of all the analysed Basel IV rules, the output floor clearly has the biggest influence on risk weight density, while the effect of the input floors is very limited within optimistically valued portfolios and is even eliminated by the removal of the scaling factor within conservatively valued portfolios. The change in RWD will also lead to a concurrent change in risk-weighted assets and therefore also in the level of eligible capital. The findings within the retail portfolio confirm those of the EBA study, which already suggested that Basel IV and especially the output floor will lead to a significant increase of risk capital (European Banking Authority, 2018). © 2019 by the authors.","Bank regulation; Basel IV; Credit risk; Internal ratings based approach; Risk weighted assets; Risk weights",""

However, there exists no consensus on the integrated asset pricing framework among the financial economists in the contemporaneous asset pricing literature. Thus, we consider and study this research problem that has greater relevance in pricing the risks of an asset. In this backdrop, we develop an integrated equilibrium asset pricing model in an intertemporal (ICAPM) framework. Research Objective/Questions: Broadly we have two research objectives. First, we examine the joint dynamics of the human capital component and common factors in approximating the variation in asset return predictability. Second, we test whether the human capital component is the unaccounted and the sixth pricing factor of FF five-factor asset pricing model. Additionally, we assess the economic and statistical significance of the equilibrium six-factor asset pricing model. Methodology: The human capital component, market portfolio, size, value, profitability, and investment are the pricing factors of the equilibrium six-factor asset pricing model. We use Fama-French (FF) portfolios of 2 × 3, 5 × 5, 10 × 10 sorts, 2 × 4 × 4 sorts, and the Industry portfolios to examine the equilibrium six-factor asset pricing model. The Generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation is used to estimate the parameters of variant asset pricing models and Gibbons-Ross-Shanken test is employed to evaluate the performance of the variant asset pricing frameworks. Major Findings: Our approaches led to three conclusions. First, the GMM estimation result infers that the human capital component of the six-factor asset pricing model significantly priced the variation in excess return on FF portfolios of variant sorts and the Industry portfolios. Further, the sensitivity to human capital component priced separately in the presence of the market portfolios and the common factors. Second, the six-factor asset pricing model outperforms the CAPM, FF three-factor model, and FF five-factor model, which indicates that the human capital component is a significant pricing factor in asset return predictability. Third, we argue that the human capital component is the unaccounted asset pricing factor and equally the sixth-factor of the FF five-factor asset pricing model. The additional robustness test result confirms that the parameter estimation of the six-factor asset pricing model is robust to the alternative definitions of the human capital component. Implications: The empirical results and findings equally pose the more significant effects for the decision-making process of the rational investor, institutional managers, portfolio managers, and fund managers in formulating the better investment strategies, which can help in diversifying the aggregate risks. © 2019 ACRN Oxford Ltd.","Asset pricing; FF five-factor model; Human capital; Return predictability; Six-factor asset pricing model; Sixth factor",""

Such moral and ethical values are embedded in the monetary and financing relations to give the model of monetary reform necessary for an unstable financial economy.. The way to realize this goal is to refer to the Islamic epistemic foundation of unity of relations between the good things of life, while avoiding the un-recommended ones. Such good things are specified in this paper as money, spending, real economy resource mobilization along with their inner variables. All of these unitary relations are made possible by phasing out interest rate and thereby causing monetary resource to interrelate with real resources. Research Objective/Questions - The paper establishes the epistemic foundation of Islamic banks, well known these days to be productive and ethically performing financial institutions. This epistemic perspective takes the form of lowering the rate of interest; and thereby causing resource mobilization by complementing positively the monetary and financial resources with the real economy. Such an inter-causal relationship is shown to realize the objective criterion of wellbeing while also heightening the productive picture of the socio-economic system, which is the Islamic social economy in the absence of interest rate. Methodology - The methodology of the study is based on the pertinent Islamic worldview of unity of knowledge between the good things of life that are embedded in the dynamics of a learning inter-causal relationship. This methodological approach explains the imminent complementary nature of relationship between money, finance, and real economy of exchange in the ethically good and productive things of life while avoiding the unwanted ones. Major Findings - This paper is a rare one in the area of money, finance, and real economy inter-causal relations from the Islamic perspective of absence of interest. The paper thus becomes an analytical study for Islamic banks, central bank, and public and private sectors to formulate their thought and models along such imminent epistemic directions. Implications - The paper is of great relevance in the area of quantitative policy-theoretic study for that important part of the socio-economic system, which today is being financed by Islamic moral and productive instruments for monetary and financial reformation towards sustained stability. © 2018 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

Methodology: We propose to construct abnormal accruals as an endogenous variable, using the classic Kothari model (2005), in order to explain them by means of the “difference-in-difference” estimation approach (DID), understand the significance of the evolution of the manipulation, and explain these accruals using internal and external disciplinary factors. On the other hand, we use the credit risk portfolio manipulation theory advocated by Nessim (2003) and Repullo (2007), to understand the concept of actual venture capital of Tunisian banks after the Arab Revolution. MajorFindings: The results show that the situation of Tunisian banks has dramatically worsened since the Tunisian Revolution. The DID approach showed an exacerbation of abnormal accruals and a manipulation transfer from net income smoothing to credit portfolio value smoothing in order to reach a healthy financial situation. This aggravation is linked to the market discipline deterioration, the shareholders, the external auditors and the supervisory board. Implications: Before the Revolution, accounting manipulation was mainly caused by banking undercapitalization that led managers to offer more risky credit in a diluted ownership market and in an informational asymmetry situation characterized by the absence of the audit committee. After the Revolution, accounting manipulation resulted from an overcapitalization situation, which led managers to grant more risky credit. To circumvent the shareholders' supervisory power, managers manipulated credit portfolio values, offering a low level of credit risk, and circulating false beliefs for shareholders and depositors. This was done when prudential supervision was weak, leading to an information asymmetry and long-term conflict of interest between external auditors and managers through abnormal remuneration and a long relationship. © 2019 ACRN Oxford Ltd.","",""

One strand of the literature has focused on explaining the observed movement of the nominal or real exchange rate in terms of macroeconomic variables. Another strand of the literature has evaluated the behaviour of the real exchange rates in relation to the equilibrium exchange rate, which is the real exchange rate that is consistent with macroeconomic balances. Albania implements a free floating exchange rate regime; therefore, evaluating whether the actual real exchange rate is too strong or too weak compared with the real equilibrium exchanges rate has great relevance for the Albanian economy. Research Objective/Questions: Generally, the real exchange rate is defined as the nominal exchange rate adjusted for the relative price differential between domestic and foreign goods and services. So, an appreciation of the nominal exchange rate or higher inflation at home relative to other countries may lead to an appreciation of the real exchange rate. Such appreciation weakens the competitiveness of a country, widens the current account deficit and increases vulnerability to financial crises. The opposite holds true when the real exchange rate depreciates. The aim of this paper is, first, to estimate the equilibrium real exchange rate for the Albanian currency against the euro and, second, to assess the total exchange rate misalignment during the period of 2001Q1-2017Q1. Thus, the equilibrium real exchange rate is used as a benchmark for evaluating the misalignment of the actual real exchange rate. Methodology: This paper explores the determinants of the real exchange rate for Albania, during the period of 2001Q1-2017Q1, based on the stock-flow approach, the so-called Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate (BEER), which effectively employs reduced-form modelling of the exchange rate based on standard co-integration techniques. The stock of net foreign assets and productivity changes has been considered fundamental for the real exchange rate. We have used the Johansen co-integration technique to test the existence of long-run relationships between our main variables and to evaluate the path of the equilibrium real exchange rate based on vector error correction model (VECM) results. Then the analysis is completed by calculating the degree of misalignment as the difference between the actual real exchange rate and the equilibrium real exchange rate. Major Findings: Based on the Johansen co-integration approach, we find one long-run relationship between the real exchange rate of the Albanian lek against the euro, relative productivity and net foreign assets during the period of 2001Q1 to 2017Q1. The model implies that the real exchange rate is affected, as we expected, by relative productivity and net foreign assets, confirming that an increase in both variables leads to an appreciation of the real exchange rate in the long run. Our results show that the behaviour of the actual real exchange rate is similar to the path of the equilibrium exchange rate and that the degree of misalignment throughout the period is estimated to be moderate. Implications: Our empirical results confirm that the degree of misalignment is reasonable, suggesting a consistency between macroeconomic (especially monetary) policies and the free floating exchange rate regime. Assessing real exchange rate misalignment is a very important issue for policy makers because of the severe welfare and efficiency costs that such misalignment can have for an economy. © 2019 ACRN Oxford Ltd.","BEER; Co-integration analysis; Equilibrium exchange rate",""

Previous papers show mixed results on the relationship. To clarify the relationship, we consider dividend reputation. We investigate whether dividend reputation plays a role in explaining the relationship between dividend yields and stock returns. Research Objective/ Questions - We hypothesize that firms with dividend reputation tend to have less risk compared to firms without dividend reputation, and the expected return of firms with dividend reputation will be lower given the dividend yield, which is called the “reputation effect.” A mix of firms with and without dividend reputation in a sample could distort the relationship between stock returns and dividend yields. We group stocks according to reputation and analyze the relationship between dividend yields and stock returns. Methodology - We construct our sample from all firms listed on the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stock exchanges. In our analysis, reputation effects are included to analyze the relationship between dividend yields and stock returns. We divide our sample firms into three groups according to the track record of dividend payments to control for reputation effects: (1) reputation-established firms, (2) reputation-building initiation, and (3) no reputation firms. To test the hypotheses, we run the panel regression with reputation variables and the control variables. Major Findings - We find that the reputation effect is strongest for reputation-established firms and a weaker reputation effect for reputation-building younger firms. After controlling the reputation effect and other relevant variables, we find that there does exist a significantly positive relationship between dividend yields and stock returns. Implications - The empirical results show that the reputation effect is higher for established firms with a good track record of dividend payments than for firms with a short history of dividend payments or for firms with an unreliable history of dividend payments. After controlling the reputation effect and other relevant variables, we find there exists a significantly positive relationship between dividend yields and stock returns.

It is not an obstacle for the investor in predicting the future return with high accuracy when there is a minimum chance for the opportunity behavior. This causal research has developed a new variable to measure the investor's perception, and it is the future market value as a proxy for future return. The observation data used the samples on the listed company in the industrial manufacturing sector from 2015 until 2020, which amounted to 384 observations. The management's effort to deduct the manipulation activity can be interpreted as the minimum level of misleading information. When the investor has no tolerance for manipulation activity, the management should be ""prudent"" in designing the accounting treatment policy to illustrate real earnings. It is a sign of high probability in reaching out to the better prospect, proving the interactive feedback between management and investor through the Decision Tree Model and Bayes Theorem.

"The effect of access to debt on lebanese small and medium enterprises performance","2020","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082829343&doi=10.35944%2fjofrp.2020.9.1.003&partnerID=40&md5=70160c532a9191203f40c048211c3d5e","Since thirties access to debt has been considered as one of the main challenges facing the growth of Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, empirical studies focused on how facilitating access to debt affects SMEs financial performance in developed countries. However, this is not the case in the developing economies countries such as Lebanon due to the lack of financial transparency and poor financial reporting. In addition, very few studies discussed the theoretical pillar behind SMEs financial behavior on how access to debt affects firm performance in developed and developing countries. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate the effect of access to debt on Lebanese SMEs financial performance in terms of profitability and tangibility. In addition, the study explores the theoretical explanation of how Lebanese SMEs access to debt affects profitability (PR) and tangibility (ST) using trade-off theory (TOT) and pecking order theory (POT). Data of 102 SMEs for the period 2014 till 2017 from 12 official audit firms located in Beirut-Lebanon. Additionally, generalized least squares (GLS) method was used to conduct regression analysis. The analysis reveals the positive effect of Lebanese SMEs access to debt on SMEs profitability and tangibility confirming the adoption of trade-off theory as an approach by Lebanese SMEs and lenders. It is concluded that facilitating Lebanese SMEs access to debt to reach proper debt level improves SMEs performance which in return affects positively the lenders and economy as whole. © 2020 by the authors.

"Quantitative description of financial transactions and risks","2017","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047735980&partnerID=40&md5=1cc96ae862f2a6737373d893d083c63b","This paper presents a quantitative model of financial transactions between economic agents on economic space. Risk ratings of economic agents play role of their coordinates. Aggregate amounts of agent’s financial variables at point x define macro financial variables as functions of time and coordinates. Financial transactions between agents define evolution of agent’s financial variables. Aggregate amounts of financial transactions between agents at points x and y define macro financial transactions as functions of x and y. Macro transactions determine evolution of macro financial variables. To describe dynamics and interactions of macro transactions we derive hydrodynamic-like equations. Description of macro transactions permits model evolution of macro financial variables and hence develop dynamics and forecasts of macro finance. As example for simple model interactions between macro transactions we derive hydrodynamic-like equations and obtain wave equations for their perturbations. Waves of macro transactions induce waves of macro financial variables on economic space. Diversities of financial waves of macro transactions and macro financial variables on economic space in simple models uncover internal complexity of macro financial processes. Any developments of financial models and forecast should take into account financial wave processes and their influences. © 2017 ACRN Oxford Ltd.All Rights Reserved.","Economic Space; Macro Finance; Risk Ratings; Wave Equations",""
"The value of political independent supervisory boards: Evidence from Indonesian dual board setting","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107947203&doi=10.35944%2fjofrp.2021.10.1.008&partnerID=40&md5=a3e5ad1731fef9640729c23c777ca923","We investigate whether political independent supervisory boards (political I-SBs) help companies to reduce their corporate risks in the setting of Indonesian two-tier board system. This study is different from other studies in several ways. First, while most prior studies examine the effectiveness of independent boards in one-tier board setting, we use dual board system. This system promotes the strategic role of political I-SBs. Second, we use two measures of corporate risks: operating and market risks. Based on 1,176 firm-year observations for operating risk analysis and 1,254 firm-year observations for market risk analysis, we find that firms with political I-SBs have lower operating and market risks than firms with non-politically connected independent SBs. We also control for endogeneity problem using GMM (Generalized Method of Moments) method, and the results are still consistent. © 2021 by the authors.

"Beyond the three lines of defense: The five lines of defense model for financial institutions","2021","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107969774&doi=10.35944%2fjofrp.2021.10.1.006&partnerID=40&md5=b8a70e40bb6864dbd4ebe7b5101c9e81","The purpose of this study is to provide an updated version of the widely accepted three lines of defense model (3LoD) to better apply for regulated financial institutions. The author proposes the five lines of defense model (5LoD) which consists of the existing three lines along with external audit and regulators (comprising the fourth and fifth line of defense respectively). In spite of the fact that the bodies forming the two additional lines of defense constitute the external lines of defense, there should be active in supervising and monitoring control issues within the organization, in strong cooperation with the internal lines. This calls for closer interaction among the internal auditors, external auditors and regulators in the design and implementation of an efficient and effective internal control system, aiming to strengthen the existing framework regarding the governance of modern financial institutions, which operate in a highly demanding regulated environment. © 2021 ACRN Oxford Ltd..

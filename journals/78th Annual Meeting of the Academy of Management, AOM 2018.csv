The impact of bankruptcy on competitors' innovations,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054599224&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.26&partnerID=40&md5=b594335c974811dc16431dc456eb958a,"While prior studies have paid considerable attention to how competitors of the bankrupt firm are affected by stakeholders' negative perception, little is known about how bankruptcy influences competitors' innovation over time. In this study, we build on threat-rigidity theory to examine how competitors behavioral response to bankruptcy events leads to lower innovation performance. We also examine when the bankruptcy effect on competitors innovation is more/less pronounced. We study U.S. public firms between 1996 and 2000 and we employ differences-in-differences approach (DiD). We find that competitors innovation decreases in the post-bankruptcy period, as suggested by threat-rigidity theory. We also find that the negative effect of bankruptcy on innovations is more pronounced when competitors size is larger. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Role regeneration as a pathway to “powerless” category persistence,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054594731&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.88&partnerID=40&md5=7de6d63d248a166aa2476ecc10d9cb9f,"We explore how a category comprised of relatively powerless members and lacking centralized leadership persisted throughout decades of unprecedented disruptions. Drawing on interview and archival data we capture the responses of U.S.-based privately-owned travel agencies to industry deregulation, the emergence of online competition, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the cessation of airline ticket commissions. We find that during this time, category members individually altered their reliance on specific roles, in response to the needs of their immediate stakeholders and available technologies. Some historic roles were resurrected by agents who leveraged their longevity in the category, while others were adapted to the contemporary context. We find three mechanisms'leveraging longevity, tapping networks, and technology investing'that drove the collective regeneration of the category's roles, enabling its persistence. We contribute to theory by demonstrating how seemingly powerless actors shape category dynamics through unwitting agency, complementing an emphasis on strategic action. Through demonstrating how roles influence categorization, we also contribute to theory on the benefits to category ambiguity, and the role of social context in shaping categories. © 2018 Academy of Management.

In search of wellbeing: When is entrepreneurship the answer?,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054601113&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.76&partnerID=40&md5=e098a9d6185963ca660048b57156d435,"The decision to become an entrepreneur may be one adaptation strategy individuals enact when they experience low work-related wellbeing. To date we know that the interplay between work-related identification and work-related subjective wellbeing affects individuals work-related choices. However, we possess less knowledge about the nature of this relationship. Extant studies have linked work-related subjective wellbeing (SWB) to identification, yet conceptualization of work-related identification has, like SWB, typically been considered from a static state perspective rather than a dynamic process perspective. Further, researcher imposed definitions have been used rather than seeking individuals self-definitions. Our study seeks to complement existing work by showing that identification is a dynamic process where we explore the relationship between multiple identifications and wellbeing. We empirically investigate the interplaying processes of identification and work-related wellbeing in an in-depth, person-centered, life story approach to the entrepreneurial endeavor. Our sample was purposively selected to include individuals with a strong professional identification while enhancing the variability of challenges faced over time in the entrepreneurial identification process. Our novel sample and life story methodology contribute to illustrating the dynamics of wellbeing over time with a constant identification and dis-identification in moving between aspired and experienced wellbeing; as well as highlighting that wellbeing becomes the antecedent, means and result while entrepreneurship is the believed mechanism to come closer to experienced wellbeing. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The effect of two dimensions of CEO political ideology on corporate entrepreneurship,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054600663&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.39&partnerID=40&md5=d1c7d679c05275f7fbba6ce551684dc4,"We examine how two dimensions of CEOs' political ideologies' social and economic' each influences top management team (TMT) decision-making processes and in turn corporate entrepreneurship. We theorize that CEOs' social liberalism influences the amount and types of information used during TMT decision-making processes, while CEOs' fiscal liberalism influences the degree of cooperation occurred during TMT decision-making processes. We also hypothesize that these two ideology dimensions influence corporate entrepreneurship through TMT decision-making processes. We test our theory with a sample of 141 small and medium-sized Iranian firms. We find that TMTs with socially liberal CEOs tend to go through more extensive information search processes, which in turn is negatively related to corporate entrepreneurship, and that TMTs with fiscally liberal CEOs tend to go through more cooperative processes, which in turn is positively related to corporate entrepreneurship. This study re-conceptualizes executive political ideology by disentangling the distinct effects of social and economic dimensions of ideology and yields new theoretical insights on the implications of executive political ideologies for firm strategies and outcomes. In addition, through explicit examination of the mediating mechanisms, this study develops more precise theoretical explanations of how CEO political ideologies affect strategic behaviors. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The end is just the beginning: Turnover events and their impact across space and time,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054600146&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.188&partnerID=40&md5=51da71e4c2218ef5f45bfb279e55cc63,"Turnover is not only the ending of an employment relationship, it is also the potential beginning of another cycle of turnover. In fact, turnover events can increase, decrease, or have no effect on turnover cognitions and decisions of those that remain in the organization. Despite this, we know very little about what happens to organizational members after turnover events occur. To address this gap, we develop Turnover Event Theory (TET). TET is a multi-level theory that describes how turnover events activate individual and collective attention and the subsequent appraisal and deliberation processes arising from turnover events. By describing the psychological and social processes that follow a turnover event, TET provides a needed explanation of how a turnover event may facilitate or restrain downstream turnover events. We develop specific propositions to better understand this phenomenon and offer guidelines for future theoretical and empirical work. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The power of we: The effects of mutuality and team reflexivity on team resilience in the workplace,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054600412&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.59&partnerID=40&md5=09abe4a7a6441d957dfe59c6c872b20d,"In the light of grand challenges, scholars and practitioners interest in resilience in the workplace has increased over the last decade. So far, research has primarily focused on the individual level of resilience. Yet, considering the importance of teamwork for organizations, a better understanding of resilience as a collective level construct is highly needed. In this study, we aim to address this research gap and connect theory on resilience with theory on high-quality connections. Based on a quantitative, multi-informant study with 94 teams, we investigate the influence of mutuality, as one defining element of a high- quality connection, on team resilience and find a strong positive effect. Further, we uncover an important moderator of this relationship and show that the positive relation between mutuality and team resilience is contingent on the level to which teams engage in reflexivity, as a process of updating and questioning information. Finally, we show that mutuality indirectly fosters team performance through team resilience and that this indirect effect is conditional on team reflexivity. These findings hold important implications for theory on team resilience, theory on high-quality connections and, more generally, for the research stream of positive organizational scholarship. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The dynamic interplay of contracts and trust: Untangling between- and within-dyad effects,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054594068&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.107&partnerID=40&md5=b5d3a8b8fced05e1b79d2a97fc49182d,"This study untangles the complex contract'trust interplay by differentiating between- from within-dyad effects. When comparing buyer'supplier dyads, contracts and trust should complement each other, reflecting varying levels of exchange complexity and deliberate contracting efforts. But in within-dyad comparisons, contracts and trust substitute for each other over time, due to partner-specific learning and the emergence of routines. To validate these arguments, the authors examine boundary conditions at the exchange level, namely, exchange product customization and prior exchange history. Product customization reduces the complementary between-dyad effects of trust and contracts; exchange history makes the within-dyad substitution effects more salient. The results, based on survey data from 250 buyer'supplier relationships collected over two time periods, provide strong support for the propositions and thereby establish a more refined understanding of the dynamic contract'trust relationship. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Internal orientation in the growth of born-globals.

But those variables remain, in the literature, intimately tied to the figure of the entrepreneur, forgetting the key role played by the rest of the staff, and to the interaction of the BG with external forces. Based on a longitudinal case study in a young BG by means of action-research, that allows the participation of all employees in the co-creation of internal knowledge, we identify organisational dysfunctions during the early phase that affect the development of entrepreneurial and market orientation. Using the Socio-Economic Approach to Management (Savall, 1974), we propose that the entrepreneurs need to adopt an Internal Orientation (aiming at developing a cohesive organisation), and that the ‘right time’ for doing so is not after a few years, as the literature suggests, but much earlier. Finally, we introduce in BG studies the instrumental role of management consultancy in the sustainability of the international venture. © 2018 Academy of Management.

We present theoretical arguments implying that the strength of ties is more important for inventive quality, and the size of a network is more important for inventive quantity. We base our analysis on original survey data obtained from 1,204 inventors listed on European patent applications of companies active in clean technology, nanotechnology, and mechanical engineering. The survey data were matched with register information covering 15,168 patent applications filed at the European Patent Office. We find that the size of the network and the strength of the ties are positively related to invention quantity and quality. After instrumenting the endogenous network variables, we find that not considering endogeneity leads to an overestimation of the effect of the network size and an underestimation of the effect of the strength of the network ties. Additionally, after instrumenting the endogenous variables, we find that whereas the size of a network is equally important for invention quantity and quality, the strength of network ties is considerably more important (times 1.6) for quality than for quantity. © 2018 Academy of Management.

We study whether and how disclosure generates returns to the firm during standard setting. Departing from the convention of focusing on disclosed standard essential patents (SEPs), we examine the role of the firms non-disclosed complementary technologies in generating returns. Main results show that firms with more non-disclosed complementary technologies experience greater returns to stock prices over disclosure events, and these technologies gain more in value (indicated by patent citations) over disclosure, at rates higher than even that of the disclosed SEPs. Our findings suggest that, in these systems, a firm is using its larger technological portfolio to appropriate value from coordinating a smaller part of it with others via standard setting, and that a systemic view of the firms portfolio is important in understanding strategy within these systems. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Members of a crowdsourcing platform may form temporarily self-organized virtual teams to participate in a crowdsourcing tournament. Social dominance-based faultlines widely exist in these virtual teams. These faultlines result from the alignment of team member's social dominance related attributes (e.g., rank and tier) in the crowdsourcing platform and may spilt group into subgroups. Although inter-subgroup bias may disrupt team communication and collaboration, distinct knowledge and perspective from different subgroups are potential resource to group brainstorming and team coordination. Drawing on the Categorization- Elaboration Model (CEM), this study investigates the contingent effects of team intellectual capital and team feedback seeking tendency on the relationship between social dominance-based faultlines and team performance in the context of crowdsourcing tournament. We collected real objective data about 208 teams from one of the biggest crowdsourcing platforms, Kaggle.com.

Introducing the concept of network duplication'the extent to which two individuals are tied to the same functional groups inside an organization'this paper aims to build and test a theory of the division versus duplication of networks. It advances our understanding of second-order social capital and its role in the interpretation and influencing aspects of the innovation process by shedding light on how network duplication affects technologists' and managers' innovation performance. It finds that the merits of a division versus duplication-of- networks approach are contingent on the mutual interdependence of managers and technologists. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Further a multiple regression was performed to predict the level of satisfaction with life. Both adjustment and emotional support were statistically significant and they explained nearly 30% of the variability in participant's satisfaction with life. In relation to theory, this study contributes to the field of cross-cultural research and it helps to further explain expatriate spouses cross-cultural adaptation.

As such, family supportive supervisor behavior (FSSB) has been established as a key element contributing to employees' attitudes, well-being and behavior at work. Yet, employees and supervisors might not necessarily see eye to eye concerning FSSB. The main aim of this research is to explore the mechanisms and boundary conditions of how (mis)aligned perceptions of FSSBs relate to employees' intrinsic motivation and turnover intentions. Furthermore, we integrate the role of work-family culture and segmentation preference as boundary conditions in these associations. Using polynomial regression analyses, we analyzed a matched data set of supervisors and their subordinates, collected in El Salvador. In doing so, this study contributes to research on FSSB, by a) demonstrating the importance of employees and supervisors seeing eye to eye on FSSB as a driver of intrinsic motivation and retention, and b) delineating two boundary conditions for the effectiveness of FSSB. From a practical point of view, we show that FSSB interventions need to clearly set expectations and behavioral guidelines that are mutually perceived by both supervisors and subordinates. © 2018 Academy of Management.

(ii) the penalty is only present for entrepreneurs who fail quickly: entrepreneurs returning to the labour market after 5 or more years do not get penalized. (iii) entrepreneurs who fail fast and move to a new employer limit the wage penalty by changing industry compared to the industry they were venturing in.

To fill the gap, we examine the impacts of social media on the entrepreneurial process based on the effectuation framework. Using the data from 217 actual and potential entrepreneurs, this study shows that entrepreneurs’ attachment to social media is positively related to opportunity recognition, and such a relationship is negatively moderated by entrepreneurial passion. Our finding further reveals a positive association between opportunity recognition and pre-commitment seeking orientation. The positive relationship becomes stronger for individuals with higher entrepreneurial passion.

Drawing on matched employer-employee data from 387 organizations and 7,187 employees in 14 countries, the findings show a positive relationship between high-performance work systems (HPWS) and organizational performance across societal cultures. This relationship was not moderated by three dimensions of societal culture (power distance, in-group collectivism, and institutional collectivism) as proposed by contingency models of culture fit. However, further examination of three dimensions of human resource systems (skill-enhancing, motivation-enhancing, and opportunity-enhancing practices) revealed that opportunity-enhancing practices appear less effective in high power distance cultures. The findings provide general support for the universalistic ‘best practice’ perspective with regard to the positive relationship between HPWS and organizational performance, tempered by an appreciation of the limitations to opportunity-enhancing practices in high power distance cultures. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The restorative effect of work after unemployment: An intra-individual analysis of subjective well-being recovery through reemployment,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054597488&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.125&partnerID=40&md5=e434e9b264b5a26d22ba5e4af14540af,"A substantial body of research shows that unemployment has detrimental effects on individuals subjective well-being, which is consistent with the prediction of the theory of latent functions of employment. However, empirical research also shows that individuals generally fail to return to their baseline well-being even after exiting unemployment, a puzzle that runs counter to the latent functions theory. This study argues that the scarring effect uncovered by the previous literature is largely a statistical artefact resulting from the use of inadequate measures of baseline well-being and failure to distinguish those who follow different routes to exit unemployment. Applying fixed effect modelling to a UK longitudinal survey that followed approximately 10,000 individuals annually for eighteen years, this study shows that recovery of subjective well-being upon re-employment is fast, complete and enduring. By contrast, transitions into economic inactivity are accompanied by persistent scars on subsequent well-being trajectory. This study contributes to the literature by closing a hitherto unresolved gap in the explanatory power of latent function theory and similar work characteristics perspectives on the effects of re-employment. © 2018 Academy of Management.

However, a perennial tension lies in the simultaneous pursuit of administrative efficiency and other democratic values. We consider these tensions in the context of public procurement--an essential activity of government. Timely procurement processes by government facilitate the provision of public goods and services to the communities they serve. At the same time, government purchasing has large distributional consequences, and many governments have put procurement policies in place to achieve broader social objectives. Given the prominence of government procurement, there is remarkably little research examining factors that affect the performance of the procurement process. This paper builds a preliminary framework to examine how an organization's competing policy priorities, size and structure, and purchasing technology and infrastructure, affect the duration of time required for the approval of purchase requests. We analyze the data utilizing a unique set of survey data. Our analyses of a representative set of more than 200 local governments demonstrate that all three sets of variables in our framework can affect approval times, they do so in nuanced ways based on the types of purchases being made.

We examine the effects of individual pay transparency, a scarcely employed and much debated practice, on pay dispersion utilizing a unique governmental intervention that made tax records of all residents easily accessible through digital mass media in Norway. We test the operation of this intervention in the context of the entire population of individuals and firms in the years 2001-2012. We advance evidence that pay transparency significantly decreases pay dispersion and that the decrease varies, when employee mobility occurs, by the level of discrimination that each subgroup in the population experiences.

Don’t abandon the water cooler yet: Flexible work arrangements and the unique effect of face-to-face informal communication on idea generation and innovation,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054595902&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.205&partnerID=40&md5=a6a6fc9b6d65f3da8f01792e380ead1c,"While research has established the important role that flexibility plays in attracting, engaging, and retaining a diverse talent pool, it has provided less insight into its impact on team processes and outcomes, particularly on key dimensions of performance. Using data collected from 99 teams in a Fortune 500 organization, I investigate whether informal 'water cooler' communication is a uniquely important predictor of idea generation and, critically, whether teams in which members work more flexibly are at a greater risk of missing out on these types of interactions. I find that teams with greater location flexibility reported engaging less frequently in face-to-face spontaneous work-related communication, and to a lesser extent, face-to-face non-work-related communication. Moreover, I find that the type of communication most affected by team location flexibility'face-to- face spontaneous work-related communication'is also the type that has the greatest impact on team idea generation and, consequently, team innovation. Finally, I find evidence that teams were unable to effectively compensate for the loss of face-to-face informal communication by using electronic media, such as email, instant message, or audio/visual communication tools. Taken together, I shed light on the important question of whether'and how'flexible work arrangements impact team communication and innovation at a time when many organizations have begun to scale back on flexibility out of concerns about possible negative effects. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Results show that complexity has a direct negative effect on performance; however, more experienced facilities'specifically in terms of cumulative waste produced'are able to withstand the costs of complexity to improve operational performance. These results suggest that there are benefits to complexity when solving operational problems that may have long term benefits for firm adaptation. © 2018 Academy of Management.

When does discrimination increase predictive accuracy?

Building on judgment research, we develop a model that explains the mechanisms driving discrimination and describes situations in which discrimination is more likely to occur because decision makers benefit from increased predictive accuracy. Our work contextualizes existing statistical discrimination models, in which decision makers substitute group averages in the absence of reliable information about individual ability. We do so by incorporating two additional parameters into the decision making process: environmental uncertainty and decision maker inconsistency. We find that uncertainty severely dampens the benefits of discrimination and that inconsistency can overturn any benefit from discriminating (i.e., make discrimination costly). Our model implies that decision makers must acknowledge that discrimination is only beneficial under a very specific set of conditions and uncovers paths toward reducing the likelihood of discrimination occurring. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Our focus is to explore how polycentric governance emerges through mechanisms of collective action with businesses, public sector and societal actors. The empirical findings suggest that polycentric governance emerges to address challenges arising from information asymmetries and scale inefficiencies in insular systems with multiple independent governance units. It unfolds through processes of mutual adjustment and the building of mechanisms for collective agency, which lead to gradual hybridization. This leads to new, hybrid governance arrangements and more broadly-based ownership of resources. Our findings make important contributions to the literature on system-level governance for sustainability, hybrid organization, and the resource-based view of the firm. We conclude by discussing how the theory of polycentric governance can advance development of circular economy in systems composed of privately- owned resources. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The influence of witnessing competitors' winning CSR awards on focal firms' CSR intensity is stronger when the focal firms have high similarity with CSR award- winning firms. Our findings also show that CSR activities conducted by focal firms after witnessing competitors' winning CSR awards in the post- award period will give rise to higher performance compared with CSR activities by the same firms in the pre-award period.

Who contributes knowledge? Embeddedness and marginality in online communities,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054602076&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.35&partnerID=40&md5=c0f76e1ad674a88c7d5408800c560647,"This paper applies a multiple embeddedness perspective to better understand individual knowledge contribution in online communities. The community of practice and open innovation perspectives suggest different answers to the question: who is most likely to contribute knowledge in online communities? Viewed from a community of practice perspective, the most deeply embedded members of an online community are most likely to contribute knowledge. Conversely, from an open innovation perspective, solutions to local problems are more likely to be provided by peripheral participants from the margins contributors who are not embeddeded in the community. By extending the conceptualization of embeddedness to encompass not only social embeddedness, but also epistemic embeddedness, we resolve these conflicting predictions. Neither the community of practice nor the open innovation perspective individually explains knowledge contribution in online communities. Instead, using data regarding 88,472 participants at 51 Stack Exchange problem-solving online communities, we find that individuals who are socially embedded and epistemically marginal are more likely to make valuable knowledge contributions. We develop a novel approach to measuring epistemic embeddedness, using topic models, and also demonstrate that social embeddedness and epistemic marginality exhibit a considerable complementary interaction. © 2018 Academy of Management.

"Combinative capabilities, internal global sourcing and technology diversification in MNCs",2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054600175&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.139&partnerID=40&md5=42f97be21811b98aacce7d588bf7296e,"Although MNCs are in the best theoretical position to tap into and combine diverse technology that exists across their operations, extant research offers very little to help us understand technology diversification within MNCs. This paper explores how increased manufacturing capabilities and specialization in foreign operations contributes to technological diversification in MNCs that can lead to innovations that combine new technology domains from the local host country market with existing MNC technology domains. A unique dataset that combines comprehensive data on the worldwide operations of US MNCs from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) with data on the worldwide patents of these firms from the Derwent Worldwide Patent Index (DWPI), confirms that those foreign operations that provide more inputs and final products to parent and third country operations are significantly more likely to generate innovations that combine new technology domains with existing MNC technology domains. Overall, this paper explores how internal global sourcing activities can allow foreign operations to achieve a balance across a strong parent influence and local host country knowledge, which not only increases the technology diversity for the MNC, but also enhances the prominence, visibility and combinative capabilities of the foreign operation. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Careers in construction: Developing career identity out of redfining moments,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054591769&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.122&partnerID=40&md5=121454c412c3cd362e5f73d480fbc7c3,"More recent understandings of careers develop in sharp contrast to traditional approaches founded on linear trajectories carried out in singular organizations. The rise of dynamic careers, such as boundaryless, protean, and kaleidoscope, suggest that predictable life stages no longer capture careers that are experimented with across multiple organizations with self-driven, rather than organizationally driven, expectations that are heavily influenced by meaningful relationships across work and life roles. Yet, an identity perspective to careers suggests that in the face of redefining moments, both predictability to stabilize and experimentation to explore identity is needed to develop a coherent sense of self across diverse work experiences. Given the dynamic and often unstable nature of the employee employer relationships, our theorizing centers on this focal question: How do people both explore and stabilize a career identity when faced with re-defnining moments in their career? We answer this question by putting forth a typology of career construction processes for meaning making that guides, regulates, and sustains a career and posit these processes in a theoretical model of career identity development. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Legitimacy judgments about corporate tax avoidance: A deliberation experiment,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054589727&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.258&partnerID=40&md5=8711e2bdb5e9a5bcb619a0d0d8e8114f,"Previous research has suggested that business firms need to engage in active dialogues with stakeholders to maintain their legitimacy. We investigate this 'legitimation-as-deliberation' thesis in the context of global tax avoidance and explore whether and under what conditions deliberation leads to the legitimation or delegitimation of tax avoidance and the consultancies involved in facilitating tax avoidance. By conducting an experiment in which study participants discussed the issue of global tax avoidance with representatives of a tax accounting firm and/or representatives of an NGO critical of tax avoidance, we demonstrate that entering deliberations can indeed serve as legitimation strategy for firms. However, the direction and size of the effect depend on the relative persuasiveness of the representatives' arguments. Moreover, representatives of the tax accounting firm have a stronger impact on participants' legitimacy judgments about their organization, whereas representatives of the NGO mainly affect participants' legitimacy judgments regarding the practice. Our study provides three contributions to management research. Phenomenologically, it sheds light on tax avoidance as an important but underexplored topic in management research. Methodologically, it develops an experimental design enabling causal inference about deliberative effects. Finally, theoretically, it conceptualizes legitimacy as a communicative process of making judgments. © 2018 Academy of Management.

We are family!?

However, in all its heterogeneity, the family is often overlooked in family business research. Building on family science, social identity theory, and the current state of knowledge of ownership in family businesses, we argue that the owner family is a social group with membership criteria, and we characterize individual family members and their position in the owner family. We define the owner family as a social group based on family ties, (future) ownership and the interaction among individuals as well as the use of individual influence on the family. Included individuals consider themselves, and are perceived, to be part of the family and owners. In addition to this definition, we develop an owner family model and explore different types of owner family membership. We show that individuals can dynamically change their own position in the owner family over time and, in doing so, they can obtain more powerful positions in the family business. We conclude with a discussion of the effects of a concretely defined owner family on well-established family business research constructs and offer a future research agenda. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Being in love and at war with my team: Individual team ambivalence,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054590279&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.210&partnerID=40&md5=9d2ab1f66d6a6f698654a69bc0d92ea8,"In spite of the recent interest in affect as it influences teams and organizations, ambivalence as an affect-related team concept has been rarely studied. The seemingly incompatible coexistence of positive and negative feelings bears negative consequences to individuals, due to its uncertain and conflicting nature. Taking this to the team context, I introduce individual team ambivalence, which I define as a psychological state of tension and conflict in which strong positive and negative feelings toward a team exist in the same individual at the same time. In order to shed light on the origins and consequences of team members’ ambivalence about the team as a whole, I have developed a conceptual model of individual team ambivalence. The results of a study with 22 teams in a construction company show that individuals’ perceptions of team psychological safety foster individual team ambivalence through two different configurations of individuals’ positive and negative ties with other team members: within-tie and between-tie incongruence. In addition, my data indicates that individual team ambivalence negatively affects team members’ individual performance through the mediation of team commitment. © 2018 Academy of Management.

We differentiate an intangibility gap (difference in intangible asset levels) from a productivity gap (difference in productivity levels) and contrast their effects. We argue that productivity gap has a U-shaped effect, whereas intangibility gap has an inverted U-shaped influence on the internal R&D intensity of local firms. Moreover, we introduce the export intensity of local firms as a boundary condition under which the proposed relationships become attenuated. Using a sample of manufacturing firms in China, we find evidence that supports most of our predictions. © 2018 Academy of Management.

One explanation for these findings are negative stereotypes towards women, in general, and towards mothers, in particular. In the present research, we combine social role theory and spillover theory to argue that supervisors should benefit from their parental role by receiving higher ratings of leader-member exchange (LMX) quality. We further hypothesize that mainly fathers should benefit from this effect. We test these assumptions in an online experiment (N = 207) and in a field study (N = 443). We find only mixed support for our assumptions. Most of all, women were not devalued because of their parental role. As we also found only partial support for the spillover assumption, we tested a potential indirect effect of supervisors' parental status on follower-rated LMX via supervisors' work-family supportive behavior in a third study (N = 88), which was supported. We discuss the relevance of these results for both research and practice. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The impact of affective commitment on daughters’ succession intentions in family firms: The role of family firm ownership structure and in-group collectivism,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054597426&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.223&partnerID=40&md5=31a0016da7d606f97ef459d48be74f3d,"Succession is one of the most heavily investigated topics in family business research, and significant work has focused on understanding the drivers of the intra-family succession. However, less work has looked specifically at the succession intentions of women, or more specifically, daughters. Drawing on theory from psychology and concepts around affective commitment, we explore two determinates of intra-family succession, the affective commitment of the female successor and the country-level cultural environment in which the daughter and her family are embedded. Using data from the 2013 Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students Survey (GUESSS) of 6,249 female students from 18 countries, our findings suggest that affective commitment plays a critical role in intra-family succession for women, and that in-group collectivism positively moderates that role depending on how the ownership of the family firm is distributed among parents. In addition, the way that the country-level culture amplifies this relationship is stronger for women potential successors than for men. Implications are discussed. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Approaching gain or avoiding loss?

Thus, this study specifically examines the effects of CEO's regulatory focus (promotion vs. prevention) on CSR. Given that CSR is an outcome-uncertain investment requiring risk taking, we propose that CEOs with promotion focus are more likely to engage in CSR, whereas CEOs with prevention focus are less likely to engage in CSR. We further propose that such relationships will be stronger in conditions of high dynamism, under which any corporate investment could result in either big gains or big losses. Using a panel sample of U.S. firms for the years 2005 to 2011, we found that CEOs with promotion focus are more active in CSR engagement when there are high levels of industry- and firm-level dynamism. However, we did not find any moderating effects of dynamism on a CEO's prevention focus and CSR. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Scholars have theorized how the aesthetics of technology products shift over the course of the technology lifecycle. These scholars posit that there is limited aesthetic innovation during the era of ferment, but that producers engage in aesthetic innovation when the technology matures to differentiate their products in the market. We extend this theory through an inductive examination of technological and aesthetic innovations in the hearing aid industry over the 70-year period 1945-2015. We identify that each technology lifecycle is associated with a dominant aesthetic'that is an aesthetic manifestation, which is present in the majority of products during that lifecycle. In contrast to existing theory we show that the shift between dominant aesthetics occurs during the era of ferment. We find that categorical aspirations'aiming for the product to take on the meaning of other product categories'are a core driver of aesthetic innovation. Over the course of the technology lifecycle producers become dissatisfied with their products' aesthetic manifestations and they begin to draw analogies to other product categories. These new categorical aspirations do not spur new aesthetic manifestations'they remain latent. However, when a technological discontinuity jolts the existing dominant aesthetic it frees up producers to experiment with the accumulated latent categorical aspirations. After a period of aesthetic experimentation, the industry settles into a new dominant aesthetic, which undergoes minor aesthetic elaborations as the technology matures. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The present paper reports two studies that address this overall question. Study 1 (N = 243) demonstrated that (a) IER was negatively related to performance on objective tests, and (b) IER was related to survey measures depending on the means of these measures. As a result, IER could inflate an objective test’s associations with other object tests and survey measures. Using simulations, Study 2 examined the impact of two IER parameters – within-person consistency of IER and proportion of IER in the sample. When predicting the confounding effects of IER, within-person consistency had positive linear and quadratic effects, proportion of IER cases had a positive linear effect, and consistency and proportion had a positive interactive effect. In contrast, when predicting the attenuating effects of IER, consistency and proportion each had linear effect while their interactive effect strengthened each other. © 2018 Academy of Management.

This paper identifies external factors and internal strategic choices as sources of supply risks based on secondary data. Their effects are investigated over time and between firms. To this end, a hybrid regression model is estimated that captures time- and firm-effects in a single empirical model. The results suggest that external factors indeed heavily contribute to supply risk.

How do followers see their leaders and does it matter?: Insights from a person-centered analysis,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054595935&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.235&partnerID=40&md5=54f31cfe8c95cd3691cb34d6fa7f2a8b,"In response to calls for theory integration and more in-depth analysis of destructive forms of leadership, pattern-centered analyses have emerged that suggest optimal and sub-optimal profiles. We broaden the range of leadership behaviors traditionally included in this type of analysis by including abusive supervision. We use a pattern-oriented approach to validate theoretically meaningful profiles based on the full-range model of leadership and abusive supervision using a sample of full-time employee’s perceptions of their managers. Three theoretically meaningful leadership profiles were established: optimal, passive-dominant and abusive passive dominant (Study 1). Furthermore, we used conservation of resources theory to examine how followers’ personal (i.e., physical health and psychological well-being) and work-related (i.e., burnout and affective organizational commitment) outcomes were associated with each profile on a separate sample (Study 2). As expected, optimal leadership profiles were significantly related to positive personal and work-related outcomes for employees; however, passive-dominant and passive-abusive dominant profiles were both significantly related to negative employee outcomes. Interestingly, the passive-abusive dominant profiles did not have significantly worse outcomes than the passive-dominant profile. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Further work is therefore needed in this area. This essay provides the first exploratory study of implicit ethical behaviour and integral emotion responses in the asset management industry, through critical incident interviews with 38 elite fund managers in top-tier and boutique asset management companies in the UK. The latent thematic analysis of the interviews, guided by an essentialist paradigm, contributes to a contextualised elaboration of theory. First, it documents how elite fund managers respond cognitively and emotionally to their challenging investment experiences. That is, it identifies the dimensions of ethical behaviour (i.e., authenticity and responsibility) and emotion responses (i.e., control and motivation). Second, it unearths the extent to which emotion responses support the dimensions of ethical behaviour of elite fund managers. Third, it contributes to the literature on ethical theories/value orientation, emotion regulation and appraisal theories by highlighting congruencies and incongruences with existing research. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Theoretically, it draws on three main streams of literature: that on HRM systems as meaning-creating devices to govern the employment relationship, that on the relations between popular culture and organizations and the growing stream of visual organizational research. In addition, it elaborates on Eco’s semiotic theory to decipher the “mystery” represented by the mostly negative reactions of employees and unions to the managerial initiative. On the basis of the available empirical material, semiological guerrilla warfare (Eco, 1984) is advanced as a collective strategy to resist organizations’ internal mass communications.

A sample of 546 elementary school teachers completed a baseline survey assessing predictors, and a weekly diary on ICT demands and strain for five weeks. The multilevel modeling results suggest that weekly ICT demands constitute a source of significant stress, increasing the likelihood that teachers experience strain, including negative rumination, negative affect, and insomnia. Furthermore, teachers who adopted a technological boundary tactic of work-home integration (i.e., getting work email alerts on mobile phone) or had high internal pressure to quickly respond to ICT messages (i.e., telepressure) were more likely to experience ICT demands than those who did not. As hypothesized, students' parents' after-work communication expectations predicted more ICT demands. Teachers' work-home boundary control buffered the stressor-strain relationship between ICT demands and negative rumination. Additionally, students' parents' after-hours communication expectations strengthened the stressor-strain relationship through decreasing boundary control, whereas principals' work-family support weakened this relationship through increasing boundary control.

Not only a matter of dynamic managerial capabilities: Making more of corporate resources in dynamic environments,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054570127&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.183&partnerID=40&md5=3c6a3fce3dcda26416b6fc756e656d00,"In recent years, the interplay of managers and resources, and their combined influence on organizational performance, have received considerable attention in management research. Surprisingly, empirical evidence within a corporate setting remains scarce. Building on the Dynamic Capabilities View, and the foundations of the Resource-based View, we take a configurational approach, and find that the degree of a resource's fungibility alters the options and flexibility of managerial actions; depending on how fungible they are, corporate productive resources can either support or hinder dynamic managerial capabilities from materializing into firm performance. A dynamic fixed-effects model shows that highly fungible cash resources improve the relationship between dynamic managerial capabilities and the firm's performance, whereas less-fungible human resources make that relationship worse. Similarly, bundles of abundant financial resources and constrained human resources enhance the value-creation potential of dynamic managerial capabilities. Additionally, we find that a dynamic environment is a positive combinative element for the synergistic interplay of dynamic managerial capabilities and resources, but only in the case of highly fungible resources. In conclusion, our study calls for a more holistic assessment of dynamic managerial capabilities by accounting both for a firm's resources and the market environment. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The analysis advances team conflict research by offering a novel conceptualization of team conflict, one that complements the prevalent focus on conflict content. Moreover, by introducing the concept of team voice as a regulatory mechanism underlying productive conflict process, the analysis challenges some fundamental assumptions of how conflicts are productively solved. The essence of this idea being that it is not conflict, argument, or negative affect that destroys a team, but rather the absence of positive conversations. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Its diffusion around the world, however, is taking place at different speeds across countries. In this article we explore how national culture can help to explain this irregular diffusion. Our contention is that the adoption of ISO 14001 depends on two cultural dimensions, namely, performance orientation and institutional collectivism. Managers in performance-oriented societies decide whether to adopt ISO 14001 depending on its capability to attain material outcomes. Managers in societies with a high level of institutional collectivism, in turn, decide about ISO 14001 adoption based on its capability to signal environmental commitment. Our results confirm the influence of these cultural dimensions on the diffusion of the environmental standard. We also find that, as the ISO 14001 standard matured, the effect of performance orientation on its diffusion rate decreased. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Occasions for sensemaking and responses to change: A quasi-field experiment,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054588724&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.148&partnerID=40&md5=20dae1bda2fcd0b43adea32281dc5051,"One of the urgent questions in micro change research is how to better understand shifts in peoples' responses to change over time. Grounded in dual process theories of cognition, sensemaking research, and dialogical communication, we conceptualize occasions for sensemaking (OfS) as interventions facilitating shifts towards supportive responses. OfS are characterized by the initiation of (a) active cognitive processing, (b) interpersonal communication, and (c) conversations of understanding and performance. Based on two-wave data (N=145) comparing a treatment and control group, we tested OfS in a quasi- field experiment during a planned change in a technology firm. Latent-change score analysis showed that participating in OfS corresponds to a positive shift in perceived progress and intentions of change support, but not in pleasant affect towards the change. Further, we identify perceived meaning and impact of the change as two pathways explaining the effects of OfS. Our study contributes to the literature on temporal shifts in response to change and aims to motivate quasi-experiments on real interventions. © 2018 Academy of Management.

How coopetition affects knowledge recombinant capabilities: Toward a network perspective,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054589418&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.96&partnerID=40&md5=a2fe787084a2540439e924411639b4d4,"Focusing on the direct ties between coopetitors (i.e., direct coopetition network), the extant coopetition research ignores the potential impact of a firms indirect connections with other competitors from the same industry via its coopetitors (i.e., indirect coopetition network). We advance coopetition research by comparing the impacts of direct and indirect coopetition networks on a focal firms knowledge recombinant capabilities. Moreover, we consider how these impacts are contingent on the structures of a focal firms internal collaboration network (CN) and internal technology network (TN). By using a large-scale panel data set from the global solar photovoltaic industry between 1995 and 2015, we find that the size of direct coopetition network has an inverted-U shaped relationship with knowledge recombinant capabilities, while the size of indirect coopetition network negative influences recombinant capabilities. We further find that, when a firms internal CN small-world quotient increases, the inverted U-shaped relationship between direct coopetition network and knowledge recombinant capabilities is flattening and the turning point moves to the right; and the relationship between indirect coopetition network and knowledge recombinant capabilities becomes less negative. Interestingly, a firms internal TN small-world quotient exerts the opposite moderating effects on the inverted U-shaped relationship between direct coopetition network and knowledge recombinant capabilities, making it steepening and the tuning point moves to the left. Together, these findings contribute to a network perspective on coopetition that acknowledges the impacts of both direct and indirect coopetitors and their interaction with internal network structures. © 2018 Academy of Management.

To address this, I examine organizations that engage in venture philanthropy and analyze how their legal forms and entrepreneurial orientation (EO) directly and interactively affect their experience with traditional philanthropy (TP) logic and venture capitalism (VC) logic. Analyses of seven cases offer an integrative framework for understanding four experience types: logics complementing (nonprofit and a high level of EO), logics contesting (nonprofit and a low level of EO), logics coexisting (for-profit and a high level of EO), and logics isolating (for-profit and a low level of EO). EO reshapes nonprofits' cognitive views toward institutional constraints, enabling them to effectively integrate TP and VC elements into new hybrid models and become blended hybrids. Findings of this article also suggest that the role of EO is more significant for blended hybrids than segmented/segregated hybrids. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Born to take risk?

Despite this interest, scholars have little understanding of the impact birth order has on CEOs and their strategic decisions. With this in mind, we develop theory that explains how CEO birth order may be associated with strategic risk taking. Drawing from evolutionary theory arguments related to birth order, we theorize that CEO birth order is positively associated with strategic risk taking; that is, earlier born CEOs will take less risk than later-born CEOs. As evolutionary theory proposes that birth order effects are driven by sibling rivalry, we also argue that this relationship is moderated by three factors related to sibling rivalry: age gap between a CEO and the closest born sibling, CEO age, and the presence of a sibling executive in the same firm. Our results provide support for our theorizing and suggest that birth order may have important implications for organizations. We believe this study helps advance strategic management research, the broader multi-disciplinary 'family science' literature, and the much needed cross-pollination of ideas between the two. © 2018 Academy of Management.

In this paper, we address that opportunity by focusing on design thinking, a promising innovation methodology that marries a human-centered focus with iterative prototyping and testing. Design thinking has been much discussed in the private sector and in international government circles, yet its use in the U.S. federal government has been both less prominent and less explored by scholars. Though U.S. federal agencies report anecdotal success at a project level, empirical research examining the demonstrated impact of the approach is not yet available. To address this, a partnership between a university and a not-for-profit operator of federally funded research and development centers was formed to conduct a preliminary study on the use of the method, the results of which are presented here. Based on interviews with a cross-section of government design thinking practitioners representing a diverse set of federal offices, the study identified the specific contexts in which design thinking has been applied, the outcomes experienced by its practitioners, and the enablers and barriers to implementation they described. We conclude with recommendations for future research and practice, aimed at helping the government confront the challenges of the 21st century, and in doing so, improving the lives of its citizens. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Specifically, I discuss the experience of upward mobility and how it may result in identity conflict at work as individuals navigate a new social class context, considering discrete emotions (envy and shame) as the determining mechanism for the methods upwardly mobile individuals may engage in to mitigate the conflict experienced between social class identities. Endorsed meritocracy is discussed as a contextual variable in that when individuals more strongly endorse a meritocratic worldview, shame rather than envy is the more likely emotional response, thus resulting in differing types of identity work, called long-term class work (LTCW). Finally, LTCW success is discussed as a feedback loop in that when the individual experiences success, the identity conflict is likely to be reduced. Theoretical contributions, practical implications, and future research directions are discussed. © 2018 Academy of Management.

In this paper, we examine a heretofore ignored consequence of rising vertical income inequality within organizations. Specifically, building on theories of the psychology of social distance and power, we argue that high levels of vertical income inequality within firms result in poor employment relations such as executives willing to engage in mass layoffs. Further, we present findings from two studies that support this contention. In an archival study of public US corporations, we show that firms with high levels of vertical income inequality employ strategies such as layoffs. Consistently, in a laboratory experiment, we demonstrate that participants who are assigned to executive roles in a simulation and happen to experience high levels of organizational income inequality are more likely to layoff employees to meet quarterly goals. We discuss the implications of our findings for management theory and practice. © 2018 Academy of Management.

These evolutions call for a revision of our understanding of authority and for more profound considerations of the way it is concretely achieved in both fluid and fragmented contexts. Building on a six-month autoethnography of a consulting assignment, we show that authority is a practical, relational and situated performance. It exists in a tension between two mirroring processes, activation and passivation, by which relations are backgrounded or foregrounded to shape the situation and steer collective action. Our study also reveals that the performance of authority involves people, but also a broader range of actants, including artifacts and abstract entities. In line with current research on performativity and relationality in organizations, our findings contribute to the de-substantializing of authority and the revelation of its sociomaterial dimension. Thus, the following provides an action-based understanding of authority that is better suited for the study of post-bureaucratic organizing. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Serving to help and helping to serve: Employee reactions to HR manager servant leadership,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054588562&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.113&partnerID=40&md5=4ddb312134ef6682c0a8e98b19719068,"Research on human resource management (HRM) has long aspired to understand how HR managers could facilitate positive employee outcomes in their organizations. Existing studies typically suggest that the HR function could exert more influence by gaining a higher status and more formal authority in the organization. This study provides a new perspective to HRM research by examining how HR managers can bring about positive employee outcomes through servant leadership. Drawing on servant leadership and social learning theories, we develop a model that explores how HR manager servant leadership gives an impetus to a cross-level process that improves employee job attitudes. Using nested data from 667 grocery store managers, 121 line managers, and 23 HR managers, we find that HR manager servant leadership positively influences organizational members' overall justice perception through line manager servant leadership. Perceived overall justice, in turn, enhances employees' organizational commitment and job satisfaction. Results also indicate that high leadership self-efficacy augments a line manager's effectiveness to emulate servant leadership behaviors from HR managers and use these behaviors to advance positive justice perceptions among his or her followers. © 2018 Academy of Management.

What do we evaluate when we evaluate creativity: Revisiting the conceptualization of creativity,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054586782&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.202&partnerID=40&md5=3df93b17a3cd3d26f1af6358e74a8857,"Creativity evaluation is a theoretically interesting and practically important topic. In the current creativity research, the dominant approach to the study of this topic posits that people are looking for novelty and usefulness when evaluating creativity. This two dimensional evaluation scheme is a direct application of the conventional conceptualization of creativity as the generation of ideas or products that are both novel and useful. However, this approach has limitations in both conceptual clarity and empirical rigor. In this paper, we discussed the issues with the “novelty and usefulness” evaluation scheme and examined how well it accounted for judgments of creativity empirically. More importantly, we proposed an alternative approach to investigating creativity evaluation with a process- oriented conceptualization of creativity: creativity as a process of perspective- change. Two studies were conducted to provide initial evidence in support of our view. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Balancing professional prototypes increases the valuation of women in male-dominated professions,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054585450&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.200&partnerID=40&md5=c001a1562e7c40cad3f183d46e4bf785,"We tackle the persistent problem of people from specific demographic groups (e.g., women) being undervalued in professional contexts where stereotypes about their group do not align with the traits perceived to be essential for success (the professional prototype). We introduce “prototype inversion;” a novel, theoretically-derived strategy for changing prototypes such that group membership is irrelevant to determining an individual’s prototypicality. Prototype inversion emphasizes the importance of the valued professional traits typically associated with an underrepresented group, without dismissing those that are associated with the existing prototypical group. Thus, it becomes easier to recognize the professional potential of members of underrepresented groups, without incurring backlash from the already prototypical group. We conducted a full-cycle research project to demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy in the extreme context of women in firefighting. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Moreover, we introduce collective positive affect as an underlying mechanism linking diversity climate to organizational performance. Hypotheses were tested with a multisource dataset compromising 84 German small to medium-sized companies with a total of 15,310 surveyed employees.

Is social responsibility really “corporate”?

In an attempt to reconcile the seemingly disparate findings this study argues that the family beyond the firm may have been an important omitted factor in our understanding of firm heterogeneity in the corporate social responsibility (CSR) context. The paper draws on socioemotional wealth perspective to concurrently look at the business and family domains and argue that the family-centered non-economic considerations influence family owners’ decisions not only within the family firm, but also beyond its boundaries. Using a unique panel dataset of large US firms, we found that the private social activities of family owners in the form of family foundations are negatively associated with firm CSR compared to non-family firms. Moreover, we tested and confirmed that the substitution effect between the presence of a family foundation and CSR at the firm level holds only for first-generation family firms and those in which the level of family identification with the firm is low. By integrating the family level to understand firm level outcomes the study offers an initial step to capture the totality of family firm phenomena. © 2018 Academy of Management.

In this study, we aim to examine why and when supervisors' perceived job insecurity results in their abusive supervision. Adopting the stress perspectives on job insecurity and aggression, we posit that job insecurity evokes workplace anxiety, which in turn leads to abusive supervision. Further, drawing on the victim precipitation theory, we argue that the positive relationship between workplace anxiety and abusive supervision is stronger when subordinate performance is low. A three-wave study of 172 supervisor-subordinate dyads supports our model. We discuss the implications for scholars of job insecurity and abusive supervision, and for practitioners to prevent the occurrence and detriments of job insecurity. © 2018 Academy of Management.

However, existing approaches reveal some inconsistencies that need to be overcome in order to unfold the full potential of the method. First, while previous approaches refer to a version of realism that is problematic as it either overlaps with notions of interpretivism or positivism, a purely constructivist perspective of knowledge synthesis is entirely absent in the literature. Second, most previous qualitative meta-studies have drawn primarily on variance instead of process approaches to synthesize existing findings which is surprising as understanding processes is a key focus in qualitative research. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to present two very different approaches for conducting a qualitative meta-analysis that are informed by two opposing philosophical positions. These are, as we suggest, a realist and a constructivist research design of a qualitative meta-analysis. We illustrate these two approaches in the context of process theorizing. As a result, we show how both approaches differ in synthesizing qualitative evidence, show what kind of outcomes they generate, and finally discuss different quality criteria to evaluate both types of meta-analyses. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Although many empirical studies offer findings that support the industry lifecycle model's key assertions, other studies have challenged them and identified irregularities. I argue that these irregularities are caused by the lack of focus on the entire innovation ecosystem, and assuming that most industries only experience one lifecycle. In this paper, I build on the industry evolution and the innovation ecosystem literature and use both qualitative and quantitative research methods to examine the evolution of the satellite industry from 1957 to 2015. Results show that each actor in the innovation ecosystem provides unique yet interdependent values in the evolution of the satellite industry. In addition, the importance of each actor in the innovation ecosystem changes from the first to the second industry life cycle. Results of this paper begin to extend the industry evolution theory and helps to overcome some of the limitations of the life cycle approach. This paper also contributes to the literature by fleshing out the roles of complementors, customers, and focal technology producers during industry emergence. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Here, however, we find support for the proposition that deviance can signal one's value to the group. Across five studies, we show that individuals who contribute to groups either by bribing officials, lying to investors, or cheating are given better performance reviews (Study 1), offered higher compensation (Study 2), and are more likely to be selected for future tasks (Study 3) compared to members who refrain from these behaviors but contribute less to group performance. We show that this effect holds when societal (distal) standards (laws) forbid these behaviors (Study 4), but is eliminated when group (proximal) norms discourage them (Study 5). Together, these results suggest that groups maintain a localized sense of morality, valuing members who support group performance, even if their behaviors violate commonly held moral principles which discourage bribery, lying, or cheating. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Findings provide initial support for leader character as a mechanism triggering positive outcomes such that only when officers reported a high level of self-control did their integrity, courage, and empathy manifest in ethical leadership, associated with higher levels of psychological flourishing and in-role performance.

We conducted semi-structured one-on-one and group interviews with project administrators at the three partnering QICs (n=23). Additionally, each collaborative was asked to nominate four higher- and two lower-performing hospitals for further study. At each nominated hospital we interviewed the QI project leads (n=28). For all three QICs, a key element supporting ongoing implementation of the safety bundles and project engagement was leveraging existing partnerships and relationships. For the hospitals, collaborative participation strengthened clinician buy- in, and they reported that the education and implementation tools offered by the collaborative were effective approaches to promoting safety bundle implementation and overcoming contextual challenges.

Prior research has identified the importance of collaborative strategy to allow farms to create value, but has not systematically identified or compared different collaborative strategies. This paper addresses this gap by synthesizing prior work on collaborative ecosystem strategy and identifying two archetypal strategies for increasing value creation in ecosystems: improving partner capabilities, and collaboratively introducing systemic innovations. Each of these strategies carries with it unique advantages and disadvantages with respect to how value is created and captured by frms. Through a formal game theoretic model (specifically, a biform game), we examine when, for whom, and with whom these strategies are effective. We also reveal several surprising insights. For example, we find that farms may be willing to collaborate even when doing so creates no additional value, and that farms may be willing to collaborate even when uncertainty and thus the joint probability of failure is high. Overall, we contribute insight into ecosystems, bottlenecks, and the emergence of kingpins. © 2018 Academy of Management.

However, previous studies on networks did not discuss how asymmetric power relations might play a role of building distrust in the regulatory policy networks where policy actors are engaging in creating collaborative as well as conflictual relations with other participants. This study conceptualizes distrust as a distinct concept from the absence of trust, and highlights the value of asymmetric power in managing the coexistence of trust and distrust in regulatory policy networks. To examine how power imbalance is associated with the coexistence of trust and distrust in a regulatory policy network, we conduct a multinomial logistic analysis of a local hydraulic fracturing policy network in New York in a municipality we call Brownsville. We found that Brownsville's fracking policy network is structured based on the coexisting trust and distrust between policy actors'high trust and high distrust as well as low trust and low distrust. Our findings also indicated that power imbalance plays a role in creating high trust-high distrust relations, and presented that how power imbalance interacts with goal incongruence and various types of social exchanges to lead to the coexisting trust and distrust between actors.

We theorize management learning from the perspective of students who worked with and researched organizations that present an alternative to typical organizational forms and performative intent. Through an analysis of interviews and reflective diaries, we investigate how students learn in such environments and argue that theories of learning must account for how contexts, in which the performance of profit-orientation breaks down, induce reflexivity. In particular, we draw attention to the role such contexts play in challenging students to dwell in inconsistencies, ambiguities, contradictions and non-linear ideas. Drawing upon the work of Judith Butler’s theory of performativity we illustrate that such reflexivity is not an individual capacity but a contextual practice. Subsequently, by ‘decentering the learner’ we develop upon existing ideas on reflexive practitioners and develop the burgeoning literature on alternative organizations. We conclude by making the argument that management education, whether critical or not, needs to go beyond awareness and through to responsible action. Such action does not rely on more tools or concepts for individuals but experiences of inhabiting an increasingly ambiguous and complex world. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The influence of cognitive frame similarity on contingency planning in strategic alliances,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054571383&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.49&partnerID=40&md5=3d2b1c2513854d726c435cdfc726fedc,"Contingency planning is central to strategic alliances because it makes partnerships more reliable and predictable. Thus, it is puzzling to see that partners frequently rely on the prospect of good faith negotiations in the future rather than explicit contractual terms to deal with contingencies. We combine contract theory with social cognition theory to resolve this conundrum. Specifically, we introduce the concept of cognitive frame similarly and suggest that partners with higher cognitive frame similarity are more likely to use good faith provisions than partners with lower cognitive frame similarity. This is because partners with higher cognitive frame similarity are more likely to expect that their interpretations of future contingencies correspond, ultimately decreasing the perceived benefits of explicit contingency planning. Additionally, we argue that the relationship between frame similarity and the partners use of good faith is amplified by their structural similarity. We test our framework on a unique dataset based on manual and computer-assisted content analysis of 705 alliance contracts and 1,410 organizational mission statements from the bio-pharmaceutical industry. Our results support our theory, allowing us to highlight the importance of cognitive frames in inter-organizational relationships and to provide novel perspectives to research on strategic alliances and contract design. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Can supervised machine learning be used to identify family firms using a sophisticated definition?,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054575108&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.154&partnerID=40&md5=100e6bb21e2c58e27e6ea7e47fda045b,"The ability to identify family firms is a critical element of any empirical family businesses study, however obtaining representative time series data that applies complex family firm definitions can be challenging and resource consuming. In this method development paper, I propose that supervised machine learning may be used as a scalable imputation approach after a ‘learner’ has been trained with a combination of survey and registry data. I demonstrate this technique using survey data from 7,153 firms that applies the ‘European definition’ of family firms, which captures elements of voting rights and governance. I combine this data with population registry data containing person- level family relationships who are affiliated with the firms through ownership, board membership, or several other ways. After training several random forest, boosting tree and neural network machine learners, I find that random forest and boosting tree learners obtained the best performance by being able to correctly classify roughly 9 out of 10 firms in holdout samples. Furthermore, several avenues of further improving the accuracy of prediction exist, but their applicability depends on the intended use of the predicted data. Future directions and implications to empirical family business research are discussed. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Specifically, we seek to examine empathic personality as an individual difference predicting more genuine and fewer faked emotional displays, and the downstream consequences of these relationships for employees' job satisfaction, job performance, and workplace absenteeism. Further, we examine how contextual factors such as job stress could serve as a boundary condition to the positive effects of empathy.

Selective permeability of boundaries in a boundary spanning team,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054570453&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.65&partnerID=40&md5=ebb0ba287629dcf9d51afbcb5be95697,"Boundary spanning teams are increasingly deployed in the public sector to promote coordination and integration across previously separated practices. Permeability of external boundaries surrounding such teams is, however, often taken for granted and has so far received relatively little attention. To address this gap, this article presents the findings of an in-depth longitudinal qualitative case study of a boundary spanning team operating in the fragmented healthcare context. It argues that boundary spanning, which increases the permeability of the team boundary, can co-exist with the strategies of disengagement, such as boundary buffering and boundary reinforcement, which reduce permeability. The tension between these seemingly opposing strategies can be resolved through selective permeability, whereby the strength of the external team boundary may vary depending on the out-group with which the team interacts, the out-group's mode of participation, the configuration of the'boundary bridge' deployed and the stage of the boundary spanning project. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The knowledge-incentive trade-off: Understanding the relationship between organizational design and innovation,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054572515&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.94&partnerID=40&md5=159f71b524be0fa8540fec24a89cf6e9,"Managers face a fundamental trade-off when designing their organizations for innovation. On the one hand, a differentiated design with more independent sub-units is associated with high observability of effort and the ability to use higher powered incentives, increasing efforts to innovate. On the other hand, greater differentiation reduces intra-organizational knowledge flows which can hinder innovation. I offer a framework to understand the implications of this trade-off for firms’ innovation outcomes. To do so, I unpack the innovation process into upstream tasks around invention, and downstream tasks around product development and commercialization. I argue that knowledge flows play a more important role towards upstream tasks and incentives play a more important role towards downstream tasks. I explore this premise using fine- grained data on firms’ organizational designs and their innovation outcomes in terms of upstream inventions and downstream product development in the global pharmaceutical industry from 1995 to 2015. I find that greater differentiation while yielding higher numbers of inventions (e.g., patents) is associated with less original inventions that draw on a narrower array of knowledge, and fewer inventions progressing through the earlier stages of development. In contrast, greater differentiation is associated with more inventions progressing through the later stages of development. These findings highlight how the knowledge- and incentives-based perspectives are intertwined with respect to firms’ organizational design, and that viewing innovation as a process can help uncover the trade-offs associated with firms’ design choices. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Tensions between these motives as well as negotiations of actors promoting different motives have not been studied so far. In contrast, this study focuses on conflicting motives, asking how different actors negotiate motives for CSR and how within this process certain motives come to prevail while others get marginalized. Developing a discursive approach to studying motives for CSR, this paper explores how groups of business, state, and civil society actors, despite coming from different backgrounds and having different interests, came to promote the 'business case' as the rather exclusive justification for CSR. Our findings show that the 'business case' emerged as a coalition magnet by appealing to key policy entrepreneurs in the field and allowing scope for different understandings and interpretations by different actors, thereby facilitating the formation of discourse coalitions in support of CSR. The paper contributes to extant literature on CSR by proposing a new approach to the study of motives for CSR, introducing the concepts of discourse coalitions and coalition magnets in order to explain why certain motives become accepted while others get marginalized. It thereby also proposes an explanation for the so far unexplored emergence and rise of the 'business case' for CSR. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The role of operational efficiency in lowering healthcare costs has increased in importance in recent years, yet incentives to reduce costs may not influence physician behavior as hoped if the tasks performed by physicians do not induce them to control costs. Using proprietary data from a Medicare HMO, I find that private practice physicians (who manage their practices) adjust treatment behavior in response to changes in the strength of a cost-control incentive, while physicians in integrated groups (who are not practice managers) do not. I link this difference in behavior to evidence of sorting into group types based on physician preferences. These findings indicate that managers assigning tasks must consider how these decisions will determine the makeup of the firm and how workers who select into the firm based on its structure will behave under the firm's incentive structure. © 2018 Academy of Management.

By a longitudinal ethnography over a two-and-a- half-year stretch in two knowledge-intensive organisations, I explore how newcomers’ identification process are implicated in processes of socialisation in two self-managing teams. The study demonstrates how the distance between newcomers and experienced team members make newcomers engage in ‘identification work’; participatory behaviours that make them more like their fellow experienced team members and fosters identification with their team. Existing team members correspondingly engage in ‘socialisation work’, behaviours that either hinder or foster the socialisation process of newcomers. Reflecting the norms and values in the teams, the team also determines acceptance mechanisms, by which newcomers become considered as full team members. Together, these relational micro-processes of socialisation construct how newcomers’ come to identify with their team. This research adds to and holds implications for the existing literatures on identification and socialisation by showing that they are inextricably intertwined in demonstrating the practices team members collectively engage in when constructing newcomers’ identification in teams. © 2018 Academy of Management.

In Study 1, we found that decision makers in the classic repeated newsvendor task setting show a propensity to forecast demand using perceived trends in the past demand when actually forecasting is normatively inappropriate in this context. We explored two interventions to rectify this pattern of behavior. First, by suppressing the temporal dimension (Supp_Temp_Dim), that is, asking the participants to make newsvendor decisions for 20 different products for the same period instead of making the newsvendor decision 20 times for the same product, we observed a decrease in the extent of forecasting behavior. Second, by imposing standing orders (Stdg_Ord), we observed that it increased the forecasting horizon. In Study 2, we tested an intervention that sensitized the subjects to the critical fractile logic (Crit_Frac) and found that it improved financial performance. The forecasting behavior persisted but the orders now fluctuated around a higher mean than before. The improved understanding of the fundamental cognitive processes that lurk behind the observed decisions can translate into improved real world decision making. © 2018 Academy of Management.

We find that while some continuities with the business models of traditional slavery exist, novel forms of business models have emerged based on new actors, activities, and linkages between activities. We categorize these innovations according to the actor involved (producer/intermediary) and how value is created and captured (revenue generation/cost reduction), giving rise to four innovative models.

These approaches range from collaborative dialogue with firms, to other more coercive methods such as divesting their shareholdings. However, limited consideration has been given to the relative effectiveness of the various corporate governance decisions available to investors. Consequently, this study proposes a behaviorally-grounded strategic view of corporate governance whereby intendedly rational investors choose their corporate governance decisions based on whether the expected response from the targeted firm is preferable to the response from investors' other alternatives. Doing so enables investors to more efficiently allocate their monitoring resources. I operationalize the study by analyzing investors' strategic decisions relating to the use of shareholder proposals. Focusing on environmental, social, and governance issues, I find that investors' use of incentives for collaboration'by withdrawing shareholder proposals'produces more effective outcomes than the coerced enforcement of control'putting the proposal to a vote. A key mediating mechanism relates to firms' cognition of issue salience and the external legitimacy which investor activism signals. In doing so, these findings suggest that investors can strategically channel firms' attention and effort to substantively address the issues raised. © 2018 Academy of Management.

We illustrate these arguments by drawing upon six biographical narrations of female digital entrepreneurs in Saudi Arabia. Accordingly, through our development of a multi-level model, we make explicit the two-way causative interaction between entrepreneurial action, institution altering behavior and the social and cultural context, thus providing a framework for future research. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Although empirical climate research is expanding, connecting climates with a variety of workplace outcomes, theory has yet to explain why climates emerge and affect behavior. Additionally, there is no unified understanding of how climates form or function. These theoretical shortcomings stunt the ability to expand knowledge of this pervasive social construct or to integrate the dispersed body of empirical research on the subject. Consequently, drawing from social psychological theories of motivated social cognition, we articulate a theory of climate that establishes the need to reduce social uncertainty as the reason why climates form and affect behavior. With uncertainty reduction as the conceptual connecting point, we integrate complementary principles from Gestalt psychology, symbolic interactionism, and social learning theory to describe the socio-cognitive processes that explain how climates form and function. In short, we propose that people are driven by the anxiety of social uncertainty to cognitively make sense of their social environments, and that this sensemaking occurs via symbolic social interactions which endow phenomena with shared meaning called climate that informs behavior- guiding individual and group expectancies and ultimately alleviates the anxiety of social uncertainty. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Study 1 established the concept of rank-based rejection sensitivity, showing that people experience a significantly higher level of rejection sensitivity when networking with a higher than lower rank target. Studies 2 and 3 identified that the salience of power, not status, underlies rank-based rejection sensitivity.

Despite this consensus, the field has recently been criticized for using measures of diversity climate that are not linked to diversity theory, including non-climate items, and mixing referents and levels of analysis.

References to leadership implications have been unspecific or contradicted leadership theory ' such as treating all employees well and equally. In this study, we address these shortcomings. We develop and validate a theoretically sound measure of diversity climate and build theory to explain how the underlying nature of leader-member exchange differentiation sends strong signals to employees about whether diversity is valued or not. By focusing on the underlying reasons, we also contribute to the leader-member exchange literature and offer one potential explanation for conflicting findings on the effects of differentiation. © 2018 Academy of Management.

More and more view organizational ambidexterity, the exploration of new opportunities and the exploitation of existing capabilities, as a promising approach to tackle this challenge. While prior research focused on organizational ambidexterity, present research has shifted the focus towards individual ambidexterity. Despite the important role of individuals for achieving ambidexterity and performance at a firm level, the understanding of how exploration of new opportunities and the exploitation of existing capabilities is triggered at an individual level and how it subsequently affects overall performance is still sketchy at best. Based on data from 415 employees, results from structural equation modeling show that both organizational architecture and organizational context can be used to induce individual ambidexterity. Furthermore, the findings of this study also confirm positive performance effects of individual ambidexterity across different organizational levels, namely the team and the department level. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Performance persistence through the lens of chance models: When strong effects of regression to the mean lead to non-monotonic performance associations,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054571129&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.19&partnerID=40&md5=b73b73ec6a1238a6ac262de635686751,"To what extent will performance differences persist? Prior studies have suggested that a large proportion of performance variances cannot be explained by systematic factors. The unexplained variance, i.e., chance implies that one should not expect performance differences to persist. In particular, more extreme performances are likely to regress more to the mean. We empirically examine this statistical account of performance persistence in six datasets: National Football League (2001-2016), National Basketball Association (2004-2017); Major League Baseball (1901-2016), Formula One Racing (1996-2015), return on assets of US firms (1980-2010) and Fortune500 firms (1955-2005). Strong regression effects appear in all datasets and we found a trend of decreasing performance persistence of exceptionally performing firms over the past thirty years. Moreover, the effects of regression can be so strong that they generate non-monotonic performance associations and the contexts determine whether and where these rank reversals occur. Chance models that incorporate the contextual factors are developed to account for these anomalies. We conclude by discussing the implications of chance models for theory building and testing in management and how non-monotonic performance associations imply an alternative source of strategic opportunities with illustrations from sport betting. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Zodiac compatibility between chairmen and CEOs and its impacts on corporate philanthropy in SOEs,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054579928&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.90&partnerID=40&md5=0bc90627dbd25fc0be44ea1efa2c3517,"Separating the chairman and CEO positions is a common requirement for mitigating agency problems in Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs), but Western policies often do not function well in Eastern countries. We propose that the traditional Chinese zodiac may provide better guidance. Specifically, we explore the antecedents of corporate philanthropic giving in SOEs and find that compatible zodiac signs between chairmen and CEOs restrain strategic- driven giving and promote agency-driven giving. Moreover, whether and to what extent chairmen and CEOs share zodiac culture moderates these relationships. We find stronger relationships among firms in regions with high Taoist norms and weaker relationships when the age gap between chairmen and CEOs is larger. This study thus extends our understanding of how Chinese zodiac culture intertwines with Western knowledge of corporate governance to influence SOE practices in China. © 2018 Academy of Management.

We develop an integrative framework shedding new light on the CSP- CFP link, rooted in corporate social responsibility and instrumental stakeholder theories. A comprehensive meta- analysis combining the results of 344 prior studies shows that the positive effect of CSP on CFP is relegated through four complementary paths, all involving improved stakeholder relationships: stakeholder endorsement, reputational improvement, innovation, and risk mitigation. © 2018 Academy of Management.

How does the democratization of a market influence producers' boundary spanning decisions? Compared to lay actors, professionals specialized in the market may be more knowledgeable about its boundaries and benefit more from a clearly defined market. As the power shifts from professionals to laypeople, producers may be more likely to span market boundaries in hope of reaching a larger audience. The general trend of boundary spanning may also open up niches for authentic products in the core of the market. As a result, some producers may choose not to span boundaries in order to appeal to audiences who value authenticity. I exploit a Billboard chart policy shock that shifted the power from genre radio stations to casual listeners in some music markets. Using a measure of """"crossover"""" based on acoustic features of the song recordings, I find that average producers increasingly borrow elements from other musical genres after democratization. Meanwhile, the democratized market as a whole becomes less distinctive from others. Moreover, the crossover effect is driven by established firms and generalist organizations. This study offers important and nuanced implications for product variety, market boundaries and the rise of lay actors in the market. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Rooted in multiple perspectives of role theory (i.e., role strain, role accumulation, and role transition), I propose two mechanisms leading from fragmentation of time to perception of role conflict (i.e., inter-role conflict and person-role conflict). Building on this, I argue that monochronics perceive increased levels of role conflict in multiteaming situations. Meanwhile, their polychronic counterparts are predicted to even report reduced perceptions of role conflict at an increasing fragmentation of time across multiple teams. Finally, I also examine conditional indirect effects on distal outcomes, such as job performance, job satisfaction, and well-being. The proposed model is tested in a longitudinal sample of 341 German employees. Multiple regression and bootstrapping analyses strongly support the hypothesized relationships.

Building on signaling theory and person- environment (PE) fit theory, this paper investigates whether the degree of clarity of an employer brand and the degree of fit between employer brand elements and individual preferences (PE fit) are both positively linked with employer attractiveness and whether the two determinants interact. Using a dataset containing 33395 separate responses, 2880 individuals and 256 Belgian organizations, a cross-classified multilevel model was tested. Findings show that both employer brand clarity and PE fit strongly affect employer attractiveness on top of appealing features of the employer, e.g. career progression opportunities. Unexpectedly, a negative interaction effect between PE fit and employer brand clarity was found, indicating that brand clarity is useful in case of low PE fit but not in case of high PE fit in which people already report high levels of employer attractiveness. The results indicate that clear and targeted branding helps to increase the effectiveness of employer brands. © 2018 Academy of Management.

We find that counterfactual reasoning is superior to disconfirmation with respect to (1) counteracting the confirmation bias, (2) promoting the exploration of the scenario space, and (3) favoring the adoption of actions able to mitigate or exploit the consequences of Black Swans. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Leaders are permanently confronted with change; they must cope with critical developments and rapidly respond to unexpected events. In this context, leaders' resilience turned out to be crucial not only to leaders' health and well-being but also to that of their followers and, thus, plays an important role in the competitiveness of organizations. To give a coherent picture of the current state of research, structure the existing knowledge and identify major research gaps, we conducted a systematic literature review. This review shows that, although the interest in leaders' resilience has plainly increased in the past few years, hardly any coherent and context-dependent definition, measure, or framework of leaders' resilience has been formulated. Instead, most research still aims to identify person-related factors that are relevant to leaders' resilience. In sum, not much is known about the leaders' resilience process including its various influencing factors and outcomes. As our study conveys a comprehensive understanding of the current knowledge regarding leaders' resilience, it presents a substantial starting point for further research including a clear research agenda. © 2018 Academy of Management.

While categorization is a crucial first step is the valuation process, the heterogeneity of audience members’ categorization is a blind spot in research on market categories. In this paper, we propose to study a) the relationship between category-spanning’s distance and perceived atypicality, a link that, while assumed, has never been tested, b) the effect of the variation of audience members’ expertise on how they perceived a category-spanner as atypical and c) how the mode of categorization, either based on goals or based on prototypes, affects such perceived atypicality. We test our hypotheses through an on-line experiment. As expected, we find that category-spanning’s distance increases perceived atypicality and that this effect is, at the subordinate level of classification, present only for experts. As hypothesized, expertise is significantly and positively associated with perceived atypicality. We obtain partial confirmation for the effect of goal-based categorization on perceived atypicality (but no moderating effect on the relationship between expertise and perceived atypicality).

We then identify key variables that render time variant thinking more or less central to entrepreneurial action cognitions, and explore time variant thinking's effects on outcomes. The framework we advance has important implications for our understanding of time and temporality in entrepreneurship and accounts for the realization that entrepreneurs often consider multiple opportunities simultaneously or sequentially. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Both institutional theory and population ecology suggest that in a nascent industry an increase in the number of firms legitimize all industry members. However, late entrants may suffer penalties because audiences interpret their late entry as a lack of authenticity associated with low customer commitment. In this paper, we theorize and test how the order of entry shapes firms' competitive outcomes. Using an experimental approach, we disentangle two at times countervailing forces'audiences' simultaneous preference for authenticity and legitimacy. We distinguish between 'core value' and 'symbolic features' in products or services, and argue that the penalty for follower firms is likely to arise when the late entrant firms share even the symbolic features of their predecessor. We test our theory with an online experiment using examples of startup companies in the healthcare industry. The results show that a late entrant suffers from lower levels of market selection when it shares both the business model (core value) and the website design (symbolic features) with the first entrant, but this 'copycat discount' is significantly alleviated when the late entrant does not share the first mover's symbolic features. However, while direct measures of legitimacy show a strong effect on market selection, we do not find support that this is impacted by density. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Drawing on organizational learning and institutional theories, I argue that institutional heterogeneity in China offers firms an opportunity to develop routines to overcome the liability of foreignness through gaining acquisition experience outside of their home province. Further, I propose that coastal and inland firms develop different routines from coastal and inland acquisition experience. I test these arguments on a panel dataset of listed Chinese firms, tracing their acquisition behavior from 2006 to 2015. My analyses suggest that acquisition experience outside of the home province matters and that, in the case of inland firms, coastal acquisition experience is particularly beneficial for future internationalization. The present study contributes to the literature on the internationalization of Chinese firms. It highlights the value of context-specific measures for Chinese management research, sheds light on the functionality of institutional heterogeneity in China, and provides evidence to re-evaluate the degree of risk of Chinese firms cross-border growth. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Put yourself in others’ age: How age simulation facilitates intergenerational cooperation,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054574217&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.249&partnerID=40&md5=880e963fce79cb39b03f3e9cd860efb0,"We suggest that different generations differ in the meaning they ascribe to their work, which hinders mutual understanding and cooperation. In addition, we propose that part of the inter- generational differences are caused by the different life stages that people occupy. Thus, age simulation–envisioning oneself in another age group–can reduce one’s perceived dissimilarity with another generation in work meaning and facilitate inter-generational understanding and cooperation. With a survey of 1000 Chinese working adults, we found inter- generational difference in work meaning. Millennials regard their work more as a means to obtain status and less to support families than the older two generations. Cultural Revolution generation members regards work more as a way to serve society than the other two generations. These difference in work meaning are negatively related to perceived oneness, which further influences willingness to help and mentor members of another generation. Among the 1000 participants, 520 participated in a mental simulation task– envisioning one’s work in a different generation’s life stage. Age simulation significantly reduced perceived dissimilarity and increased perceived oneness, perspective taking, and willingness to help and mentor the other generation. The findings hold important implications for communication, diversity management, and group cohesion in the workplace. © 2018 Academy of Management.

We theorize that organizational expectations trigger frequent employee micro-transitions during nonwork time, eliciting negative affect and leading to decreases in well-being. In a sample of 142 dyads of full time employees and their significant others, we found that detrimental health and relationship effects of expectations were mediated by negative affect. This includes crossover effects of electronic communication expectations on partner health and martial satisfaction.

Family business as a longstanding hybrid organisation: Logic revision as a strategy for maintenance,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054577964&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.220&partnerID=40&md5=8370bc38b3b12ed4795b9cecc25b110f,"Hybrid organisations, organisational forms that combine multiple institutional logics, have recently attracted substantial scholarly attention. Ongoing maintenance of hybridity has been identified as a key challenge for hybrid organisations. This paper puts forward family businesses that integrate family and business logics as the world’s oldest and the most pervasive form of hybrid organisation, and explores their organisational maintenance strategies for sustaining such hybridity. Based on an oral history study of longstanding family businesses in Scotland, we propose ‘logic revision’, i.e. a socially constructed and evolving reinterpretation of logics, as another strategy for organisational maintenance in the hybrid organisational context. As opposed to the known strategies of decoupling, compromising, structural separation and selective coupling that rely on the deterministic properties of institutional logics, this strategy draws on their socially constructed nature. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Value of friendship: Instrumental and sentimental motivations for corporate executives’ networking behavior,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054576512&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.178&partnerID=40&md5=16b0358cf8043aa75d4a188608d83c39,"Research on corporate executives' social networks has primarily focused on the consequences of interpersonal ties between corporate executives. Relatively little attention has been paid to the motivation of executives in forming and retaining interpersonal ties. Drawing on social exchange theory, we argue that corporate executives have both instrumental and sentimental dimensions of networking motivations in building and retaining friendship and advice ties with other executives. Our results show that higher (lower) distance along instrumental (sentimental) motivations of networking between executives increases the likelihood of friendship seeking tie since corporate executives evaluate different dimensions of benefits from interpersonal ties. Furthermore, our findings show that corporate executives seek advice from more competent executives, conditional on the executive being a friend. Over time, the sentimental dimension of motivation loses influence on friendship tie but the instrumental dimension of motivation continues to impact corporate executive's networking behavior. Our empirical study utilizing social network data among Korean corporate executives from 2 time periods provides strong support for our theoretical contribution. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Climbing invisible walls: The construction of career (im)mobility in liminal professional roles,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054576236&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.190&partnerID=40&md5=b37424d40849b3940d3c02423a500948,"Drawing on 67 interviews with paraprofessionals and professionals in four leading law firms, we examine the construction of career immobility in liminal roles. Specifically, we analyze how individual paraprofessionals make sense of and experience staying in a role that they expected to be transitional and temporary. We find that in professional environments ideal forms of movement exist which evoke feelings of career immobility for those who cannot fulfill them. Further, we show that individuals experience career immobility in different ways, informed by how they frame career liminality in their career narrative. Practices enacted in response to experiences of career immobility are cognitively or behaviorally focused but do not challenge the ideal as people hold on to the belief that eventually they will be admitted to the professional sphere. This belief set limits to their willingness to engage in career practices that would effectively increase their career mobility within the profession. This study challenges the premise that mobility has become prevalent in contemporary careers. Instead it demonstrates how career mobility and career immobility mutually inform each other. It suggests that career immobility emerges through people’s constructions of themselves as immobile in their career. As such it shifts the focus away from people’s actual movements and the factors constraining them to how they make sense of and experience movement in their careers, and the lack thereof. © 2018 Academy of Management.

However, the precise forms, characteristics, and effects of prototypes in the categorization process remain unclear. We address this gap by conducting a discourse analysis of different stakeholder contributions to the emergence of the new legal category of ‘modern slavery’ in the context of the UK’s Modern Slavery Act, 2015. Drawing on a political agency view of categorization, our findings reveal that contrary to existing research, the role of prototypes in categorization is heterogeneous. Our analysis identifies four different general forms of prototype, namely typifying, mobilizing, familiarizing, and scoping prototypes, each of which are deployed by different actors to achieve specific goals in the emergence and consolidation of the new category. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Results based on a two-wave study of 806 police officers nested in 35 police stations supported our expectations of a curvilinear relationship between TFL and emotional exhaustion. In line with the too-much-of-a-good-thing effect, we found that emotional exhaustion decreased as TFL increased from low to moderate levels. However, the emotional exhaustion decrease was attenuated when TFL increased from moderate to high levels.

The paper develops a typology of forms of parentalism along two structuring dimensions: care and control. Specifically, the typology suggests four different ways in which business may use parentalism to legitimate its power. First, prescribing mobilizes coercion and is justified by the moral responsibility vis-vis the dependent child. Second, nudging mobilizes authority and is justified as it helps the child overcome her lack of self-control for her own good. Third, convening mobilizes manipulation and is justified through educating and supporting the child who lacks knowledge and resources. Fourth, involving mobilizes domination and is justified by the involvement of stakeholders as co-equals in deliberation. As we consider current private governance through this analytical framework, we are able to provide a new perspective on the nature of the moral legitimation of power dynamics in contemporary business-society relations. And we weave the threads between this conceptual frame and historical antecedents, suggesting that business ethicists need to revive old debates on paternalism in light of the current pervasive trend of modernized and subtler forms of parentalism. Implications for business ethics and (political) CSR are discussed. © 2018 Academy of Management. All rights reserved.",,Business ethics; Moral responsibility; Power dynamics; Wine

Opportunity or threat? Organizational aspiration determination in an environmental jolt,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054588853&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.41&partnerID=40&md5=6178bb3e658542e37d6d329368815f25,"Organizational aspiration determination has long been discussed in conventional behavioral theory and has been widely used in subsequent empirical research. However, prior work is largely limited to the context of stable or incrementally changing environments and overlooks the role of managerial cognition in the process of determining aspirations. Extending the behavioral work of aspirations, we address two questions: first, whether the three reference points proposed by conventional behavioral theory are salient aspiration antecedents in the context of an environmental jolt; second, how organization’s opportunity and threat orientation during an environmental jolt shape its attention allocation among different reference points when determining aspirations. Using a sample of U.S. public firms during the global financial crisis in 2007-2009, we find that organizations use past aspiration and past performance when determining aspirations during a jolt. Whilst more opportunity-oriented organizations focus more attention on past aspiration and less attention on past performance, more threat-oriented organizations focus less attention on past aspiration. Our work has important implications to decision makers responsible for setting organizational goals. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Drawing on the literature on routine dynamics, and emotion in organizations, I analyze emotions expressed during the interaction between groups of participants in collaborative design projects. Through an interpretive case study, I find that emotions expressed toward design objects (i.e., artifacts) create collective understanding that enables connections among actors. However, emotions are situational in nature and groups do not perform all interdependent routines communally. Thus, new emotions may arise that change one group's understanding and weaken connection between groups. In such cases, participants recreate collective understanding through practice. This study adds to the literature on routine dynamics by demonstrating how emotions contribute to routine performance when they involve participants across organizational boundaries. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Intermediate state capabilities and informal entrepreneurship: A configurational perspective,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054577293&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.146&partnerID=40&md5=b2dcfd884473fd7dac6ac8e0401ba9a7,"Drawing on recent ""neo-configurational"" theorizing in the broader management literature (Misangyi et al., 2017), we propose that the effects of national institutions on informal entrepreneurial activities are best viewed as multi- dimensional and conjunctural. To advance this institutional-configurational perspective, we conducted a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fs/QCA) of the effects of institutional configurations on both the degree and type of informal labor across 129 countries. Building inductively from our analysis of the joint presence and absence of institutional capabilities across multiple domains, we propose that the presence of ""intermediate state capabilities"" which we define as states that possess capabilities in some institutional domains but not others moderates the relationship between informal economic activity and entrepreneurially-driven economic growth. That is, the highest levels of ""growth- oriented"" informal entrepreneurship are likely to occur in national contexts where the state may lack the full set of capabilities that are necessary to create a strong formal economy, but nonetheless possesses some capabilities to provide an enabling environment for more productive forms of informal entrepreneurial activity. In the discussion of our results, we explore the contribution of our configurational argument to seeing new forms of institutional heterogeneity across the developing world. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Whereas previous literature on age dependence focused on the effects of aging for individual organizations, we analyze how aging processes drive the evolution of markets. We offer an age-related explanation for the mechanism of resource partitioning, i.e., the relative increase in the number of new entrants in a market's periphery as a result of increasing concentration among central incumbents. We theorize that, as the incumbents within a category grow older, their capacity to undertake structural changes diminishes: coupled with evolving audience preferences, this generates a gap between what the incumbents are capable to offer and what the audience demands, hence creating opportunities for new entrants to step into the market. We also conjecture that such entry opportunities are more likely in younger categories, where the audience's preferences change more rapidly. We test our arguments through a longitudinal study of market segments in the recording industry. © 2018 Academy of Management.

While specialization 'donating a lot to a few causes' may allow for greater effectiveness in giving, variety 'giving a little to many causes' enables the firm to serve a wider range of heterogeneous stakeholder preferences.

Results from a uniquely detailed data on 726 US firms' corporation donation from 2003 to 2011 support our theory, with firms that give to more varied causes realizing higher profits, and this effect being stronger for non- local giving, giving by less reputed firms, giving in markets with more heterogeneous stakeholders, and for variety across rather than within causes. © 2018 Academy of Management.

We argue that competence is only one valued individual characteristic on which status may be based; more important, willingness to share, or prosociality, is not the only social orientation that predicts status. Inspired by the literatures on coolness and adolescent popularity, we argue that cues of antisociality'specifically, of defiance and exclusivity'can foster prestige-based status conferral, by prompting inferences of agency. In three studies, we find support for these predictions, examining status conferral to celebrities, to US presidential candidates, and to collaborating members of task teams. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Building on a 25-month field study of the Da Vinci robot, an endoscopic system for minimally invasive surgery, we trace how the introduction of the robot was consequential for the practice of surgery. Following augmentations and reductions of surgeons capacities to perform surgery with the robot, the operating team had to enact major changes in how they coordinated their activities, which ultimately resulted in new work arrangements, whereby the surgeon supervisory responsibilities were reduced, the nurses autonomy and responsibility increased, residents were reduced to mere students and anesthesiologists became guardians of patients safety. In contrast to the previous studies of technology interplay with work and occupations, change could not be attributed to a specific technological feature or to a deliberate organizational restructuring. Instead, change occurred as a result of disruption and reweaving of the embodied dependencies underlying the collective performance. Our findings highlight the importance of embodied skilled performances for understanding how the introduction of novel technology affects organizing. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Estimating the multiplicative heteroscedasticity regression model on the data from 2975 new ventures from Kauffman Firm Survey, we assess the distinct impact of founding team's human capital components on firm growth and variability of firm growth in the short- and medium-term (3 to 7 years after founding), with controlling the survivorship bias. Whereas team size, commitment, and past venture experience positively affect firm growth without affecting the variability, the team industry work experience and education significantly increase variability without affecting the mean. Finally, age of team members and the ratio of native-born owners have a negative impact on firm growth and positive impact on its variability. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Two research questions guided our inquiry: How do Korean women leaders experience the token effect as Kanter described? How does the social and cultural context affect their token status? Critical to this investigation was an understanding of two conceptual frameworks represented in the literature concerning women in leadership: tokenism theory and the cultural context of Korea. To answer the two research questions, we conducted a secondary analysis of qualitative data in which the aim was to address new research questions by analyzing previously collected data. To that end, we reanalyzed a total of 107 women leaders' narratives that were collected in the previous research on women leaders in Korea by incorporating three concepts (visibility, contrast, and assimilation) of tokenism theory. The study findings revealed the importance of cultural context in the investigation of women leaders' token status. We also found that women leaders as tokens assimilated to meet the dominant group's (men's) expectations in the organization but also managed to resist in their own ways. This study finding of women leaders' effort for assimilation and resistance in the challenging workplace is a uniquely Korean phenomenon, which has not been captured in research on women leaders using tokenism theory in Western contexts.

However, there is limited understanding of whether or not ADHD symptoms of entrepreneurs are functional in terms of firm performance. Drawing on two samples of entrepreneurs we found that impulsive and hyperactive symptoms of ADHD are conducive to firm performance while inattention symptoms are not. Further, the positive relationship between ADHD symptoms and firm performance is fully mediated by Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO). We discuss the implications of our findings for entrepreneurship literature. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Bridging divides: Translating the concept of sustainable livelihoods to rural Indonesia through institutional empowerment work,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054559578&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.46&partnerID=40&md5=4e7a221e68869c1c8f385fa41cba3bc5,"This study delivers insights into how heterogeneous promoters and adopters of an idea can overcome asymmetries regarding their life- worlds and positions of power to achieve idea translation. Based on the case of the translation of the concept of sustainable livelihoods to Indonesia, which involved rural farmers and an international conservation NGO, we argue that translation involving heterogeneous actors requires multiple dimensions of institutional empowerment work jointly executed through promoters, adopters and boundary-spanning intermediaries. First, political empowerment work refers to building structures for the participation of the low- power stakeholders during translation, enabling adopters to actively contribute their perspectives. Second, social empowerment work relates to establishing relationships between promoters and adopters that support the process of translation, through addressing a lack of interpersonal trust and adopters' identification with an idea. We contribute through developing a processual view of translation, which complicates the largely one-directional notion of translation prevalent in the literature. Furthermore, we present types of institutional work required to establish cooperation among heterogeneous actors, a dimension of work that has so far been understudied, and deliver insights into tackling grand challenges involving outsider-driven institutional change. © 2018 Academy of Management.

In studying such projects and policies, sociologists have identified productive collaborations between state officials and private sector representatives as a key component of successful initiatives. Scholars argue that strong state-private ties allow for greater exchange of technical expertise and are mutually beneficial. In this study, we present a case that challenges the familiar perspective that strong state-private ties are associated with successful initiatives. We examine how officials in the Indian government collaborated with private sector representatives to design and implement an industrial crafts park that ultimately failed to achieve its economic goals. Using ethnographic observations, interviews, and supplemental survey data, we show that status biases in tie formation and occupational heterogeneity in the private sector make state officials vulnerable to designing programs that are misaligned with private sector needs, even when they work closely with private sector representatives. This study reveals how micro-level interaction patterns aggregate to influence large-scale development outcomes. More broadly, it highlights an important but undertheorized pathway by which bureaucrats may inadvertently cement social stratification through the very projects that aim to alleviate economic inequality. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Specifically, we distinguish between two different functional roles constraints can play'constraints can either direct attention and effort towards a certain subset of solutions (directive role) or they can guide attention and effort away from a certain part of the solution space (indirective role). Using this distinction as our theoretical foundation, we then develop theory as to how constraints may impact individual creativity via two distinct cognitive pathways'cognitive flexibility and perseverance. In addition, we consider the ways in which expertise and time alter the use of these pathways thereby shaping individual creativity. We close by suggesting directions for future research on constraints and by offering directions for how constraints can be used to meaningfully enhance individual creativity. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Leadership identity claims and resource acquisition of new ventures in dynamic industries,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054557831&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.160&partnerID=40&md5=16d16e98799d8fde9ee82366a69f69f9,"In dynamic industries, it is not clear how to effectively construct an entrepreneurial identity. On one hand, new ventures have opportunity space to claim a leadership identity that gives them a competitive advantage. On the other hand, the very same situation also means that every venture can claim a leadership identity, which can create noise and generate doubts among investors about the plausibility of new ventures’ identity claims. Thus we ask the research questions: Do leadership identity claims help new ventures in dynamic industries acquire resources from the venture capital market? Under what conditions will such claims be more effective? Drawing on social psychological perspectives, we develop and test three hypotheses: (1) in dynamic industries, a new venture’s leadership claim frequency has an inverted-U shaped relationship with the amount of VC funding it obtains; (2) the number of competitors claiming leadership negatively moderates the baseline relationship; (3) the clarity of industry boundary positively moderates the baseline relationship. Based on a dataset composed of 5,597 U.S.-based IT new ventures founded between 2003 and 2012, we found strong support for the first two hypotheses. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Our findings contribute to family business scholarship by showing that fiduciaries can play the integrative 'man in the middle' role, integrating competing sets of assumptions, cognitions, emotions and practices into a functional whole. Moreover, we contribute to literature on institutional logics by mapping out how fiduciaries are able to straddle multiple logics'particularly those of commerce and family'allowing firms to remain robust in the face of change, particularly in leadership. © 2018 Academy of Management.

In this paper, we identify a novel intervention that boosts women's earnings and reduces this gap in an informal, residential marketplace. We argue that micro-spatial resources offer specific, gendered advantages to female business owners. We show how gendered constraints on women's labor market activity intersect with spatial resources to powerfully influence their likelihood of running a home-based business and their self-employment earnings. Using data from a Colombian public housing complex, we find that the randomly assigned location of a resident's apartment significantly influences women's business activity, but not men's. Women who run informal, home-based businesses from favorable locations earn more than twice as much as comparable women, close the gender earnings gap in self-employment by 58.5%, and earn an income that lifts them above the poverty line. Overall, this study offers a new perspective on how gender and micro-geography intersect to shape self-employment, and shows how self-employment can function as a lever for women's economic mobility in developing countries. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Drawing on effectuation theory, this study examines social entrepreneurs strategies to combine intangible resources based on entrepreneurs identities, knowledge, and networks, as well as tangible financial resources, to pursue the SE process. Findings from eight case studies of social enterprises also reveal an important role of identity resources in resource combination strategies throughout the SE process, thereby proposing the notion of identity-based resource mobilization. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Although a considerable amount of attention has been paid to when innovations are adopted, few studies have considered the reverse process of when innovations are abandoned. We examine this process among employees in a large technology company using a unique dataset on the use of an enterprise collaboration system'an innovative software tool used to help employees collaborate with one another. The data consider a bipartite network of over 49,000 employees connected by over 26,000 communities, over a time period of around 4 years. Using timestamped data on posts to the software, we construct a real-time measure of when an employee begins using the software and ultimately abandons the software. We find that employees are more likely to stop using the software when the software has lesser value for them. Value is measured as the number of other users of the software. We consider value both locally'the number of other users that someone is connected to'and globally'the number of users in the company as whole. Our findings shed light on how use in different areas of an organization can cascade into widespread adoption or abandonment, and on the diffusion of innovations process as a whole. © 2018 Academy of Management.

We also conduct scale-specific moderator analyses. Overall, self- monitoring shows criterion-oriented validity for status criteria, good discriminant validity to other dispositional antecedents of status, and incremental validity for most criteria examined.

Discrimination and entrepreneurship: Evidence from LGBT rights laws,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054562900&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.251&partnerID=40&md5=54dd3341cece73ed054bf19c1ca05ab6,"This study revisits the well-established claim that reducing discrimination spurs entrepreneurial entry. We propose that the effect of antidiscrimination initiatives on entrepreneurship depends crucially on whether discrimination originates on the demand- or the supply-side of the entrepreneurial process. The benefits of antidiscrimination practices in the context of entry are based on the study of the demand-side discrimination, or bias which arises when prospective entrepreneurs face discrimination by key resource providers for a new venture (i.e., investors, banks, prospective employers). We hypothesize the opposite effect on the supply-side, or when prospective entrepreneurs face discrimination in paid employment. Using evidence from the enactment of LGBT antidiscrimination policies, we show that initiatives to reduce employer discrimination deter entry into entrepreneurship because they increase the appeal of paid employment relative to entrepreneurship. Despite the reduction in the rates of entrepreneurship, however, new ventures growth orientation increases because antidiscrimination policies motivate the pursuit of higher-potential opportunities. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Academics at play: Why the “publication game” is more than a metaphor,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054567850&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.32&partnerID=40&md5=b0342db85ded884be952dc1a962331fa,"It is increasingly common for academic work to be described as a ‘publication game’. For some, the idea of academic game-playing serves as a convenient metaphor for explaining concrete phenomenon such as professional advancement or instrumental careerism in the context of national research assessments such as the recent Research Excellence Framework (REF) in the UK. However, we suggest that academic game-playing should not solely be understood in metaphorical terms. Rather, we propose that many of the attributes of play – as articulated by play theorists – can be usefully applied to understand and problematize academic research under the contemporary ‘regime of excellence’. Drawing on extensive interviews with critical management scholars, we argue that academia is characterized by a ‘lusory attitude’ towards research; this means that scholars relate to their work as players relate to a game. Ultimately, we seek to show how the separation between ‘mere’ game-playing and ‘real’ research is not possible to maintain in practice. In doing so, we also problematize the ‘separation thesis’ in play theory, which holds that play, by its very nature, is strictly separated from ‘reality’. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Both streams rely on the assumption of long-term owners, who create spillovers to other stakeholders or enable synergies between stakeholders and shareholders. However, stock-holding periods have become much shorter over the past decades, causing unprecedented ownership volatility. In this paper, we clarify the impact of ownership volatility on stakeholder orientation. Drawing on an attention perspective, we argue that two distinct mechanisms are at play: First, an increase in ownership volatility attracts managers' short-term situated attention, leading to a narrow orientation to shareholders. Second, a constantly high level of ownership volatility affects managers' long-term focus of attention, motivating a broad stakeholder orientation. Based on an empirical study of more than 1,300 firms, we find evidence for our arguments. Our main theoretical contribution is that firms' stakeholder orientation is not set ex ante, but changes over time with ownership volatility. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Stigma avoidance and the delay of foreign exits of emerging economy multinational enterprises,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054560653&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.112&partnerID=40&md5=fd4b6305c1e75ff66236dce142f77575,"When a foreign subsidiary fails to meet expectations, how quickly will investors pull the plug and withdraw? We argue that the phenomenon of stigma avoidance induces some types of emerging market multinational enterprises to delay divestments of foreign operations. Specifically, we argue that the risk of a stigma of failure creates pressures on managers to retain a business, even at the expense of profitability. Integrating the concept of stigma with institutional theory, we explore variations across firms in different ownership types. A stigma of failure is more likely to be damaging to managers in state-controlled firms (compared to private enterprises) and in family firms (compared to individual-controlled firms). In these types of firms, the impact of stigma avoidance is magnified by ownership concentration, status awareness of the chief executive officer (CEO), and the importance of status in the national culture. © 2018 Academy of Management.

"CEO ideology, peer influence, and strategic adoption of CSR executive position by fortune 500 firms",2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054563122&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.201&partnerID=40&md5=117882136e1c3323a852e34ae01d8149,"Prior research in upper echelons suggests that CEO values shape the decisions and outcomes of their firms. Our study extends this literature by considering how CEO values, conceptualized in terms of CEO political ideology (on the conservatism-liberalism spectrum), can influence other CEOs' strategic decisions. Specifically, we integrate research on upper echelons with inter-organizational imitation to argue that ideological incongruence'i.e., the perceived incompatibility between a CEO's values and the new practice they adopt' positively affects its subsequent adoption by other CEOs. In particular, we theorize that conservative-leaning CEOs' decisions to adopt a CSR executive position (i.e., appoint a CSR specialist in the top management team) will be imitated at a higher rate by observing CEOs than those of liberal-leaning CEOs due to the increased perceptual salience and situational attributions associated with ideologically-incongruent actions. We further posit that these effects will be stronger when observing CEOs themselves lean conservative and when observing firms experience shareholder pressure to improve their CSR efforts. We test these ideas in a sample of Fortune 500 companies during 2001-2013 and find broad support for our hypotheses. Additionally, in supplementary experimental analyses, we find some evidence for our envisioned theoretical mechanisms. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Escaping poverty: Women entrepreneurs' journeys toward empowerment and sustained livelihood,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054566114&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.25&partnerID=40&md5=03c3fc29dda341e391506d36e4880f0c,"This paper examines the transformational role of entrepreneurship for the empowerment and sustained livelihood of women in poverty. We conducted a field study using interviews with 134 Indian women entrepreneurs in five categories of businesses. Although the women living under (extreme) poverty and oppressive socio-cultural norms engage in entrepreneurial activities out of desperation, the process of entrepreneuring has deeply transformational effects on their personal and professional lives. By working within and around the socio-cultural and institutional constraints they face, women entrepreneurs gradually redefine the norms and values of their families and communities to gain acceptance and recognition of their economic contributions. Further, the learning and personal growth they experience as a part of entrepreneuring are associated with elevation of their business goals from meeting basic subsistence needs to ensuring long-term sustained livelihood for their families. Our paper contributes to the entrepreneuring-as- emancipation perspective by extending its focus from an entrepreneurial project to a life-changing transformational process of empowerment. © 2018 Academy of Management.

A pluralist conceptualization of scholarly impact in management education,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054569626&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.132&partnerID=40&md5=ada8a729acbbfb84fe65afc1be50a5ce,"Knowledge transfer is the primary conduit through which management professors communicate what is known about human and organizational dynamics. This process has been conceptualized by the construct of scholarly impact. However, scholarly impact is often conceptualized and measured as an internal exchange, exclusively within and between communities of researchers. We investigated external knowledge transfer to a critical management education constituency: Students. To do so, we used bibliometric methods to investigate scholarly impact in management education by examining which sources, articles, and authors are most frequently cited in 38 widely-used organizational behavior (OB), human resource management (HRM), strategic management (SM), and general management (GM) textbooks. By extracting all endnotes and references, we created a database including 7,445 unique sources (e.g., peer-reviewed journals, business periodicals), 33,719 unique articles and book chapters, and 32,981 unique authors. Examples of our findings include: (a) there is no clear relation between journals and authors cited most frequently in other journals and those most frequently cited in textbooks; (b) on average, 36 percent of the most cited sources in OB, HRM, SM, and GM textbooks are non-academic; and (c) fewer than 1% of the most cited articles in textbooks overlap across the different disciplines. Taken together, our results offer novel insights based on a more pluralistic and broader approach to evaluating knowledge transfer. Results have implications for the conceptualization and measurement of knowledge transfer and the design of academic performance management and reward systems, the science-practice divide, and choices regarding what knowledge academics create. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Hospital Group Purchasing alliance and financial performance,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054566099&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.77&partnerID=40&md5=f187d6202aff09d99eac18580cd5686b,"Given the potential benefits of Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) in cost-containment efforts for hospitals on supplies and purchased services. An important question that remains unanswered is are there financial performance differences between users and non-users of GPOs. Therefore, this study explores if there is any financial performance between users and non-users of GPOs by hospitals. Data on hospital GPO utilization and financial performance were combined with secondary hospital market characteristics. Panel ordinal logistic regression with facility and year fixed effects analysis was used to examine the relationship between operating margin and use of GPO controlling for organizational and market characteristics. Data from 4,484 hospitals were available for analyses. Overall, the number of hospitals utilizing the services of GPOs increased significantly from 3,027 (72.9%) in 2004 to 3,128 (75.2%) in 2013. The major findings suggest that there is an association between the hospitals financial performance and their utilization of GPO services. Specifically, hospitals that utilized the services of GPOs had higher operating margins compared to hospitals that did not. This paper contributes to the literature of strategic management and provides policymakers and researchers an avenue that identifies whether the utilization of GPOs by hospitals has any financial bearing. © 2018 Academy of Management.

A self-regulation perspective on the relationship between presenteeism and productivity loss,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054564193&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.116&partnerID=40&md5=0b9efd63c0c4a7919bd2575fb75a16b1,"In this study, we aim to unpack the relationship between presenteeism or attending work while ill and productivity losses. The presenteeism literature has been atheoretical. The few theoretical models developed focused on what makes people attend work while ill or the antecedents of presenteeism but not on what happens or on how people manage their illness once they have decided to attend work while ill. We develop a self-regulation model rooted in goal setting theory and multiple goal pursuit on the relationship between presenteeism and productivity. We propose that disease symptoms serve as distractors. When people set high and specific goals, they prioritize performance and distract their attention away from their disease. As such, goals set should moderate the relationship between presenteeism and productivity. We find evidence for this hypothesis which we call the focus hypothesis across two settings, both field and experimental. Overall, this study builds on previous literature and enriches the presenteeism research with a self-regulation model. © 2018 Academy of Management.

This study extends existing literature and addresses the questions of how i-deals operate in an organizational context. Drawing on i-deals literature, we proposed that employees' i-deals affect organizational performance via their job attitude and coworker relations in different ways. We argued that i-deals are related to employee job attitude in a positive manner while coworker relations are influenced in a non-linear manner. These different relationships are manifesting themselves in organizational performance. Moreover, we postulated that the mediating effects are dependent on both leadership behavior focused on individuals and collectives. Data collected from a sample of German organizations supports our empirical model. This study contributes to i-deals research by relating i-deals to organizational performance via different mediators and integrating contextual conditions. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Variance decomposing of accelerator and cohort effects among London startups,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054559046&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.80&partnerID=40&md5=225d5cc732c2893f88212bb695ca8f6f,"A decade after the launch of Y-Combinator, there are dozens of accelerators all around the globe. And while the nurturing effect afforded by accelerator organizations is the subject of scholarly work, we know less about the dynamics that arise organically among the participants of a focal cohort. We synthesize the literature on accelerators to infer that accelerator participation could affect venture outcomes through mechanisms that operate at two distinct levels: i) the accelerator organization (top-down), and ii) the particular cohort of the accelerator that a venture attended (bottom-up). We report a variance decomposition analysis of a proprietary dataset of all ventures graduating from major London-based accelerators since 2008. We find that cohort membership explains about half of the total explained variance in venture outcomes whereas accelerator membership explains a lower fraction of ultimate funding success. For top accelerators, however, industry effect dominates both accelerator and cohort membership effects. Our findings suggest that nascent venture performance is more sensitive to cohort-level dynamics than it is to nurturing by the accelerator organization. For entrepreneurship scholars, the study underscores the opportunity to supplement our understanding of accelerators by focusing on within cohort dynamics, and how accelerator characteristics moderate investor decision-making. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Vertical integration and hospital performance: Evaluating physician employment in hospitals,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054556691&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.192&partnerID=40&md5=9aab8b47c77f273a3cc3dcab5b57162e,"A dramatic change in the hospital industry is the increasing emphasis on linking provider payment to quality performance metrics. This is one of several considerations leading hospitals to vertically integrate by employing physicians. Yet, there is little evidence regarding whether this form of vertical integration leads to better operational performance. Using data from 217 California hospitals that experienced a total of 417,046 eligible opportunities to conform to external performance metrics (conformance quality) for treating patients in the cardiology operating unit, we empirically evaluated the relationship between physician employment and conformance quality. We also evaluated whether certain operational conditions (health IT adoption, operational focus, and operating experience) complement or substitute for physician employment. Findings suggest that physician employment is not only positively associated with conformance quality but also associated with more consistent conformance quality. Moreover, health IT adoption is a substitute for physician employment. Theoretical, managerial, and policy implications are discussed. © 2018 Academy of Management.

We also analyze whether the presence of three VEP governance mechanisms, namely clear CEP objectives, independent oversight, and sanctions for non-compliance, impact the effectiveness of these programs. Our research builds on the limited attention to whether these programs are, in the aggregate, credible market- based alternatives to environmental regulations by providing firms with economic incentives for improving CEP, as most extant research has focused on individual programs and thus is not generalizable to the population of VEPs. We also build on research studying how differences in governance mechanisms across programs can determine whether they have positive effects on CEP and CFP for their participants. We include data from 120 primary studies on 25 VEPs between 1987 and 2015'the largest meta- analysis on this topic to date. Our results suggest that VEPs that effectively improve CEP include all three of these governance mechanisms, while VEPs that improve the CFP of their participants exclude them. Thus, it appears that VEPs are not yet designed to achieve their dual goals of helping participants improve both CEP and CFP. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Narrative interplay in the discovery of SME fundamental constraints to growth,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054557783&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.10&partnerID=40&md5=2367e8e0ccea7fcdee17f3251bfb2322,"Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital economic engines in the global economy. More directly, they improve the health of their immediate regional economic and social well-being. Scholar-practitioners with the aim to better understand the critical indicators influencing SMEs' readiness for growth continues to investigate factors encouraging or prohibiting growth. Many of these well-recognized indicators include company financial indicators, access to capital, and the characteristics of the founders themselves. Because the discovery of these key factors were primarily based on companies' self reporting of their own success stories or biggest headaches, the classification often did not illuminate the deeper story dialectics and multiplicity (Boje, 2001 & 2018) embedded in the discovery process itself and the discourse between SMEs' symptomatic reflections and the actual fundamental constraints to growth. Through exploring the story interplays shared by economic development counselors, this study first synthesizes and compares the common patterns of SME growth constraints, internally and externally to the firm, to previous research findings. The study also evaluated theory in action gaps (Argyris, 1995) between SMEs' voiced and actual scale-up headaches before and after working with their trusted companions (economic development counselors). The discovery journey between SMEs and their counselors helped SMEs gain deeper awareness of their own social realities of constraint symptoms and root causes of constraint symptoms (Savall & Zardet, 2008) and genuine meaning of agility (Worley, et al., 2015). Finally, the storytelling journey of this study itself provides scholar-practitioners useful techniques on how to work with and improve SMEs health through consulting interventions. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Yet, to date, the stakeholder literature has not explored the social aspects of these perceptions of utility in a nuanced way. The prevailing view in the literature is that stakeholders will monitor other stakeholders' interests and react negatively to their mistreatment and positively to their favorable treatment. We expand that view by predicting a wider range of reactions by the focal stakeholder to the business's treatment of other stakeholders. The model we offer in this conceptual paper pertains to how the other stakeholder will serve three different roles with respect to the focal stakeholder's utility judgments: a symbolic representation of the business's value systems, a referent for equity comparisons, and either a perceived competitor for resources or a perceived facilitator of them. Our theory adds complexity and predictive value to the traditional view of generalized exchange'a concept that lies at the core of stakeholder theory. Further, we provide a more complete understanding of stakeholder utility than currently exists. Finally, we contribute to understanding the challenge of managing divergent and sometimes competing stakeholder interests. © 2018 Academy of Management.

What is innovation anyway?

While studies show that control may indeed enable innovation, little is known about the process through which control mechanisms emerge, given the intention to enable innovation processes. This shortcoming is of crucial relevance, since control receives its enabling characteristics during the control creation and - implementation process. This paper elaborates theory on how organizational members assign meaning to control mechanisms and subsequently engage in the creation and modification of control mechanisms. In particular, we show how the interaction between deeply ingrained concertive control mechanisms, which is the shared conviction of innovation groups about what innovation is, with formal surface control mechanisms shape to which extent organizational members perceive formal controls to be congruent to their control needs. The need for particular controls emerges under conditions where organizational members experience incongruencies between formal surface controls and concertive deep controls. To mitigate these incongruencies, organizational members engage in practices aiming to calibrate formal controls to fit their control needs, and to drive the consolidation of concertive controls to safeguard the functioning of these formal controls. Our analysis shows that the way how an organization ends up to control its innovation process depends on the interaction between existing control mechanisms and the control elements it introduces to enable innovation. The theoretical framework builds on insights from a multi-year inductive field study of the transformation of an innovation process at a chemicals manufacturer. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Using meta- ethnographic data collected from 149 organizational ethnographies, we found that HPHRP and coercive control interacted such that the negative association between HPHRP and CWB was buffered by coercive control. Further analysis indicates that this interaction remained even after controlling for the monetary rewards paid to employees, suggesting that the interactions we detected were largely driven by nonmonetary HPHRP as opposed to monetary HPHRP. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Drawing on in-depth interviews, four key discursive practices used by speakers to construct an entrepreneurial identity were identified: the archetypical entrepreneur, the unique entrepreneur, the collective entrepreneur, and the entrepreneur by default. Our results are broadly in line with the literature on the identity struggles of entrepreneurs belonging to historically subordinated social groups, such as older, female and ethnic minority entrepreneurs, confirming the key role played by a combination of discursive practices that assimilate the self to the dominant discourse of the entrepreneur and practices that make room for difference through the business case. At the same time, the analysis shows that in their identity work, speakers also undermine key tenets of the dominant neoliberal discourse of the entrepreneur in two ways. First, they reconstitute entrepreneurship as a collective endeavour, rather than an individual one, emphasizing interpersonal relations and mutual dependence. Second, they de-essentialize and demystify the discourse of the entrepreneurial self by constructing entrepreneurship as 'doing' without 'being', opening up room to acknowledge barriers and contingencies affecting the self and his or her entrepreneurial undertakings. These insights speak back to the literature on the neoliberal entrepreneurial self, providing glimpses of counter- discourses which have the potential of transforming dominant understandings of entrepreneurship. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Complementor strategies in smartphone application markets,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054563904&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.216&partnerID=40&md5=d2bc0dff5a783f87545d9952c61cbbd8,"A large and increasing share of global economic activity takes place in ecosystems organized around platforms through which distinct groups conduct transactions. Smartphone application (app) markets are an increasingly important example, offering software developers a large, heterogeneous installed base of users as potential customers and low barriers to entry. However, these low barriers to entry result in intense competition for user attention, downloads, and revenues, while the appropriability regime is generally weak. In platform ecosystem settings such as this, how do producers of complementary goods and services (complementors) seek to compete, and which strategies are effective? To explore these questions, I collected rich qualitative data on 44 apps created for the Windows Phone store during their development period, as well as objective, quantitative measures of their performance post-release. The results of a qualitative comparative analysis of the cases show that developers choose to compete on combinations of novelty, execution, and owned or accessed (third-party) complementary assets, and suggest that developers over-estimate the advantages of the latter two options. These findings raise questions about what kinds of specialized complementary assets and demand-size strategies can be the basis for competition in platform ecosystems of this kind. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Cultural entrepreneurship: Towards a theory of meaning cultivation,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053262827&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.20&partnerID=40&md5=6f8fcfcadde19363201465d49b444e02,"Culture is critical for organizational and entrepreneurial outcomes, and the notion of cultural entrepreneurship is increasingly gaining currency for shedding light on the ways actors rally support for new ideas or products, or break new ground at the collective level of an industry or a market category. Despite the broad potential of cultural entrepreneurship, however, current understandings undertheorize the role that culture plays in the process, remain confined to the study of new venture legitimation and resource acquisition, or narrowly emphasize storytelling over other cultural mechanisms. Addressing these shortcomings, this paper builds an overarching framework of cultural entrepreneurship. First, we squarely put culture in cultural entrepreneurship and recast the notion as a process of meaning cultivation. We then take cultural entrepreneurship beyond entrepreneurship by delineating its conceptual boundaries in a way that is not empirically grounded but theoretically driven. Finally, beside storytelling, we advocate for a richer understanding of the cultural vehicles by which new meanings are cultivated. In sum, our central contribution is to broaden our understanding of what cultural entrepreneurship is, where it occurs, and by which means. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The polynomial regression analyses and response surface tests conducted for 235 employee'supervisor dyads generally supported the proposed fit effect for helping and voice behaviors. Employee helping behavior was higher when both employees and supervisors exhibited an early action pacing style and when both adopted a deadline action pacing style than when there was a misfit. Similarly, employees engaged in more voice behavior when their pacing style matched that of their supervisor than when there was a mismatch. Contrary to our prediction, we detected the main effect of employee pacing style on task performance, such that task performance was higher for employees with an early action pacing style than for those with a deadline action pacing style. Such a differential effect of pacing fit provides a nuanced understanding of the roles of pacing style and alignment in work outcomes. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The influence of network capability on survival also decreases under conditions of high environmental hostility but no moderation effect is found for environmental dynamism. Our results suggest that investment in dynamic capabilities in new ventures should be optimized, not maximized, for survival.

Understanding the link between governance and performance in charities,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054556942&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.244&partnerID=40&md5=c4e9df3650ad238dbd2e8faab1fc708a,"Although the relationship between governance and performance has been the focus of scholarly work for decades, most of this research has studied for-profit organizations. In contrast, the governance of nonprofit organizations have received very little attention. Therefore, our paper examines whether the governance choices implemented by a large sample of charities are linked to their performance. Charities afford a fertile context to further understand the impact of governance and agency related problems, since unlike their for-profit counterparts, they do not face mandatory governance practices. Our sample encompasses a total of $70 billion in donations across 6,741 U.S.-based charities. The findings demonstrate governance has a positive impact on charitable organizations. Specifically, the results of our study indicate that common governance practices - such as independent boards, CEO oversight, and transparency enhance the degree to which charitable contributions are allocated toward the mission of these organizations. Overall, we find that despite the often- assumed altruistic orientation of charitable organizations, governance practices can play a critical role in these settings. Our study has important implications for agency theory, corporate governance and the broader application of for-profit logic in nonprofit settings. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Prior research has mainly described the characteristics of and functional roles within these virtual organizations, but few have examined which community members take on roles of lateral authority, or investigated what drives the progression of developers from peripheral roles to core roles. We develop and test a theoretical framework, which explains developers' pace of progression from periphery to core through technical contributions and communication activity. Our approach differs from prior research by highlighting the moderating role of developers' focus regarding their community engagement. Using unique longitudinal data from the Linux kernel development project, our results suggest that the positive influence of technical contributions is negatively moderated when developers make broad, rather than focused, contributions to different subsystems. Conversely, the positive effect of communication activity is amplified the more developers engage in conversations on different topics and the more they respond to the queries of other community members. Our findings contribute to research on lateral governance in OSS communities, and to the more general debate on the benefits of specialization. © 2018 Academy of Management.

We find that firms that iterate more frequently are more productive overall in their holistic search effort, but must face fundamental trade-offs between pursuing exploitative search and exploratory search. While rapidly iterating firms were more likely to sample distant neighborhoods on their search landscape, they ultimately invested in exploitative search at the expense of exploratory search.

In this study, we analyze the impact of the human genome, a detailed scientific map, on drug discovery. In the drug industry, deep understanding of disease is essential for designing new therapeutics. Two mechanisms are explored by which scientific maps influence technological search: 1) predictive power and precision of the map can alter existing search strategies and novelty of outcomes 2) public nature of the map can attract new entrants, leading to more competition and stronger efforts to protect intellectual property. Analyses reveal a sharp increase in small-molecule drug patenting and patented compounds coinciding with the public release of gene sequences. Using a difference-in-differences estimation we find that the availability of the human genome is an exogenous shock that increases novel compound production across the industry by 64%, controlling for new tools like combinatorial chemistry. Together, these reveal an interesting finding' open access scientific maps not only increase the rate and technological novelty of invention, but also spur industry competition suggesting that publicly-funded science like the human genome can enhance both quantity and quality of industry innovation. © 2018 Academy of Management.

This paper investigates whether cues of morality can mitigate stock sell-offs in the face of earnings uncertainty, and draws on Moral Foundations Theory to study the effect of universal moral cues (Harm/Care and Fairness/Reciprocity rhetoric) and primarily conservative moral cues (Ingroup/Loyalty, Authority/Respect and Purity/Sanctity rhetoric) on market performance.

This leaves unexplored the identity work that is done when relations itself are equivocal and changing. Building on a few studies that delved into the interpersonal and situational dimensions of identity work, we address the question how actors mutually position themselves vis-vis others in interactional dynamics. Our ethnographic analysis of everyday encounters between nurses, residents and relatives in a Dutch nursing home, shows how 'relational identity work' is performed through 'self-other matching' (mutually re-affirming), 'self-other mismatching' (mutually negating) and 'shifting' between different identity patterns. Subsequently, we analyze complications of relational identity work as a third actor enters the stage and mixes up the dynamics of workplace relations. Clarifying how organizational actors shape a flexible sense of self vis-vis multiple others, our exploration opens up the field of identity studies for analyzing interactional dynamics of workplace relations. In doing so, we explain how relational identity work between multiple actors impacts the formation of partnerships in- and around organizations when the configuration of relations is changing. © 2018 Academy of Management.

As research has shown team composition to be a predictor of team performance, informed staffing of such teams based on team members' demographics seems promising. However, mixed and inconclusive findings regarding how team diversity affects team performance accentuate the need for simultaneously considering multiple diversity attributes, as emphasized by the literature on faultlines. We therefore theorize that organizational diversity in inter-organizational teams becomes a liability when the team members are diverse on another attribute (i.e., age), and that performance effects of resulting diversity faultlines are contingent upon their location within the team. We test our hypotheses with archival sports data of 7,514 individuals from 336 national soccer teams at fourteen FIFA World Cups. Our results show that, with increasing levels of age diversity, the positive performance effect of organizational diversity is reversed. Moreover, abandoning the assumption that team members equally contribute to their teams' performance, faultline strength turned out to be beneficial for team performance when the faultline separated the core team members from the peripheral ones, whereas faultline strength impeded team performance when the faultline existed within the core team. We discuss resulting implications for theory development on inter-organizational teams. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Based on our fsQCA methodology, we find that none of the conditions we identified is either sufficient or necessary to achieve environmental legitimacy. More specifically, results indicate that (a) that environmental performance and legitimacy are not necessarily associated in a one-to-one relationship; (b) that the combination of internal adaptation and impression management initiatives might be less effective in generating legitimacy than expected; and (c) that global and local strategies can both lead to high legitimacy when appropriately complemented. © 2018 Academy of Management.

"Asymmetric regulation, managerial discretion, and corporate political strategies",2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054561029&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.225&partnerID=40&md5=76be481da1dfb026efee0bc091908ac2,"We study why managers engage in corporate political strategizing. Our rigorous data driven historical study of top management strategizing, of a state-owned telecommunications provider for a period of 18 years, exposes previously unattended links between top management’s managerial discretion and engagement in political strategizing. We find two managerial discretion dilemmas triggering political strategizing during market convergence: (1) resource discretion due to asymmetric regulation; and (2) market discretion due to unbalanced competitive preconditions. We contribute with a novel understanding of the contextual and managerial antecedents of political strategizing, and a dynamic view on managerial discretion. Furthermore, we advance a rigorous digital history approach, one that is historically cognizant and temporally and contextually grounded, to study top management strategizing. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Deep received cosmologies during sensemaking: A mixed-method study of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054564671&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.268&partnerID=40&md5=0bacd1f3f03b1bb6bcc231683ddc85df,"As scholars continue to seek ways to break through the thickening membrane that separates academics from executives, funding organizations such as The Templeton Foundation are championing alternative methods of scholarly writing – seeking to upgrade scholars’ capacity to communicate with executives in position to reduce suffering in the world. For example, Karl Weick and Kathleen Sutcliffe (2015) have influenced a generation of international executives seeking to prevent cosmology episodes in the workplace. Following their lead, other management scholars are engaged in attempts to resolve a set of global “grand challenges” (e.g. de Rond & Lok, 2016; Kim & Davis, 2016; and Luo, Zhang, & Marquis, 2016). In this article, similarly, we focus on a specific component in the anatomy of cosmology episodes (anticipating, sense-losing, improvising, sense-remaking, renewing); more specifically, we address the role of deep cosmologies in the anticipating processes before a nation, community, organization, team, or individual is aware that they have entered into a cosmology episode. We juxtapose two complementary data sets – seeking primarily to communicate evidence-based research on the strategic management of cosmology episodes to leaders of humanitarian aid organizations. The first data set is a group of 138 sensemaking episodes drawn from a valuable census of management research articles published within the arena of “extreme context research” (Hallgren, Rouleau, & de Rond, in press), with a primary focus on sensemaking episodes published in Organization Studies. The second data set is our field notes from teaching the psychology of religion and disasters at Renmin University in Beijing, China, in a two-week course in July 2013 and a a four-week course in July 2014. Fusing these two data sets is an attempt to expand on Weick’s (2006) assertion that “Faith and belief are prerequisites to organizing and sensemaking” and to elaborate on Weick’s differentiation between faith (as “deep cosmologies”) from beliefs (as “shallow cognitions”). © 2018 Academy of Management.

MacIntyre (1981) argued that essential to telos-guided leadership is the development of virtues, practices and goods. This article finds that the salient virtues of higher-order purposeful leadership are humility, gratitude and justice, which involve the subjugation of the entrepreneurs self to the needs of others. Pertinent practices are identified as clarity of direction and more equitable resource allocation, which emerged from leaders expanded sense of connectedness. Goods produced involve significant systemic change and mutual transcendence, guided by a deep ecological awareness that goes beyond duality and short- term goals. This article highlights the need to include a concern for others into our understanding of leadership. © 2018 Academy of Management.

This study categorizes CSR activities into four groups'Xsociety, the environment, employee, and consumers' Xand provides an overview and a comparison of CSR activities in an emerging economy in Asia. This study focuses on the reputation effect for negative CSR events and compares the performance of the CSR-awarded and non-awarded firms for negative CSR activities. The results show that, in Taiwan, positive CSR activities are accompanied by a significant amount of positive stock price reactions and better long-term performance, which is consistent with the evidence found in the literature. However, compared with non-awarded firms, when CSR-awarded firms experience negative CSR events, their investors will impose stricter punishments. Consequently, the short- and long-term performances of CSR-awarded firms are inferior to those of non-awarded firms. © 2018 Academy of Management.

This often constitutes a critical juncture for employee morale, with the risk of losing key talent. We posit that limiting the disruptive effect of changing organizational structures requires organizational members to not only adopt new roles and procedures but also change their cognitive representations regarding how the firm operates. We use an inductive multi-case study to explore changes in interpretive schemes of key organizational logics and the presence of catalysts that guide cognitive change during a founder-CEO succession. By contrasting our case material with exogenous employee satisfaction data, we develop testable propositions about key conditions that allow maintaining company morale during structural change of entrepreneurial organizations. © 2018 Academy of Management.

However, our understanding regarding potential drawbacks of open collaborative approaches for innovation is still limited. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between R&D collaboration and the departure of skilled employees. Scientists and engineers who interact with external partners for innovation may increase their outside options, resulting in higher rates of employee mobility to other firms and employee entrepreneurship. We examine our research question using a representative Panel dataset that combines information from the Swedish Community Innovation (CIS) survey with employer-employee register data. Our econometric analysis suggests that a stronger use of research collaborations by firms leads to an increasing number of exits of skilled employees. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Employee incentives in microfinance institutions: Examining the importance of diversification and profit status,2018,"78th Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management, AOM 2018",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054562245&doi=10.5465%2fAMBPP.2018.123&partnerID=40&md5=fc5e2a6fa6d2f9dd436518a89cc7cde0,"Non-profits across the economy are being pressured to take on the human resource management practices of for-profits, including the use of pay-for- performance. However, the use of pay-for-performance and competitive salaries is often thought to conflict with the non-profit business model, due to multidimensional organizational objectives and the effect of monetary incentives on intrinsically motivated employees. In this paper, I argue that performance-based pay can actually be effective if non-profit employees are driven by both the intrinsic value of the mission and a relational contract with the firm, wherein performance-based pay serves as a signal of organizational mission, rather than an effort-inducing financial incentive. The context of this paper is the microfinance industry, with data that includes observations on both for-profit and non-profit firms and variables that capture both financial and social goals. This data allows me to examine the ways in which non-profits utilize employee incentives and how they compare with for-profits in the same industry. I find that non-profit organizations, on average, pay employees less and utilize a lower level of performance-based pay. Further, non-profit organizations that make smaller loans reward employees on more dimensions than other microfinance firms. Even controlling for the products and services that firms offer, some differences in employee compensation between for-profit and non-profit organizations remain. This result suggests that neither the explanation of intrinsic motivation of employees nor the distinct products and services offered completely explains the different salary structures in non-profit organizations; rather different incentive dimensions may be used to signal the non-profits goals. © 2018 Academy of Management.
